This trend has led to a flurry of related researches in many fields, such as\n\ndynamics, telecommunications, remote sensing, architecture, and many others. While\n\nfirst pioneering studies and proposals date back to the 1980s, and further systematic\n\nworks, mainly on dynamics, were published in the 1990s, it is in this last decade that a\n\nhuge worldwide effort to further develop such a concept has been demonstrated.\n\nSome missions relaying on two cooperative satellites have already been successfully\n\naccomplished:GRACE (aimed at gravimetry), PRISMA (a technology demonstrator),\n\nand Tandem-X (an Earth observation mission embarking a Synthetic Aperture Radar\n\ninterferometer) represent great achievements in space system engineering. They will\n\nlikely be the precursors of enhanced future missions.\n\nThanks to these researches, it is widely recognized that upcoming space systems\n\nwill make use of collaborating platforms to replace current monolithic systems and\n\nto implement missions otherwise impossible (e.g., those requiring very large sensor\n\napertures). Such evolution calls for a revolutionary change of mentality in design,\n\nrealization, and operation at various levels. At payload level, one has to assess the\n\ncapability to integrate the mission payload using different elementary payloads\n\nonboard various satellites. In addition, new concepts (e.g., modularity, autonomy,\n\nstandardization, plug & play components) must be explored to attain an efficient\n\nbus implementation and new subsystems (e.g., relative trajectory design, relative\n\nnavigation and control, satellite interlink) are to be implemented to enable the\n\nrequired new functions.\n\nAlthough the approach to distributed space missions is thus inherently multidisci-\n\nplinary, researches have often been focused on specific topics. For instance, if on the\n\none hand relative trajectory dynamics has been thoroughly studied and many steps\n\nforward have been made in the last decade, on the other hand such issues have often\n\nbeen considered independently from the payload. In addition, interesting results have\n\nbeen published on the distributed sensor concept, but have rarely considered the issues\n\nraised by orbital dynamics. Finally, the technological challenges (measurements,\n\ncoordination, communications) behind a multi-satellite system have only been\n\nvii\n\n\n\npartially tackled and exploited. This book, Distributed Systems for Earth System\nMonitoring, is an effort to present in a unique environment its state of the art and\ndemonstrate through different experiences the variety of themes which characterize\n\ndistributed space systems with the aim to better highlight their strong connections.\n\nThe book is organized in four parts and 23 chapters. Part I is devoted to the\n\nanalysis of distributed Synthetic Aperture Radars: bistatic and multistatic radars are\n\npresented in two chapters. Following this, relative dynamics and guidance, naviga-\n\ntion, and control are the subjects in Part II, which consists of five chapters, wherein\n\nthe different topics are developed with reference to relative trajectory: (a) design,\n\n(b) establishment, maintenance and control, and (c) measurements. This latter topic\n\nis tackled by considering three different approaches for navigation: Global Posi-\n\ntioning System, radio frequency, and vision-based metrologies. Technological\n\nchallenges connected to distributed space missions are the topic in Part III, where\n\nthe impacts of the distributed approaches are discussed with reference to autonomy,\n\nnavigation, and communications (space to space and space to ground). Finally, Part\n\nIV reports on a number of missions and studies which have been performed in\n\nrecent years to analyze how and to what extent the distributed concept has been\n\nstudied and applied. This part covers radar missions (e.g., Tandem-X), gravimetry\n\nmissions (e.g., Grace), and technology demonstration missions (e.g., PRISMA).\n\nChapter 23, the last concluding chapter, reflects the authors\u2019 opinions on the future\n\ntrends, the potentials and the risks of the distributed space mission approach.\n\nThe book, written within the activity of a Study Group of the International\n\nAcademy of Astronautics,1 is coauthored by 52 authors from seven countries and\n\nfrom many institutions (universities, research centers, industries, and agencies).\n\nA large group of authors with a variety of professional figures have been required to\n\ncover the wide range of topics discussed and to reflect the different opinions and\n\napproaches available. I hope that we have been successful in our efforts to offer a\n\ncommon but articulated synthesis.\n\nThe coordination of such a group was not an easy task. I want to thank all the\n\nauthors for their contributions, for the patience in responding to my requests, and\n\nfor their efforts to keep up with schedule. I am very grateful to and thank Springer\n\nstaff and, in particular, Maury Solomon and Megan Ernst, who, frequently solicited\n\nby my questions, doubts, and requests, have always found a way forward.\n\nFinally, I would like to say thank you to Antonio Moccia, who introduced me to\n\nthe space field since the times of my M.Sc. dissertation. His silent and coherent\n\nexample is a continuous clear guide to all those young people walking on the bridge\n\nbetween educational and professional lives. Last, but not least, I am grateful to\n\nRainer Sandau, who introduced me to the International Academy of Astronautics\n\nand its international context. Without his support, advice, and encouragement,\n\nI would never have dared to propose and coordinate this book.\n\nAversa, Italy Marco D\u2019Errico\n\n1 This is currently in the process of approval by the Board of Trustees of the International Academy\n\nof Astronautics.\n\nviii Preface\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\nDomenico Accardo He is Assistant Professor of Avionics, AIAA senior member,\n\nand International Member in the AIAA Sensor Systems Technical Committee.

In addition, Bistatic and Multistatic SAR\n\nconcepts are tightly related to formation flying and distributed space missions that\n\nalso represent the new space-based remote sensing and surveillance frontiers. This\n\nchapter introduces Bistatic SAR, in particular by comparing its peculiarities,\n\noperation and performance with respect to conventional monostatic SAR. Some\n\nbasic concepts of bistatic SAR image formation and the main elements of bistatic\n\nSAR geometry are preliminary presented. Performance parameters are then\n\nanalyzed, including geometric resolution, radiometric resolution and bistatic radar\n\nequation. Special emphasis is placed on analytical methods to evaluate the effects\n\nof bistatic SAR geometry on image resolution. Further implementation issues, such\n\nas footprint, time and phase synchronization are also pointed out. The analysis of\n\npast bistatic radar and bistatic SAR experiments and proposed spaceborne bistatic\n\nSAR missions supplies essential information to understand how these issues have\n\nbeen faced and can be potentially solved in ongoing and future operational systems.\n\nFinally, several scientific applications of bistatic SAR are outlined taking\n\nadvantages of different techniques and methods.\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nBistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a distributed observation system based\n\non transmission and reception of frequency modulated microwave signals. As the\n\nname suggests an exhaustive definition of Bistatic SAR involves the presentation of\n\ntwo distinct concepts, namely bistatic radar and synthetic aperture.\n\nA. Moccia (*) \u2022 A.

M. Siegel and\n\nR. E. Machol [1], the early experimental radars, developed before World War II,\n\nwere actually of bistatic type, with the transmitter and the receiver separated by a\n\ndistance comparable to the radar-target one. Moreover, since most of the early radar\n\nexperiments were conducted utilizing the existing communication technology,\n\ncontinuous wave (CW) transmissions and very low frequencies (25\u201380 MHz)\n\nwere adopted, with ground-based configurations devoted to aircraft detection.\n\nSuccessively, the invention of the duplexer [1] allowed the radar system to use\n\npulses of finite time duration with a common transmit and receive antenna thus\n\nleading to the monostatic configuration. The monostatic radar became in a short\ntime a standard for radar implementations especially for use by moving platforms,\n\nsuch as aircrafts, ships and mobile ground units. However, bistatic radar retains\n\nseveral unique features making it very interesting both for civil and defense\n\napplications. First, the receiver, in principle, can be simple, compact and light-\n\nweight not needing radar transmitting chain. Then, bistatic receivers are able to\n\nwork without revealing their position so they can become undetectable when\n\noperating in tactical scenarios. Moreover, while it is relatively affordable to develop\n\nstealth capabilities against a monostatic illuminator, echoes reflected in other\n\ndirections cannot be easily reduced and therefore they can be collected by proper\n\nbistatic receivers. Finally both monostatic and bistatic data reflected by common\n\ncovered areas can be collected to improve, quantitatively and qualitatively, the\n\ncharacterization of the observed target or scene. This last feature highlights how in\n\nbistatic radar two types of transmitting systems, or illuminators, can be envisaged:\n\n\u2022 Cooperating, i.e. the transmitter and the receiver are designed and developed\njointly for carrying out common and specific tasks such as the acquisition of\n\nmonostatic data together with bistatic ones. However, even if monostatic opera-\n\ntion is not enabled, cooperating systems are implemented when the illuminator\n\nprovides the bistatic receiver with additional timing and navigation information,\n\nsuch as transmitted oscillator state for coherent processing or position and\n\nvelocity of transmitting antenna phase center.\n\n\u2022 Non-cooperating, i.e. the receiver exploits the electromagnetic signal radiated\nby an independent and uncoordinated source, a so-called illuminator of oppor-\ntunity, such as GPS or broadcasting satellites and TV or radio towers [2]. In this\nframework the terms parasitic receivers or hitchhiking radar have been also\n\nutilized [1, 2].\n\nAs far as synthetic aperture is concerned, the concept of synthetic aperture radar\n\nas mapping sensor was first introduced by Carl Wiley in 1951 [3]. Basically\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a chirp radar that exploits amplitude and\n\nphase of the received echoes [4]. It is therefore able to produce an image by\n\nmeasuring backscattered pulses as a function of time delay and Doppler shift,\n\nthus determining the radar complex reflectivity for each range-Doppler terrain\n\ncell. Values from different cells are combined to form a two dimensional image.\n\nAs in traditional real aperture radar, the synthetic radar beam is directed to the side\n\n4 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nof the platform trajectory. The antenna is designed to have sufficiently wide beam\n\nwidth in the along-track direction so that a given target or area is illuminated by a\n\nnumber of pulses. The number of illuminating pulses is typically on the order of\n\nthousand for a spaceborne SAR and the ensemble of locations of the antenna during\n\nthe illumination of a given target constitutes the synthetic aperture of the system.\nThe length of the synthetic aperture is typically 3\u20137 km for spacecraft and\n\n60\u2013100 m for aircraft [4], hence impossible to be carried on a single aerospace\n\nsystem. Monostatic SAR, with a single antenna, high-power transmitter and high-\n\nsensitive receiver onboard the same air or space platform represents today a mature\n\nremote sensing and surveillance system and it is routinely utilized in a wide range\n\nof commercial and scientific applications.\n\nOn the basis of these preliminary remarks it is possible to state that Bistatic\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar is a SAR with separated transmitting and receiving\n\nantennas. Similarly to multistatic SAR, it is based on multiple transmitting and\n\nreceiving antenna positions. The realization of air or space bi-/multistatic SAR\n\ninvolves the coordinate use of multiple systems, possibly operating in separate\n\nlocations or platforms, with accurate time synchronization and antenna pointing\n\nbetween transmitters and receivers and with accurate measurement and control of\n\nrelative positions, i.e. implementing formation flying strategies, even when\n\nilluminators of opportunity are considered. Apparently bistatic/multistatic SAR is\n\nmore demanding than a monostatic one, due to the necessity of forming synthetic\n\nantennas synchronizing more than one system. However the above statements on\n\nSAR, which are reported more or less similar in every classic textbook when\n\nintroducing the synthetic aperture concept (see for example [5, 6]), can be rephrased\n\nwith reference to formation flying and antenna synchronization as showed in\n\nFig. 1.1, i.e. with reference to bi-/multistatic SAR.\n\nHence, Bistatic/Multistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar is a concept as old as\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar, although there was not a clear awareness of that the\n\nvery beginning. Actually, even a monostatic SAR is basically a distributed (i.e.\n\nmultistatic) system, at least from the image formation and data processing point of\n\nview.\n\nIn addition, this way of interpreting SAR behavior highlights how Bistatic and\n\nMultistatic SAR concepts are tightly related to the new spaceborne remote sensing\n\nand surveillance frontier to which the present book is devoted: formation flying.\n\nAlso in formation flying [7], indeed, groupings of duplicate or similar satellites have\n\nsensors in common or are complementary related, talk to each other, share payloads\n\nor mission functions, and are in one or more ways synchronized. In summary, it is\n\npossible to state that dealing with Bistatic/Multistatic SAR means dealing with the\n\nfuture of spaceborne (and airborne) remote sensing systems.\n\nHitherto, the related implementation challenges have contributed to restrain the\n\ndevelopment of bistatic SAR systems. Limited bistatic experiences have been\n\ntherefore reported in the literature [8] and the first operative bistatic SAR mission\n\nis TanDEM-X [9, 10], launched only in 2010, and realizing a spaceborne bistatic\n\nSAR interferometer based on two LEO satellites flying in close formation. Research\n\nin airborne and spaceborne bistatic SAR, however, has been recently intensified and\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 5\n\n\n\nit is very likely that bistatic SAR will go beyond the experimental level in the near\n\nfuture, pressed by the potential vast amount of scientific and practical tasks bistatic\n\nSAR can fulfill.\n\nThis chapter is organized as follows. Section 1.2 introduces the basic concepts of\n\nbistatic SAR image formation and defines the main elements of bistatic SAR\n\ngeometry. The concept of critical baseline is also presented to stress the different\n\ninformation content between coherent and incoherent combinations of bistatic data.\n\nPerformance parameters are introduced in Sect. 1.3. In detail, Sect. 1.3.1 shows\n\nsome analytical methods to evaluate the effects of bistatic SAR geometry on the\n\ngeometric resolution, whereas radiometric resolution and bistatic radar equation are\n\nanalyzed in Sect. 1.3.2. Further implementation issues, such as footprint, time and\n\nphase synchronization are presented in Sect. 1.3.3. The analysis of past bistatic\n\nradar (Sect. 1.4.1) and SAR (Sect. 1.4.2) experiments and proposed spaceborne\n\nSAR missions (Sect. 1.4.3) supplies essential information to highlight how these\n\nissues have been faced and can be potentially solved in ongoing and future opera-\n\ntional systems. Finally, several scientific applications of bistatic SAR are outlined\n\nin Sect. 1.5 taking advantages of different techniques and methods.\n\nFig. 1.1 Interpretation of SAR as distributed radar system\n\n6 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\n1.2 Bistatic SAR Geometry and Configurations\n\nThree elements form the basic bistatic SAR configuration: the transmitter or\n\nilluminator, the receiver and the target or observed scene. The illuminator transmits\n\na sequence of frequency modulated pulses towards the target area while following\n\nits trajectory (see Fig. 1.2). Those pulses are reflected from the scene thus\n\ngenerating a sequence of bistatic echoes that are collected by the receiver. In\n\ngeneral the receiver is a moving platform too. For this configuration the start-and-\n\nstop approximation [11] can be assumed, that is transmitter and receiver antennas\n\nare considered to be at a standstill during ranging signal propagation, and they move\n\non the next position only after the echo is received. According to this hypothesis the\n\nsignal can be modeled as a function of two independent variables: the fast time and\nthe slow time. The fast time is the time scale which scans the transmission/reception\nof the pulses at the velocity of light, whereas the slow time is the time scale which\n\nscans successive positions of transmitter and receiver along the synthetic aperture,\n\nat a velocity which is negligible with respect to the velocity of light. A raw bistatic\n\nSAR image is then generated by the sequence of transmitted/received pulses as a\n\nfunction of the fast and slow time. Pulse compression techniques [4\u20136] are utilized\n\nexploiting the frequency modulation of the transmitter pulses to enhance the fast\n\ntime or range resolution. As far as the slow time is concerned the Doppler frequency\n\nmodulation, or Doppler history, due to the relative motion among transmitter,\n\nreceiver and target can be tracked and hence compressed as done for the fast time\n\nsignals. In this context, as noted in the introduction, bistatic SAR image formation\n\nand focusing resemble those of conventional monostatic SAR: coherent processing\n\nis utilized even if different relations and models have to be utilized to perform\n\nDoppler compression and to relate fast and slow time with conventional geometric\n\nand cartographic image coordinates. Indeed, in conventional monostatic SAR two\n\ndirections can be individuated immediately, namely the along-track or azimuth\n\ndirection, parallel to the motion of platform relative to observed scene, and across-\n\ntrack direction orthogonal to the previous one. The fast time or range resolution\n\nis relevant to across-track direction and the slow-time or Doppler resolution to\n\nFig. 1.2 Illustration of bistatic SAR raw image formation\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 7\n\n\n\nalong-track direction. A monostatic SAR image is therefore naturally defined in\n\nalong-track and across-track components. In bistatic SAR, instead, the relative\n\npositions and velocities between transmitter and receiver turn out to be completely\n\narbitrary. In such general conditions neither across-track nor along-track directions\n\nstrictly exist, and therefore new definitions and models are needed as Sect. 1.3 will\n\nshow. Moreover it is important to remark that a pulsed working mode has been\n\npresented for simplicity, but bistatic operation also allows for CW transmissions\n\nand receptions to be used. Possible impacts of such CW schemes on bistatic SAR\n\nimage formations will be discussed in Sect. 1.3.3.\n\nThe basic bistatic SAR configuration can operate in a wide range of bistatic\n\ngeometries. For the sake of individuating the most notable ones a set of geometric\n\nparameters can be introduced. The bistatic synthetic aperture, indeed, is determined\n\nby relative geometry and motion among transmitter, receiver and target area,\n\ni.e. transmitter and receiver positions, ~PTx and ~PRx , transmitter and receiver\nvelocities, ~VTx and ~VRx , target position, ~r , target velocity ~v , and transmitter and\nreceiver slant ranges, RTx and RRx. Classic bistatic radar literature [1] utilizes two\nparameters to define the bistatic geometry: the baseline,~B, that is the vector from the\ntransmitter to the receiver, and the bistatic angle, b, that is the transmitter-target-\nreceiver angle. However, as far as imaging radar applications are concerned, it is\n\nworth introducing transmitter and receiver incidence angles, YTx and YRx respec-\ntively, and transmitter out-of-plane angle, ?, too.\n\nFigure 1.3 represents a general bistatic SAR geometry and illustrates main\n\nrelevant parameters defined with respect to an arbitrary Earth-fixed Cartesian\n\nreference frame. According to those parameters various bistatic SAR geometries\n\ncan be defined:\n\n\u2022 In-plane same-side, with the transmitter within the range elevation plane of the\nreceiving antenna and at the same side with respect to the target, i.e. ? = 0.\n\nFig. 1.3 General bistatic\n\nSAR geometry\n\n8 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\n\u2022 In-plane opposite-side, with the transmitter within the range elevation plane\nof the receiving antenna but at the opposite side with respect to the target,\n\ni.e. ? = 180?.\n\u2022 Out-of-plane, ? ? 0 and ? ? 180.\n\u2022 Nadir-looking transmitter, ?Tx = 0, or receiver, ?Rx = 0.\n\nFurthermore, the receiver can perform different observations depending on its\n\nlooking direction. Specifically side-looking, forward-looking and squinted-mode\nreceivers are implemented when the receiving antenna is pointed, respectively to\n\nthe side of the platform trajectory, along platform trajectory directed forwards or\n\nbackwards, or otherwise.\n\nThe basic bistatic SAR configuration can be enriched in different ways. First of\n\nall, monostatic operation can be exploited together with bistatic ones [12], namely\n\nthe transmitter also receives the echoes backscattered from the target area and\n\ntherefore a pair of monostatic-bistatic images of the same region can be generated.\n\nIn such a monostatic-bistatic configuration additional time requirements are set:\n\nCW transmissions cannot be used since they would hinder monostatic data from\n\nbeing received. Moreover, even though pulsed transmission schemes are utilized,\n\nboth monostatic and bistatic Doppler bandwidths have to be unambiguously sam-\n\npled for monostatic and bistatic slow time compression. This is not problematic if\n\nrelatively close monostatic-bistatic configurations are utilized (e.g. for LEO\n\nsatellites flying in formations), in which monostatic and bistatic Doppler histories\n\nare alike, but complications could be caused in general geometries when the motion\n\ncharacteristic of the transmitter are very different from those of the receiver (e.g. for\n\ntransmitter and receiver flying at different altitudes or working in different looking\n\nmodes).\n\nMore demanding bistatic SAR configurations involve the utilization of multiple\n\nreceivers and/or multiple transmitters [13]. In this context, a single transmitter can\n\nbe source of illumination for several bistatic SAR receivers covering a given target\n\narea but also MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) SAR architectures can be\n\nenvisaged with more, monostatic or non monostatic, transmitters.\n\nFrom the data exploitation point of view when a bistatic SAR configuration is\n\nimplemented, able to generate multiple bistatic (or monostatic-bistatic) images of the\n\nsame area, it is necessary to compare and combine in some way these images, thus\n\nimproving the achievable characterization level of the observed scene. As a result of\n\nthe coherent SAR focusing the output of bistatic SAR processors is a complex image.\n\nTwo or more bistatic images can be therefore compared both in amplitude and in\n\nphase. When both amplitude and phase are used a coherent combination is formed,\nwhereas in an incoherent combination only amplitude differences among the bistatic\ndata are taken into account.\n\nEvidently, a coherent combination can be properly exploited only if there is an\n\nadequate phase correlation among the considered data. In bistatic SAR\n\nconfigurations, the degree of phase correlation is mainly determined by the separa-\n\ntion among the receivers. In this concern, the concept of critical baseline can be\nintroduced: the critical value for the baseline is the one causing complete loss of\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 9\n\n\n\ncorrelation between focused SAR images [14, 15]. This means that a coherent\n\ncombination can be derived only if the separation between the receivers is shorter\n\nthan the critical baseline. The actual value of the critical baseline strictly depends\n\non the intended application of the considered coherent combination, e.g. along-\n\ntrack interferometry or cross-track interferometry (see Sect. 1.5.2.1 and Chap. 2 for\n\nthe details). The critical baseline for cross-track interferometry can be assumed as\n\nfigure of merit to derive the order of magnitude of critical separation. For this\n\napplication, the critical value corresponds to the baseline for which the variation in\n\nphase difference between adjacent resolution elements is 2?. According to the\nmodels developed in Refs. [14, 15] and extended to bistatic SAR operations [9,\n\n16] the critical baseline is\n\nB? \u00bc lRRxDrg cosYRx (1.1)\n\nwhere ? is the wavelength and ?rg is the bistatic ground range resolution. The\nsymbol ? indicates that the critical baseline computed by (1.1) is not the actual\nseparation among the receivers, but it is the baseline component along the direction\n\northogonal to the line of sight.\n\nFor simplicity only the orthogonal critical baseline will be considered in the\n\nremainder of this section, even if the actual baseline could be derived accordingly\n\nonce the bistatic configuration is defined. Furthermore, it is important to remark that\n\n(1.1) returns the critical baseline for all introduced bistatic SAR configurations,\n\nspecifically (1.1) can be utilized to calculate the critical baseline for:\n\n\u2022 Monostatic-bistatic SAR configurations, in this case the baseline is the separa-\n\ntion between the monostatic (i.e. transmitting/receiving) sensor and the bistatic\n\n(receiving-only) one;\n\n\u2022 Multistatic SAR configurations, in this case the baseline is the separation among\n\nall the sensors that receive bistatic echoes from the same transmitter.\n\nFigure 1.4 reports the critical baseline for different bistatic SAR formations,\n\nnamely Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Geosynchronous\n\nEarth Orbit (GEO) formations, and a bistatic SAR characterized by Moon-based\n\nstations. All of these formations have been proposed for Earth remote sensing by\n\ncross-track SAR interferometry (see for example [13, 17, 18]). From Fig. 1.4 it is\n\nimmediate to conclude that the critical baseline is always a small fraction of the\n\nslant range distance.\n\nIn order to preserve phase correlation, the working baseline must be a fraction of\n\nthe critical one (a value from 5% to 10% has been selected in Refs. [9, 10] for\n\nTanDEM-X mission), this means that very close formations (with baseline lower\n\nthan 1\u20132 km) have to be considered for LEO bistatic SAR. The baselines increase\n\nfrom hundreds to thousands of kilometers from MEO or geosynchronous to Moon-\n\nbased bistatic systems. These huge baselines, however, have to be interpreted also\n\nconsidering the relevant enormous slant ranges. Indeed, the same bistatic angle,\n\n10 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_2\n\n\nreported in Fig. 1.5, is attained for all introduced bistatic formations: as a matter of\n\nfact the bistatic angle is very small in any case.\n\nAs noted above, the critical baseline changes if coherent combinations are used\n\nfor a different application, such as moving target indication (MTI) by along-track\n\ninterferometry. In this case the baseline sets the maximum and the minimum target\n\nvelocities the bistatic SAR can detect. In general both velocities depend on the ratio\n\nbetween satellite platform velocity and baseline [19]. For LEO orbits useful\n\nbaselines are limited to hundreds of meters [9, 10, 20], and even shorted separations\n\nwould be of interests for higher altitudes.\n\nIn conclusion, it is possible to state that in coherent bistatic combinations very\n\nlimited variations of the observation geometry has to be expected among the\n\ndifferent receivers forming the bi-/multistatic SAR system.\n\nFig. 1.4 Critical baseline for different bistatic SAR formations and wavelength (3 m ground range\n\nresolution, X-band l \u00bc 3.1 cm, C-band l \u00bc 5.6 cm, L-band l \u00bc 24 cm): (a) LEO, (b) MEO,\n(c) GEO, (d) Moon-based\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 11\n\n\n\n1.3 System Performance\n\nParameters determining bistatic SAR performance strictly depends on the intended\n\napplication. For instance in coherent combinations the capability to reduce phase\n\nnoise and biases is essential. However, as for all imaging sensors, some common\n\nparameters can be individuated to define system performance, the most notable\n\nexample being the resolution.\nResolution is defined as the capability to distinguish close targets on the ground.\n\nSpecifically, geometric resolution deals with the separation in one or more\ndimensions of two targets with the same amplitude, i.e. the same brightness in the\n\nresulting image. In synthetic aperture radar such dimensions are (slant or ground)\n\nrange and Doppler [4\u20136]. In addition radiometric resolution can be introduced and\nit is in general defined as the capability of the sensor to distinguish between targets\n\ncharacterized by different brightness in SAR images, depending on their different\n\nscattering properties along with instrument sensitivity. The effects of bistatic\n\nsystem parameters, such as acquisition geometry, bandwidth and integration time\n\non geometric resolution is presented in Sect. 1.3.1. As in monostatic SAR radio-\n\nmetric resolution is essentially influenced by Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and\n\nadditional speckle-generated noise. However bistatic SAR geometry and bistatic\n\nscattering properties, as reported in Sect. 1.3.2, play an important role too.\n\nFig. 1.5 Bistatic angles corresponding to the critical baselines reported in Fig. 1.4 (3 m ground\n\nrange resolution assumed)\n\n12 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nAdditional performance parameters concern timing, pointing and synchroniza-\n\ntion issues. Again, part of these problems are conceptually similar to those of\n\nmonostatic SAR, such as pulse repetition frequency selection, whereas other ones\n\nare peculiar of bistatic system, e.g. low-frequency phase errors are generated by the\n\nuse of two different oscillators, the first in transmission, and the second in reception.\n\nBasic concepts and relevant effects on SAR imaging are reported in Sect. 1.3.3.\n\n1.3.1 Geometric Resolution\n\nSynthetic aperture radar utilizes frequency modulated signals to achieve high fast\n\ntime resolution, whereas the Doppler frequency modulation of the received signal,\n\ndue to relative motion among transmitter, receiver and target is exploited to\n\nenhance slow time resolution. In conventional side-looking monostatic SAR fast\n\ntime resolution corresponds to the capability to distinguish two close targets with\n\ndifferent slant or ground range coordinates. Moreover, slow time resolution derives\n\nfrom platform velocity and leads to the well known concept of azimuth, or along-\n\ntrack resolution. If a bistatic SAR is considered, in which the transmitter and the\n\nreceiver fly along parallel tracks with same altitude and velocity, attaining\n\nin-plane observation with no-squint angle, a similar principle holds. Indeed,\n\nunder above hypotheses a straightforward computation of bistatic SAR resolution\n\nis possible because targets are focused in the range elevation plane common to the\n\ntransmitter and the receiver [8], so range and azimuth directions are well defined\n\nand form a right angle. In this case ground range and azimuth resolutions are\n\nDrg Bistj \u00bc c\nW sinYTx \u00fe sinYRx\u00f0 \u00de (1.2)\n\nDa Bistj \u00bc lTx RRx\nRRx \u00fe RTx (1.3)\n\nwhere c is the velocity of light, W is the chirp bandwidth, lTx is the transmitting\nantenna length, and the receiver incidence angle must be considered negative when\n\nin opposite side geometry. According to these relations, bistatic resolutions can be\n\neasily expressed as a function of the corresponding monostatic ones\n\nDrg Bistj \u00bc 2 sinYTx\nsinYTx \u00fe sinYRx Drg Monoj (1.4)\n\nDa Bistj \u00bc 2RRx\nRRx \u00fe RTx Da Monoj (1.5)\n\nFigures 1.6 and 1.7 report the ratios between monostatic and bistatic resolutions\n\naccording to (1.4) and (1.5). Specifically, the computation of azimuth resolution\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 13\n\n\n\nratios involves the utilization of sensor altitude to compute transmitter and receiver\n\nslant ranges: a value of 450 km is considered herein, even though the variation of\n\nsensor altitude has a negligible effect on azimuth resolution ratios when dealing\n\nwith LEO formations.\n\nOn the basis of the plotted ratios, some important considerations can be stated:\n\n\u2022 In-plane same side geometries with transmitter closer to the target (?Rx > ?Tx)\nimprove bistatic ground range resolution with respect to monostatic one;\n\nFig. 1.6 Ratio of bistatic and monostatic ground range resolution for in-plane, parallel-track,\n\nsame altitude and same velocity configuration\n\nFig. 1.7 Ratio of bistatic and monostatic azimuth resolution for in-plane, parallel-track, same\n\naltitude and same velocity configuration\n\n14 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\n\u2022 If the receiver is closer to the target (?Rx < ?Tx), or opposite side geometry is\nconsidered, degraded bistatic ground range resolution is achieved;\n\n\u2022 If the specular observation condition is met there is slant range ambiguity and\n\nbistatic ground range resolution diverges;\n\n\u2022 The variation of the bistatic azimuth resolution is generally more limited and\n\nbetter performance then monostatic one is obtained if the receiver is closer than\n\ntransmitter to the target, both in same-side and opposite-side geometry.\n\nFor bistatic SARs characterized by arbitrary geometric configurations, however,\n\nthe way fast and slow time resolutions translate in different detected ground areas is\n\nnot trivial. The resolution in each possible direction can be determined, in general,\n\nby computing the width of impulse response (or point spread function) along this\n\nparticular direction in the focused image. This computation is complex and time-\n\nconsuming and this approach does not allow for general and direct equations to be\n\nderived regulating the behavior of image resolutions in any observation geometry.\n\nApproximate solutions for the width of the point spread function along some\n\nremarkable directions can be derived by the so-called gradient method [21\u201323].\n\nThe method starts from the following two considerations:\n\n\u2022 In bistatic SAR neither range nor azimuth direction strictly exists;\n\n\u2022 Image pixels can be interpreted as generated by intersecting \u201ciso-time delay\u201d\n\nand \u201ciso-Doppler\u201d lines.\n\nOn this basis the method proposes to keep the terms range and Doppler\n\nresolutions as the minimum ground distance associated to the change of round\n\ntrip delay and Doppler frequency, respectively. The direction of the gradient of time\n\ndelay represents the direction which maximizes the change in time delay so it\n\nindividuates the direction of best fast time resolution. The same applies to the\n\ndirection of the gradient of Doppler frequency identifying the direction of the best\n\nDoppler resolution. Since the capability to distinguish close targets in the fast time\n\nis in inverse relation with transmitted signal bandwidth, the ground range resolution\n\ncan be expressed as\n\nDr\n?!\n\ng \u00bc 1\nW rt?!g??? ???~itg (1.6)\n\nwhere rt?!g is the ground projection of the gradient of time delay, and~itg is the unit\nvector in the direction of rt?!g. Moreover, the capability to distinguish close targets\nin the slow time is in inverse relation with the coherent integration time, T, that is\nsynthetic aperture duration, so the gradient method estimates Doppler resolution as\n\nDa\n?! \u00bc 1\n\nT rf?!\ng\n\n??? ???~ifg (1.7)\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 15\n\n\n\nwhere rf?!\ng\nis the ground projection of the gradient of Doppler frequency and ~ifg is\n\nits unit vector. According to the definition of gradient the unit vectors~itg and~ifgare\nlocally perpendicular to iso range and iso-Doppler lines, respectively. If the follow-\n\ning hypotheses are assumed:\n\n\u2022 Both transmitter and receiver fly linear path at constant velocity within the\n\ncoherent integration time\n\n\u2022 The Earth is flat within the image area\n\nwith reference to the notation introduced in Fig. 1.3, the gradients of time delay and\n\nDoppler frequencies can be expressed as\n\nrt?! \u00bc 1\nc\n\n~RTx\nRTx\n\n\u00fe\n~RRx\nRRx\n\n !\n\u00bc 1\n\nc\n~iTx \u00fe~iRx\n? ?\n\n(1.8)\n\nrf?! \u00bc 1\nl\n\n1\n\nRTx\n~VTx ? ~VTx ?~iTx\n\n? ?\n~iTx\n\n? ?\u00fe 1\nRRx\n\n~VRx ? ~VRx ?~iRx\n? ?\n\n~iRx\n? ?? ?\n\n(1.9)\n\nwith\n\n~RTx \u00bc ~PTx ?~r ~RRx \u00bc ~PRx ?~r\n\nFrom (1.6) and (1.8) and according to Fig. 1.3, the ground range resolution can\n\nbe rewritten as [22]\n\nDr\n?!\n\ng \u00bc c\nW\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nsin2YTx \u00fe sin2YRx \u00fe 2 sinYTx sinYRx cosF\n\np ~itg (1.10)\nwith\n\n~itg \u00bc\n\nsinYTx cosF\u00fe sinYRxffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nsin2YTx \u00fe sin2YRx \u00fe 2 sinYTx sinYRx cosF\n\np\nsinYTx sinFffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\nsin2YTx \u00fe sin2YRx \u00fe 2 sinYTx sinYRx cosF\np\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775 (1.11)\n\nwhich show that the gradient of time delay points towards the bisector of the bistatic\n\nangle, so the ground range direction is always along the ground projection of this\n\nbisector. Again, as expected, if the receiver is along the specular direction of\n\nthe transmitted signal (? = 180?, ?Tx = ?Rx) ground range resolution diverges. In\nthis case the bisector of the bistatic angle is normal to the ground plane and this\n\nmeans that the gradient of time delay has no component onto the local horizontal\n\nplane. As far as the Doppler direction ~ifg is concerned, it is determined by the\nrelative position, velocity and geometry among transmitter, target and receiver, so\n\n16 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nonly for particular bistatic SAR configurations the direction of ~ifg can be easily\nrelated to system dynamics. For example, in the particular case of parallel-track,\n\nsame-velocity, in plane observation Doppler direction is parallel to the velocity\n\nvectors and therefore orthogonal to the ground-range direction; further notable\n\nconfigurations exist and some of them will be analyzed in the following subsection.\n\nAccording to the gradient method, both ground range and Doppler resolutions\n\nare completely defined in vectorial form and, in general, ground-range and Doppler\n\ndirections are not perpendicular. Pixel skewing therefore arises from bistatic obser-\n\nvation (see Fig. 1.8). Minimum pixel area is achieved if ground-range and Doppler\n\ndirections are orthogonal, so the degradation with respect to this condition can be\n\naccounted for by defining the ? angle that is the angle between iso-range and iso-\nDoppler lines\n\nO \u00bc cos?1 ~itg ?~ifg\n? ?\n\n(1.12)\n\nEquation 1.12 states that bistatic geometries exist in which ground range and\n\nDoppler resolutions are good but imaging capabilities can be very poor. In fact, if?\n\nFig. 1.8 Illustration of pixel skewing effect in monostatic (a) and bistatic (b)\u2013(c) SAR\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 17\n\n\n\napproaches zero or ? the lines of constant time delay are locally parallel to the lines of\nconstant Doppler. Hence, the?-angle assumes the form of an essential parameter that\nmust be used, together with ground range and Doppler resolution, to characterize\n\ngeometric imaging performance of bistatic SAR.\n\nThe above considerations put in evidence that the gradient method is\n\ncharacterized by the capability to cover in a simple and direct way the general\n\nbistatic geometry. However, for completeness it is important to remark that, in\n\norder to derive the gradients in (1.6) and (1.7), a definite time instant has to be\n\nindividuated within the coherent integration time. Transmitter and receiver\n\npositions and velocities at this time must be considered to compute the gradients.\n\nThis means that the method implicitly neglects the variations of the gradient within\n\nthe synthetic aperture. However, as shown in Ref. [22], this variation is negligible,\n\nunless very long synthetic antennae are generated, leading to significant variations\n\nin target aspect angles within the synthetic aperture. In that case different\n\napproaches must be utilized [24].\n\nThe following subsections reports a series of examples to point out how different\n\nrelative positions and velocities contribute to geometric resolutions. The constant\n\ngradient hypothesis is valid for those examples and therefore the gradient method\n\nis utilized with positions and velocities computed halfway through integration\n\ntime [22].\n\n1.3.1.1 Example: LEO-LEO Bistatic SAR\n\nA bistatic SAR is considered herein in which LEO orbits are selected for both\n\ntransmitter and receiver. In this framework, it is reasonable to state that formation\n\nflying satellites are utilized. The simplest example of satellite formation is the one\n\nin which transmitter and receiver fly along the same quasi-polar orbit with a slight\n\ndifference in true anomaly, thus establishing a leader-follower formation in our\n\nEarth-fixed reference frame. From a theoretical point of view, this case is very\n\ninteresting, since it can avoid pixel skewing effects even if it is an out-of-plane\n\nconfiguration (? ? 0), as it will be shown in the following. Actually, according to\nFig. 1.9a, a leader-follower formation can be considered in which both transmitter\n\nand receiver implement a slightly squinted observation, pointing their antennas\n\ntowards the ground area that is seen at boresight by an equivalent monostatic sensor\n\nplaced in the midpoint of the baseline.\n\nIndeed, in this case, the bisector of the bistatic vector and the ground projection\n\nof fast time gradient are directed along the x-axis. Moreover, as far as the Doppler\n\ngradient is concerned, the following relations hold\n\n~VTx \u00bc ~VTx \u00bc ~V RTx \u00bc RRx \u00bc R\n~V ?~iTx\n? ? \u00bc ? ~V ?~iRx? ?\n\n18 A. Moccia and A.

In order to point out\nthis effect the case illustrated in Fig. 1.9b can be taken as a reference, in which two\n\nLEO satellites at the same orbital altitude are separated both in along-track and\n\ncross-track coordinates. In addition, the transmitter is assumed to be a side-looking\n\nsystem (actually also a monostatic sensor adopted as a reference), whereas the\n\nbistatic receiver is able to gather data from arbitrary directions. As illustrated in\n\nFig. 1.9b, the angle ? is introduced to simulate different along-track and cross-track\nbaseline components. Specifically, varying ? from zero to 2? the receiver position\nis on a circle around the transmitter with radius given by the baseline modulus.\n\nIn addition, the angle ? is introduced to account for differences in flight direction\nbetween the transmitter and the receiver. It is worth noting that these geometries\n\nrequire more complicated orbit selections, and, in general, offer more limited\n\nbistatic coverage, with respect to the leader-follower scheme.\n\nFig. 1.9 Observation geometry for LEO-LEO bistatic SAR: (a) leader-follower configuration,\n\n(b) generic. Transmitter and receiver operate at the same non-zero z coordinate\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 19\n\n\n\nFigures 1.11 and 1.12 show examples of ground range and Doppler resolutions,\n\nalong with the attained values of ?-angle. Figure 1.11 also shows the\ncorresponding out-of-plane angles. Since baseline is smaller than transmitter slant\n\nFig. 1.10 Ratio of bistatic and monostatic ground range (left) and (right) azimuth resolutions as a\nfunction of the baseline for leader follower LEO formations (450 km altitude and 45? incidence\nangle for the equivalent monostatic sensor)\n\nFig. 1.11 Ground range resolution (left) and out-of-plane angle (right) for the considered LEO-\nLEO bistatic SAR (450 km altitude, 45? transmitter incidence angle, 100 km baseline length,\n100 MHz chirp bandwidth). Monostatic resolution refers to the observation geometry of the\n\ntransmitter\n\n20 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nrange, the variation of the out-of-plane angle with respect to ? is limited, so the\nbistatic ground range resolution is close to the one achievable by the transmitter\n\nwhen working in monostatic mode.\n\nThe behavior of Doppler resolution and?-angle, instead, deserves more attention.\nIndependently from the values of ?, when? approaches 180? Doppler resolution is\ndegraded. Actually in this case receiver velocity is opposite to that of the transmitter\n\nand so the available Doppler bandwidth for slow time compression is very limited.\n\nDoppler resolution in Fig. 1.12 quickly diverges in the regionwithin the contour lines\n\nat 10 m. Similar considerations can be applied to the ?-angle: critical conditions\nare met for? close to 180? and ? close to 90? and 270?, i.e. when large out-of-plane\nangles (up to 10\u201315?) are established thus rotating the bisector of the bistatic angle\nout of the transmitter range elevation plane and closer to Doppler gradient direction.\n\nFinally Figs. 1.13 and 1.14 report examples of iso-range and iso-Doppler contours\n\nfor bad and good observation geometries, respectively. The reported contours are in\n\nfine agreement with the results derived in Figs. 1.11 and 1.12. In particular, Fig. 1.13\n\ndefinitely shows the importance of adequate bistatic geometry even in presence of\n\nexcellent resolutions: when iso-range and iso-Doppler lines are almost parallel any\n\nincrease in chirp bandwidth and coherent integration time has no practical effect on\n\nbistatic performance. Moreover, it is worth noting the 1 s integration time, already\n\nquite large with respect to conventional spaceborne SAR, is possible assuming\n\nsteerable antennas. On the other hand, Fig. 1.14 demonstrates the possibility of\n\nachieving satisfactory results even for non parallel trajectories, thus showing how\n\nformation flying design is strictly related to bistatic SAR.\n\nFig. 1.12 Doppler resolution in meters (left) and O-angle in degrees (right) for the considered\nLEO-LEO bistatic SAR (450 km altitude, 45? transmitter incidence angle, 100 km baseline length,\n1 s coherent integration time)\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 21\n\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Example: LEO Receiver and Higher Altitude Transmitter\n\nHigh altitude transmitters in conjunction with a constellation of LEO receivers have\n\nbeen proposed to achieve a systematic reduction of revisit time [13], especially over\n\nregional areas. Indeed, high altitude satellites, such as MEO or GEO, can access\n\nwide areas easily; at the same time LEO receivers have the twofold advantage of\n\n\u2022 Cutting down the required power in transmission, thanks to the reduction of echo\n\npropagation path with respect to the case of high altitude monostatic or bistatic\n\nSAR;\n\nFig. 1.14 Iso-range (thin) and iso-Doppler (thick) contours for G \u00bc 60? and C \u00bc 60? and F\nffi 10? . In this case O ffi 100? and ground range and Doppler resolution are 2.1 and 1.6 m,\nrespectively\n\nFig. 1.13 Iso-range (thin) and iso-Doppler (thick) contours forG \u00bc 240?,C \u00bc 150? andF ffi ?13?.\nIn this case O ffi 177? and ground range and Doppler resolution are 2.2 and 6.5 m, respectively\n\n22 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\n\u2022 Allowing the system to exploit observation geometries different from the\n\nconventional monostatic side-looking one, such as the forward- or backward-\n\nlooking ones [25, 26].\n\nIf transmitter altitude is higher than 20,000 km and LEO receivers are consid-\n\nered, it results\n\n~VRx\nRRx\n\n>>\n~VTx\nRTx\n\n(1.14)\n\nnamely the velocity-to-slant-range ratio of the receiver is two orders of magnitude\n\nlarger than that of the transmitter. In this case transmitter contribution to Doppler\n\ngradient can be neglected and geometric resolutions can be derived assuming a\n\nquasi-stationary transmitter (~VTx ffi 0). In this case, gradient method equations can\nbe simplified notably. According to the analysis reported in Ref. [22] the following\n\nrelations can be utilized for side-looking and forward-looking receivers\n\nDa \u00bc\n\nlRRx\nVRx\n\n1\n\nT\nside? looking\n\nlRRx\nVRxcos2YRx\n\n1\n\nT\nforward ? looking\n\n8>>><\n>>>: (1.15)\n\nO \u00bc\np? tan?1 ? sinYTx cosF\u00fe sinYRx\n\nsinYTx sinF\n\n? ?????\n???? side? looking\n\np? tan?1 sinYTx sinF\nsinYTx cosF\u00fe sinYRx\n\n? ?????\n???? forward ? looking\n\n8>>><\n>>>: (1.16)\n\nwhere four-quadrant inverse tangent within values [?p, p] must be used to compute\n?-angle. Equation 1.15 states that Doppler resolution is degraded in forward-\nlooking mode, with respect to side-looking mode, by a factor 1=cos2YRx, that is a\nrise from 1 to 4 for receiver incidence angles ranging from 0? to 60?.\n\nFor the sake of a quantitative analysis of image resolutions and ?-angle, the\norbital geometry proposed in Ref. [13] can be taken as a reference (see Fig. 1.15).\n\nIt relies on a GEO transmitter covering European latitudes, so 50? as transmitter\nincidence angle can be assumed. In addition, a constellation of LEO receivers can\n\nbe designed to collect bistatic data from whatever out-of-plane configuration (i.e.?\n2 [0, 360?]) and incidence angle (i.e. ?Rx 2 [0, 60?]), both in side-looking and in\nforward-looking mode.\n\nFigure 1.16 shows an example of ground range and Doppler resolutions, while\n\nFig. 1.17 reports the relevant ?-angle for both side and forward-looking receivers.\nDue to the symmetry of the problem, the analysis is limited to ? 2 [0, 180?].\nAs expected ground range resolution (that is the same for either side- or forward-\n\nlooking receivers) is greatly affected by the out-of-plane angle, with the worst value\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 23\n\n\n\nattained for opposite-side geometry.With reference to Doppler resolution, assuming\n\na constant integration time, an increase of off-nadir angle determines a decrease of\n\nDoppler bandwidth, more relevant in forward-looking geometry.\n\nAs far as the ?-angle is concerned, for forward-looking receivers in-plane\nobservation is not enabled because in this case iso-range and iso-Doppler lines\n\nare locally parallel. Indeed, for forward-looking receiver with stationary transmitter\n\nthe gradient of Doppler frequency is aligned to receiver velocity, but the latter is\n\nalso parallel to the gradient of time delay on the ground, because receiver velocity\n\nis in the common range elevation plane. Better performance is obtained for out-of-\n\nplane observations, in which the direction of the gradient of time delay on the\n\nground is out of the receiver range elevation plane. Opposite observations apply to\n\nFig. 1.15 Illustration of GEO-LEO bistatic SAR\n\nFig. 1.16 Ground range contours in meters (left) and Doppler resolution (right) for the considered\nGEO-LEO bistatic SAR (450 km receiver altitude, 100 MHz chirp bandwidth and 1 s coherent\n\nintegration time)\n\n24 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nside-looking receiver. In this case better values of ? are, in general, obtained, with\nthe sole exception of strong out-of-plane geometry (? close to 90?).\n\nThe outlined behavior for a forward-looking receiver is a direct consequence of\n\nintrinsically ambiguous geometry. Actually, left/right ambiguity arises from\n\nmonostatic forward-looking geometry [26] and therefore the ambiguity can be\n\nremoved in the bistatic case only if the transmitter is able to rotate iso-range and/\n\nor iso-Doppler lines [22, 25, 26]. On the contrary, side-looking SAR geometry is\n\nunambiguous thus justifying the limited level of resulting bad values for the ?-\nangle in Fig. 1.17 (left).\n\n1.3.2 Radiometric Resolution and Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n\nRadiometric resolution can be defined as the minimum brightness contrast necessary\n\nfor discrimination of two targets. This definition, anyway, cannot be expressed in\n\nquantitative form as a function of the main SAR system parameters unless specific\n\nSAR imaging models have been introduced.\n\nThe received radar signal is typically represented as the coherent addition of all\n\nthe contributions of the individual scatterers, so each pixel in SAR images can be\n\ninterpreted as the phasor resulting from the focused returns of the individual\n\nscatterers within the resolution cell [4]. This coherent addition from many scatterers\n\ngives rise to a phenomenon called speckle [5] which is typical of radar or laser\n\nscattering and is caused by surface roughness when comparable to wavelength.\n\nThe main effect of speckle phenomenon on SAR imaging is that radar response\n\nexhibits a statistical behavior and therefore the amplitude and phase of the focused\n\nSAR images have to be interpreted as random variables. This means that, in general,\n\nFig. 1.17 O-angle in degrees for the considered GEO-LEO bistatic SAR with side-looking (left)\nand forward-looking (right) receivers\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 25\n\n\n\nif homogeneous areas are observed by SAR, the statistical distribution of amplitude\n\nand phase will result in intensity image variations, indicated as speckle-noise over\n\nthe observed area. As a consequence, there is no possibility to characterize radio-\n\nmetric aspects of a SAR target by measurements of one pixel only [27]. According\n\nto this statistical approach, radiometric resolution has to account for the possibility\n\nto consider two areas, with two different speckles, as different [27]; radiometric\n\nresolution can be therefore quantified comparing the mean intensity value (the echo\n\npower per unit area), ?, and the closest mean value that can be recognized, in\nstatistical sense, as different, namely ?+s, where s is the standard deviation of the\nimage intensity. As dB scale is generally adopted, radiometric resolution can be\n\nfinally expresses as\n\ng \u00bc 10 log 1\u00fe s\nm\n\n? ?\n(1.17)\n\nFrom(1.17) it is immediate to understand why multi-look techniques [6] can be\n\nutilized to improve radiometric resolution. Actually, if NL looks are utilized to\ngenerate SAR image, more samples are collected thus reducing the standard\n\ndeviation by a factor\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\nNL\n\np\n, without affecting significantly the mean.\n\nThe standard deviation s includes two independent contributions, namely the\nvariation due to speckle and that due to thermal noise [5, 6]\n\ng \u00bc 10 log 1\u00fe sspeckle\nm\n\n\u00fe snoise\nm\n\n? ?\n(1.18)\n\nFor the sake of quantifying those ratios, a statistical distribution for pixel\n\namplitude and phase must be introduced. As common in monostatic SAR, for\n\nuniformly distributed phase and Rayleigh distributed amplitudes, an exponential\n\ndistribution [5] can be derived for image intensity, so that (1.17) becomes\n\ng \u00bc 10 log 1\u00fe 1ffiffiffiffiffiffi\nNL\n\np 1\u00fe 1\nSNR\n\n? ?? ?\n(1.19)\n\nthat is the widespread relation utilized to compute radiometric resolution in SAR\n\nimaging. As expected, if both SNR and NL tend to infinity (noiseless data), the\nradiometric resolution tends to 0 dB. Typical radiometric resolution requirements\n\nspan from 0.5 to 4 dB depending on the application. Figure 1.18 reports an example\n\nof radiometric resolution versus the scattering coefficient for different numbers of\n\nlooks. If SNR is 0 dB and one look is considered the expected radiometric resolu-\n\ntion is 4.77 dB, that means a difference in mean echo intensity of this order is\n\nrequired to discriminate between extended areas. Multi-looking represents a valu-\n\nable solution to improve radiometric resolution, however a trade-off must be\n\nfound because with the increasing number of looks geometric resolution degrades\n\naccordingly [5, 6].\n\n26 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nThe actual evaluation of ? involves the determination of the signal-to-noise ratio\nand therefore the introduction of bistatic SAR equation. To this end different\n\nexpressions have been proposed [5, 28, 29] to put in evidence more conveniently\n\ncontributions of various parameters. Slight modifications to the formulations pro-\n\nposed in Refs. [28, 29] lead to the following\n\nSNR \u00bc POWTxl\n2GTxGRxs0bTdcDrgDa cosF\n\n4p\u00f0 \u00de3R2TxR2RxkBTnoiseFnoise\n(1.20)\n\nwith POWTx transmitted power, GTx transmitting antenna gain, GRx receiving\nantenna gain, s0b bistatic scattering coefficient, dc duty cycle, kB Boltzmann\u2019s\nconstant, Tnoise receiver noise temperature, Fnoise receiver noise figure.\n\nMost of the introduced parameters are commonly utilized to define monostatic\n\nSAR performance. In bistatic SAR, however, some remarks have to be made.\n\n\u2022 The behavior of the scattering coefficient in bistatic SAR geometry is more\n\ncomplex than in the monostatic case. An established database for bistatic\n\nscattering of both natural scenes and artificial targets is not available at the\n\npresent day. The main database for ground and sea scattering concerns X-band\n\nmicrowave measurements [30], and was acquired during the 1960s. According\n\nto that work, the main findings are that the backscattering coefficient approaches\n\na minimum for strong out-of-plane geometries (i.e. ? close to 90? or 270?) with\nvalues 10\u201320 dB below the monostatic value. In addition, out-of-plane values\n\nare not significantly different from in-plane ones for out-of-plane angles within\n\n10? from the opposite side direction and within 40? from the same-side one, that\nis angles close to in-plane observation.\n\nFig. 1.18 Variation of\n\nradiometric resolution\n\nwith scattering coefficient\n\nand number of looks\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 27\n\n\n\n\u2022 Duty cycle is defined as the ratio between the length of the transmitter pulse and\n\nthe pulse repetition interval. In monostatic SAR, with co-located transmitters\n\nand receivers, quite limited duty cycles (lower than 0.2) must be usually adopted\n\nto avoid ambiguities. In bistatic SAR, instead, no limitation is, in principle, set to\n\nthe duty cycle: large values can be therefore exploited, including the case of\n\ncontinuous transmission and reception (dc = 1) [28].\n\u2022 A few parameters in (1.20) strictly depend on the transmitter, specifically\n\nPOWTx, RTx, and GTx; their contribution in radar equation represents the power\nflux density near Earth surface\n\nrPOW \u00bc\nPOWTxGTx\n\n4p\u00f0 \u00de3R2Tx\n(1.21)\n\nand it is an important issue particularly when illuminators of opportunity are\n\nconsidered, as in Ref. [28]. Indeed, rPOW can be used to make a comparison\namong different available illuminators.\n\n1.3.3 Timing, Pointing and Synchronization\n\nThe availability of accurate time reference is essential in SAR imaging. When\n\nmonostatic observation is implemented ultra-stable local oscillators are used to\n\ndefine radar time unit. This unit sets references for pulse duration, modulation and\n\ndemodulation, and controls the alternation of transmitting and receiving modes.\n\nIn bistatic SAR two separated systems are utilized for transmission and reception\n\nso some kind of synchronization must be used. In general, synchronization problem\n\ncan be tackled at different levels because different types of synchronization may be\n\nnecessary depending on the considered bistatic SAR geometry and configuration.\n\nThe problem can be schematized in three different tasks: footprint matching,\nwindowing design and time and phase (or frequency) referencing.\n\n1.3.3.1 Footprint Matching\n\nFootprint matching deals with the problem of illuminating the target area by the\n\ntransmitter and of pointing the main lobe of the receiving antenna toward the\n\nsame ground area. The pointing accuracy requirements and the relevant perfor-\n\nmance strictly depend on the intended implementation. Specifically, if LEO-LEO\n\nbistatic SAR is considered, the problem can bemore challenging because transmitter\n\nand receiver orbit with similar velocity and also footprint dimensions with similar\n\norder of magnitude are expected. A strategy is presented in Ref. [31] to guarantee\n\nfootprint matching for LEO pendulum formations. The strategy involves the\n\n28 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\ncoordinate use of electronically steerable SAR antennas and attitude maneuvers to\n\nsuperimpose transmitter and receiver footprints at different observed latitudes along\n\nsatellites orbit. In order to avoid residual gaps depending on attitude errors receiver\n\nfootprint was assumed slightly larger than the illuminated area.\n\nIn the case of LEO receivers and higher altitude transmitters, instead, the\n\nfootprint matching problem can take advantage of the altitude difference between\n\ntransmitter and receiver. Transmitter is slower and generally designed to cover\n\nlarge areas, receiver pointing requirements therefore resemble the monostatic case.\n\n1.3.3.2 Windowing Design\n\nWindowing design is in charge of assuring that the opening of the receiving channel\n\nfollows the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the transmitter. PRF selection in\n\nbistatic SAR is conceptually similar to the monostatic case, that is the optimal PRF\n\nhas to be computed accounting for proper sampling of Doppler bandwidth and\n\navoiding SAR ambiguities [4\u20136]. Within the framework of the start-and-stop\n\napproximation, PRF selection is primarily dictated by the need to avoid range and\n\nfrequency aliasing in the range-Doppler image. Range aliasing occurs when the\n\npulse repetition frequency is so high that several pulses illuminate different parts\n\nof the scene at the same time: this condition establish the maximum value of\n\nPRF. Moreover, according to the Nyquist\u2019s sampling criterion, a lower bound on\n\nthe pulse repetition frequency is established by the Doppler bandwidth of the\n\nilluminated area. In bistatic SAR the Doppler bandwidth, to a first order, is\n\nBD ~r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1l\n~VTx ?\n\n~RTx\nT\n2\n\n? ?\n~RTx\n\nT\n2\n\n? ??? ??? ~RTx ?\nT\n2\n\n? ?\n~RTx ?

T2\n? ??? ??\n\n !\" #\n\n(1.21)\n\nthat is the Doppler bandwidth is determined by the first and last positions from\n\nwhich the target is seen by both radar antennas. Bistatic SAR scenario, however,\n\nfeatures two main differences with respect to the monostatic counterpart:\n\n\u2022 Transmitter and receiver are physically separated, so, if convenient, the system\n\ncan operate in CW mode, that is the transmitted frequency modulated signal is\n\ncontinuous and the receiver samples the scattered signal continuously. In such a\n\nmode the concept of PRF is lost. However, range and Doppler focusing have to\n\nbe performed for SAR imaging. As range focusing is the cross-correlation of the\n\nscattered echo with a copy of the transmitted signal, the CW bistatic SAR can\n\nbe assimilated to a usual pulsed SAR system by introducing a stop length\n\n[28, 32]. This length is the time duration of the window used for range cross-\n\ncorrelation. In such way, even if CWmode is considered, the equivalent PRF can\n\nbe introduced as the inverse of the stop length. Range compressed data\n\nfrom subsequent time windows can be then focused in azimuth by conventional\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 29\n\n\n\nSAR processing. The time window has to be set: (a) allowing the system to\n\nbe considered working in start stop fashion; (b) achieving a non-ambiguous\n\nequivalent PRF (i.e. equivalent PRF higher than processed Doppler bandwidth).\n\nFinally it is worth noting that a bistatic SAR can also operate in a partially CW\n\nmode, that is the transmitter is a pulsed radar and the receiver performs continu-\n\nous data acquisition. Obviously, in this case, transmitting PRF has to be tuned to\n\nthe Doppler bandwidth of bistatic data.\n\n\u2022 SAR image ambiguities are conventionally interpreted in range and azimuth\n\ndomains [6], that is ghosts in SAR images are generated in range or azimuth\n\ncoordinates when, respectively, echoes from proceeding and succeeding pulses\n\narrives back at the antenna simultaneously with the desired one or Doppler\n\nspectrum is contaminated by ambiguous signals from antenna azimuth side-\n\nlobes. In bistatic SAR range and azimuth ambiguities survive both in fast and\n\nslow time domains, and the location of the relevant ghost targets in the final\n\nimage depends on the relative geometry among transmitter, target, and receiver,\n\nas observed in Sect. 1.3.1 when directions of the gradient of time delay and\n\nDoppler frequency were introduced.\n\n1.3.3.3 Time Referencing\n\nThe definition of a common time reference between transmitter and receiver affects\n\nbistatic SAR performance at different levels, although the most stringent require-\n\nments on time synchronization are set by the need for accurate slant range\n\nmeasurements. A timing accuracy, ?t, of the order of a fraction of the compressed\npulse width is a typical requirement [30]. If this constraint cannot be satisfied by the\n\nultra-stable clock embarked on the receiver, a reference signal that periodically\n\nmatches receiver clock with transmitter one must be provided. The reference signal\n\ncan be generated either by the transmitter or by external sources (such as GPS)\n\ndepending on the required accuracy. For this type of time synchronization the\n\nreceiver clock stability, q, can be expressed as [30]\n\nq \u00bc Dt\n2Tup\n\n(1.23)\n\nwhere Tup is the adopted clock update interval.\nPhase (or frequency) synchronization issues set additional, and typically tighter,\n\nconstrains on time referencing accuracy and oscillator stability. In bistatic SAR,\n\nindeed, low frequency phase errors do not cancel out when the received signal is\n\ndemodulated because the signal had been previously modulated by the transmitter\n\nwith a different oscillator characterized, in general, by different low frequency\n\nphase errors [24, 33]. It is worth noting that those errors do not affect monostatic\n\nSAR that uses the same oscillator for either modulation or demodulation.\n\n30 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nLow frequency phase errors can have strong impacts on bistatic SAR imaging,\n\nreducing image quality notably. Indeed, as showed in Refs. [24, 33]:\n\n\u2022 A constant oscillator frequency offset (linear phase errors) between transmitter\n\nand receiver leads to a displacement both in range and in azimuth of the peak of\n\nthe impulse response;\n\n\u2022 A linear oscillator frequency drift (quadratic phase errors) generates a widening\n\nand a degradation of impulse response in Doppler direction. If a reference signal\n\nis exploited by receiver oscillator, phase stability is required over the coherent\n\nintegration time, T, and the required phase error, ?f, has to be lower than 90?\n\n[30], thus leading to the following required stability for receiver oscillator\n\nq \u00bc lDf\n2pcT\n\n(1.24)\n\n\u2022 Random oscillator phase noise degrades all the image parameters, especially\n\nintegrated side-lobe ratio (ISLR).\n\nSpecial conditions exist in which phase synchronization requirements can be\n\nrelaxed. Indeed, as experiences in Ref. [34] if the duration of the bistatic acquisition\n\nis short (few seconds at most) and high quality crystal oscillators are used, only a\n\nconstant offset of carrier in carrier frequency has to be expected. The offset can be\n\nestimated from bistatic raw data and then removed.\n\n1.4 From Ideas to Proof of Concepts\n\nNon-systematic bistatic measurements from spacecraft have been conducted so far,\n\nin particular considering synthetic aperture radar. Actually bistatic observation has\n\nbeen mainly applied by using one or both Earth-fixed antennae and with reference\n\nto targets of limited dimensions. This situation can be explained considering\n\ndifficulties in bistatic SAR previously outlined. Furthermore, even if very\n\npromising applications of bistatic SAR are known from a long time, only the\n\nbasic principles of such applications have been investigated and achievable perfor-\n\nmance have been characterized only qualitatively. As a result it has been difficult to\n\nassess possible roles of bistatic SAR within the framework of satellite remote\n\nsensing, and to define and develop operative bistatic systems. The transition from\n\nthose ideas to proof of concepts, anyway, is being currently carried out.\nThis section illustrates some stages in the development of bistatic systems, from\n\nthe beginning theoretical speculations and the first experimentations to the most\n\nrecent and important results, with more emphasis on space based investigations and\n\nscientific applications.\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 31\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Bistatic Radar\n\nAtmospheric studies by Earth-based bistatic radar measurements represented one of\n\nthe first area of research [35] together with oceanographic applications [36].\n\nSpecifically, the observability of clear air winds by Bragg bistatic scattering from\n\nelectromagnetic refractive turbulence index at short wavelength was put in evi-\n\ndence in Ref. [37], whereas the peculiarities of bistatic radar equation for detecting\n\nmeteorological targets, such as raindrops and refractivity perturbations, were\n\nanalyzed in Ref. [38]. In addition, the results of Doppler frequency maps from\n\nLoran-A transmissions and a ground-based receiver have been presented in Ref.\n\n[36], showing the possibility of tracking anisotropies of ocean-wave spectra and\n\ntherefore identifying sea wave lengths and directions; the experiment also\n\nrepresented one of the first examples of adoption of illuminators of opportunity.\n\nMore recently, networks of bistatic dual- and multiple Doppler weather radars have\n\nbeen proposed for obtaining vector winds [39].\n\nAn example of fully spaceborne bistatic radar experiment was presented in Ref.\n\n[40]. The L-band telecommunication link of Mir orbital station was used as\n\ntransmitter and the reflected signals from the Earth were received from a geosyn-\n\nchronous satellite. This experiment represented the first example of bistatic\n\nradiolocation of the Earth from space and the collected data were also exploited\n\nfor atmospheric investigations, such as the estimation of absorption coefficients due\n\nto atmospheric oxygen at L-band.\n\nPlanetary studies have also taken advantage of bistatic radar measurements.\n\nDifferent configurations were implemented, e.g. satellite-based transmitter and\n\nEarth-based receiver [41\u201344] or planet-based transmitter and satellite-based\n\nreceiver [45]. Proposed and partially experimented planetary applications include:\n\n\u2022 Topography, reflectivity, surface scattering, dielectric constant, rms surface\n\nslopes, surface texture and density on Moon, Mars and Venus;\n\n\u2022 Remote probing in regions and under conditions not obtainable with Earth-based\n\nsystems.\n\nRenewed impulse to the bistatic research and the growth of bistatic techniques\n\nwas given around year 2000 by the diffuse utilization of illuminators of opportunity\n\n[2] and specifically by the application of this concept to Global Navigation Satellite\n\nSystem (GNSS) constellations. Actually, thanks to the intrinsic characteristics of\n\nGNSSs some well-known limitations of illuminators of opportunity can be over-\n\ncome. Specifically, continuous (both in space and time) transmissions can be\n\nutilized, with well-known and stable characteristics, accurate knowledge of illumi-\n\nnator position and velocity, and signal modulation and coding adequate for range-\n\nDoppler processing. Available signal power, non-selectable transmitter carrier\n\nfrequency, bandwidth and polarization, however, still remain important issues\n\nthat can have an impact on resolution, signal to noise ratio and signal processing,\n\nthus affecting potential applications. Investigated and experimented applications\n\ndeal with the measurement of GPS reflected signals for estimation of sea-state and\n\n32 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nwind speed [46\u201348], for rough surface characterization [49, 50], and moving target\n\ndetection, such as aircrafts approaching a runway [51]. Most of the experimen-\n\ntations relied on ground-based receivers, mounted, for instance, on the edge of a\n\nbridge [48] or on instrumented towers [50]. However, since the first demonstration\n\nof the possibility of gathering Earth-reflected GPS signals from LEO orbits [52], the\n\ninterest on spaceborne bistatic LEO receivers for large scale observation has been\n\nincreasing. A few years later, indeed, the first experimental payload flew onboard\n\nUK-DMS satellite [53], showing the possibility of processing C/A codes of GPS\n\nreflected signals from oceans to obtain delay Doppler distributions. Finally, a\n\nbistatic orbital demonstrator was developed by the European Space Agency\n\n(ESA) [54], able to use the full bandwidth of GNSS reflected signals for high\n\nresolution ocean altimetry as primary objective, but potentially also for\n\nscatterometry, ice altimetry, soil moisture and biomass evaluation.\n\n1.4.2 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar\n\nThe research conducted by Stanford University and Scripps Institution of Ocean-\n\nography in the mid-1970s led to the first documented experiments of synthetic\n\naperture radar in bistatic geometry [55, 56]. Two different bistatic configurations\n\nwere implemented. The first experiment [55] utilized LORAN-A 1.95 MHz navi-\n\ngation facility as transmitting source, whereas the receiver was mounted in a step\n\nvan which was driven at uniform velocity along available aircraft taxiways, ramps\n\nand roads. Radar signals backscattered from sea surface were coherently processed.\n\nDue to the extremely long wavelength of LORAN-A, very long synthetic aperture\n\nwere realized, ranging from 0.8 to 2.7 km, to achieve satisfactory angular resolu-\n\ntion. In addition sequential observations on nearly orthogonal headings, separated\n\nonly a few minutes in time, were used to provide multidirectional high resolution\n\nmeasures of the ocean wave spectrum. The second experimental campaign, instead,\n\nwas carried out using a ship-borne bistatic radar [56]. The transmitting antenna was\n\nsuspended from the ship\u2019s mast with the receiving one mounted near the bow about\n\n25 m from the transmitting antenna. Both antennas pointed ocean surface. The\n\nmotion of the ship was used to synthesize an approximately 350 m long aperture\n\nand measurements were made at four frequencies ranging from 4 to 21 MHz.\n\nAbout 10 years later the first airborne bistatic SAR surveys were conducted by\n\nEnvironmental Research Institute of Michigan [57]. Two airborne X-band SARs\n\nflying with programmed separations along parallel trajectories were used to imple-\n\nment bistatic observations at three bistatic angles (2?, 40?, and 80?). In particular\nthe collected data showed a reduction of about 10\u201320 dB in the dynamic range of\n\nthe bistatic images with respect to the monostatic ones, due to reduced retro-\n\nreflector effects in build-up areas. These experiments clearly put in evidence\n\nsome basic issues of bistatic SAR implementations, such as time and phase syn-\n\nchronization or antenna footprint matching, but also bistatic SAR focusing\n\napproaches and performance.\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 33\n\n\n\nIn the first 1990s a more challenging bistatic SAR configuration was success-\n\nfully implemented by NASA JPL [58]. Bistatic SAR images were generated using\n\nC-Band ERS-1 satellite as illuminator and NASA DC-8 aircraft as receiver. Due to\n\nthe extreme differences in transmitter and receiver velocities, bistatic data collec-\n\ntion occurred in a brief burst of signals as the spacecraft overflew the aircraft. Even\n\nif only 3 s data acquisition was performed, it was observed that this time span was\n\ntoo long for the two frequency standards to remain coherent, and therefore\n\nthe chirps directly received from the satellite, recorded along with their echoes,\n\nwere used as coherent reference for bistatic SAR processing. Similar experiments\n\nwere also conducted using SIR-C as transmitter [59].\n\nDuring the last decade research in bistatic SAR has been intensified and important\n\nexperimental campaigns were conducted in several countries by means of different\n\nrealizations, namely the transmitter was spaceborne or airborne and the receiver\n\nairborne or ground-based. Table 1.1 lists the main bistatic SAR experiments carried-\n\nout from year 2000.\n\nWith reference to configurations with airborne illuminator and fixed receiver,\n\ntwo experiments can be mentioned [60, 61]. In May 2004, a bistatic field test was\n\nperformed by FGAN (Forschungsgesellschaft fu?r Angewandte Naturwis-\n\nsenschaften, Research Establishment for Applied Science) [60]: MEMPHIS radar,\n\noperating in mm-wave range and installed on a Transall C-160, was utilized as\n\ntransmitter, and the receiver unit was mounted on the roof-deck of a building nearby\n\nthe scene. Same side geometry was implemented, with both side-looking and\n\nsquinted transmitter (0\u201340? squint angle). The scene prepared for the field test\nincluded different types of targets: a fence, four spheres, one corner reflector and\n\ntwo military transport vehicles. Thanks to the 200 MHz bandwidth transmitted\n\nsignal, 75 cm range resolution was achieved. Furthermore, a decrease of the cross-\n\nrange resolution caused by the decreasing effective synthetic aperture was also\n\nverified.\n\nA second experiment with airborne illuminator and fixed receiver was conducted\n\nby DRDC (Defense Research and Development Canada) in spring 2006 [61].\n\nTable 1.1 Main bistatic SAR experiments conducted from year 2000\n\nConfiguration Institution Country\n\nAirborne illuminator/ground-based receiver FGAN [60] Germany\n\nDRDC [61] Canada\n\nAirborne illuminator/airborne receiver QinetiQ [62] Great Britain\n\nDLR/ONERA [63] Germany\n\nFGAN [64] Germany\n\nSpaceborne illuminator/ground-based receiver Politecnico di Milano [32] Italy\n\nUniv. of Catalun?a [65] Spain\n\nUniv. of Birmingham [66] UK\n\nUniv.

Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nThe research activity aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of a long-range\n\n(>100 km) airborne experimental bistatic SAR for moderate-to-high resolutions\n\n(<1 m). The experimentation utilized the CONVAIR 580 C/X-SAR system as\n\ntransmitter and an ad-hoc developed compact two-channel, wide-band X/C band\n\nmodule as receiver. Rather than using a direct link between transmitter and receiver\n\nto establish phase coherence, DRDC used highly stable \u201cfree-running\u201d crystal\n\noscillators, in order to keep the system simple and to reduce the risk of interception.\n\nDRDC devised an experimental setup to discipline the oscillators to a three-axis set\n\nof accelerometers. The output of the accelerometers was utilized to apply an\n\naccurate correction voltage to the oscillator inputs, which are inversely proportional\n\nto the frequency offset induced by the aircraft motion. Results have shown the\n\npossibility to improve phase noise of more than 20 dB.\n\nA fully airborne, synchronized bistatic SAR demonstration was carried out by\n\nQuinetiQ in September 2002 [62]. The experiment made use of a high transmit\n\npower radar, onboard a BAC1-11, together with a passive X-band receiver mounted\n\non a helicopter. Both platforms operated in spotlight mode, imaging an urban\n\nenvironment surrounded by natural clutter regions. Synchronization was achieved\n\nusing a pair of cesium atomic clocks. Data were recorded at a number of different\n\nimaging geometries, with the aim of investigating the effect of varying bistatic\n\nangle, grazing angle and platform velocity on bistatic imagery. Both mono and\n\nbistatic data were acquired thus highlighting differences in the scattering\n\nmechanisms in the two images. For instance, acquisitions at 70? bistatic angle\nshowed that retro-reflector effects in man-made environment is more relevant in\n\nmonostatic images. Moreover different building structures appear bright in the two\n\nimages: in the bistatic case the sides of the buildings are more visible, whereas in\n\nthe monostatic one roofs appear brighter.\n\nDLR (Deutschland fu?r Luft- und Raumfahrt, German Aerospace Center) and\n\nONERA (Office National d\u2019Etudes et de Recherches Ae?ronautiques, French\n\nNational Aerospace Research Center) organized some joint bistatic airborne\n\nexperiments [63] involving their radar systems E-SAR and RAMSES, respectively.\n\nThese experiments took place between October 2002 and February 2003. Two main\n\ngeometrical configurations were flown. In the first geometrical configuration, an\n\nalong-track baseline of 30 m was established to investigate phase synchronization\n\nissues and single pass interferometry. The second geometrical configuration was\n\ndesigned to acquire images with large bistatic angles. The two planes flew on\n\nparallel tracks around 2 km apart, at about the same altitude, establishing bistatic\n\nangles up to 20?. No communication link was used for synchronization. A two steps\nsolution was, however, adopted to guarantee accurate timing. First, before take-off,\n\nthe two oscillators were connected and their frequencies matched, then just before\n\neach acquisition, the two PRFs were synchronized to the PPS (Pulse-Per-Second)\n\nsignal coming from the GPS. This ensured window synchronization. Finally,\n\nresidual discrepancies between the frequencies of the two oscillators were corrected\n\nin the data processing chain. In all acquisitions, both systems were used also in\n\nreception so that a monostatic image was always acquired for each bistatic image.\n\nMoreover several data takes were acquired for each geometrical configuration, with\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 35\n\n\n\nvarying system parameters, e.g. bandwidth of 50 MHz or 100 MHz, RAMSES\n\ntransmitting or E-SAR transmitting. Images acquired with large bistatic angles put\n\nin evidence the possibility to use bistatic images to characterize natural surfaces and\n\ndiscriminate between different types of land cover.\n\nIn November 2003, also FGAN undertook a fully airborne bistatic flight cam-\n\npaign. The transmitting sensor, AER-II, was placed on a Dornier Do-228 and the\n\nreceiving sensor, PAMIR, on a Transall C-160 [64]. Both SAR sensors operate at\n\nX-band with 300 MHz bandwidth. Parallel track bistatic geometries were\n\nimplemented with tight overlap control of antenna footprints. Several acquisitions\n\nwere carried out with bistatic angles ranging from 13? to 76? to explore the\ninfluence of the bistatic angle on the collected data. No synchronization link was\n\nutilized. The finest ground range resolution was approximately 0.74 m and the\n\nDoppler resolution on the ground was approximately 0.35 m.\n\nAs far as bistatic configurations with spaceborne transmitters and ground-based\n\nreceivers are concerned, a series of bistatic SAR images were generated by\n\nPolitecnico di Milano using a single digital TV channel, 20 MHz bandwidth, of\n\nthe Hotbird-4 geostationary satellite and a fixed ground-based receiver mounted on\n\na small tower [32]. The synthetic aperture was obtained by exploiting the small\n\ndaily motion of the satellite. Range focusing was carried out using the direct signal\n\nreceived by a commercial parabolic antenna as reference. Achieved range and\n\nazimuth resolutions were of the order of 10 m on an area of about 200 ? 200m.\nA bistatic SAR receiver prototype was developed by University of Catalun?a and\n\ntested from September 2005 to January 2006 using Envisat and ERS-2 satellites as\n\nnon cooperative transmitters [65]. The receiver was located on the roof of the Signal\n\nTheory and Communications Department of the University of Catalun?a. The\n\nexperimentation was intended to deploy and synchronize several bistatic fixed\n\nreceiver in order to perform single-pass interferometry. The prototype utilized the\n\ndirect signal to carry-out PRF extraction and chirp and Doppler rates estimation.\n\nThe first bistatic images were produced in December 2005 by sub-aperture\n\nprocessing with integrated topography compensations.\n\nUniversity of Birmingham has been carrying out active research in the area of\n\nSpace-Surface Bistatic SAR (SS-BSAR) since 2003. The main aim of this research\n\nis to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and performance of SS-BSAR,\n\nutilizing GNSS as illuminator of opportunity [66]. The experimental setup includes\n\na moving platform (on a 27 m long track) with a heterodyne antenna pointed\n\ntowards the satellite and a radar antenna pointed towards the observed ground\n\narea. The heterodyne antenna collects the direct GNSS signal that is used for\n\nreflected signal synchronization during bistatic SAR image generation. Experimen-\n\ntal bistatic SAR images were generated using different satellites from GLONASS\n\nconstellation (5 MHz signal bandwidth) and different bistatic angles. Range reso-\n\nlution of 30 m was therefore achieved along with 1.5 m cross-range resolution for\n\nintegration times up to 45 s. In addition, a synchronization scheme based on GNSS\n\nbroadcasted data has been validated.\n\nAlso University College of London (UCL) has been conducting bistatic radar\n\nand SAR experiments with spaceborne transmitters and ground-based receivers\n\n36 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nsince 2002 [67, 68]. Specifically, several images were generated using Envisat as\n\nilluminator of opportunity and a dual-channel receiver. Further experiments are\n\nplanned with multi-channel receivers, allowing for the implementation Displaced\n\nPhase Center Antenna and Space-Time Adaptive Processing techniques to detect\n\nmoving targets.\n\nA bistatic X-band experiment was performed by DLR in November 2007.\n\nTerraSAR-X was used as transmitter and DLR\u2019s F-SAR was used as bistatic\n\nreceiver [34]. Trajectories of both platforms were designed to be nearly parallel\n\nto maximize footprint overlapping and to avoid poor range resolution\n\nconfigurations. Transmitting antenna was steered in azimuth, performing a spotlight\n\nillumination of the scene, while F-SAR was receiving in regular stripmap mode.\n\nContinuous bistatic data acquisition was preferred to overcome echo window\n\nsynchronization problems. The nominal mid-beam incidence angle was about 55?\n\nfor the transmitter and 45? for the receiver. Selected transmitted chirp bandwidth\nwas 100 MHz. A high PRF was chosen to guarantee high along-track oversampling\n\nrate of the bistatic data. The ground range dimension of the imaged scene was about\n\n2,500 m whereas along-track size of the scene varied between 600 and 900 m for\n\nnear and far range, respectively. Three X-band transponders were used as reference\n\ntargets on ground to quantify focused image quality and to precisely synchronize\n\nbistatic data. Footprint overlapping time was limited by standard duration of\n\nTerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight acquisitions: bistatic data therefore were\n\nrecorded during approximately 3.5 s. The achieved ground range resolution varied\n\nbetween 2.2 and 1.7 m for near and far range, respectively, whereas Doppler\n\nresolution on the ground yielded values between 0.25 and 0.39 m for 2.77 s integra-\n\ntion time. Peculiar effects of bistatic acquisitions were observed such as different\n\nbrightness distribution between monostatic and bistatic images and skewed point\n\ntarget response from the transponders, with different skewing angles due to the\n\ndifferent equivalent squint angles.\n\nVarious spaceborne-airborne bistatic SAR experiments were conducted by\n\nFGAN using TerraSAR-X satellite as transmitter and the airborne PAMIR system\n\nas receiver [69]. The first experiment was conducted in July 2008. The implemented\n\nbistatic configuration was similar to the previous DLR experiment, i.e. parallel-\n\ntracks with TerraSAR-X working in spotlight mode and PAMIR operating in\n\nstripmap mode. Some differences between those experiments, anyway, must be\n\nput in evidence. First of all, a different geometry was exploited with 47? transmitter\nincidence angle and 70? receiver incidence angle thus attaining about 23? bistatic\nangle at the scene centre. In addition, the 150 MHz TerraSAR-X bandwidth was\n\nutilized. Finally, an auxiliary antenna was mounted on the top of aircraft fuselage to\n\ngather the direct signal from the transmitter. The direct signal was used to set the\n\npulse repetition frequency of the receiver, but also to determine the residual\n\nunknown frequency offset between transmitter and receiver oscillators. A second\n\nexperiment was carried out in the beginning of year 2009. Again parallel tracks were\n\nselected but in this case also receiver antenna beam was steered during synthetic\n\naperture formation and the so-called \u201cdouble sliding spotlight mode\u201d was imple-\n\nmented to widen azimuth scene extent. The TerraSAR-X 300 MHz transmitting\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 37\n\n\n\nbandwidth was also utilized. From the focused images a good agreement between\n\nthe theoretical geometric resolutions and the achieved ones was verified. Finally,\n\nduring the bistatic campaigns also monostatic data were collected by either\n\nTerraSar-X and PAMIR. From the comparison between focused monostatic and\n\nbistatic images noticeable differences were observed in terms of scattering behavior\n\nbut also of geometric effects such as shadowing, foreshortening and layover.\n\nIn the framework of the same research activity an additional spaceborne-\n\nairborne experiment was conducted by FGAN in November 2009 [25]. Specifically,\n\nspotlight TerraSAR-X transmission was exploited and a backward-looking antenna,\n\nmounted on the loading ramp of PAMIR aircraft, was used to gather bistatic echoes.\n\nAs a matter of fact imaging conditions in forward- or backward-looking directions\n\nare the same, so the experiment also demonstrated the feasibility of bistatic SAR\n\nwith forward-looking receivers. Specifically, the experiment clearly put in evidence\n\nthe effects of pixel skewing, illustrated in Sect. 1.3.1, due to the peculiar observa-\n\ntion geometry in which the platforms did not move along parallel tracks.\n\nIn August 2009, NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and Indian\n\nSpace Research Organization\u2019s Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft attempted a bistatic\n\nSAR experiment to demonstrate the presence of ice deposits in permanently\n\nshadowed craters of the Lunar South Pole [70]. Both Chandrayaan-1 and LRO\n\nembarked a compact S-band SAR. The systems were designed to operate in bistatic\n\nmode with either Chandrayaan-1 or LRO transmitting and receiving. The main goal\n\nof the experiment was to measure Circular Polarization Ratio (CPR) of lunar polar\n\nregions from about 5? bistatic angle. Indeed, high CPR signatures had been\nobserved in Earth-based Arecibo monostatic measurements, indicating the possible\n\npresence of water ice. Different phenomena, however, can explain the observed\n\nhigh CPR in monostatic geometry, such as increased blockiness of lunar regolith\n\n[71]. Bistatic SAR measurements could be used to separate the effects of surface\n\nroughness from those of ice. Unfortunately, the experiment encountered technical\n\ndifficulties [72] and the Chandrayaan-1 mission ended before another attempt could\n\nbe initiated.\n\n1.4.3 Proposed Spaceborne Missions\n\nDuring last decades several examples of spaceborne bistatic mission have been\n\nproposed. Most of them characterized by spaceborne illuminator and airborne or\n\nground-based receivers but some examples of fully spaceborne missions also exist.\n\nIn the mid of 1980s a feasibility study was presented [73], describing a bistatic\n\nsystem for surveillance, essentially devoted to tactical scenarios. The proposed\n\nsolution relied on a constellation of L-band MEO satellites (about 10,000 km\n\naltitude) coupled with airborne and ground-based receivers. The constellation was\n\ndeveloped to achieve continuous global coverage whereas bistatic receivers had to\n\nperform conventional search and track radar functions, using SAR imaging and\n\n38 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nMTI techniques too. Some peculiarities of bistatic geometry were further put in\n\nevidence in Refs. [74, 75] where a constellation of X-band MEO illuminators\n\n(about 7,000 km altitude) was proposed for worldwide surveillance by airborne\n\nbistatic receivers. The orbital altitude was selected to match, approximately, the\n\nvelocity-to-range ratio of the transmitter to that of the receiver. In this way a proper\n\ncontrol over Doppler spectrum spreading due to ground clutter returns could be\n\nachieved, thus lowering, notably, the minimum detectable velocity with respect to\n\nmonostatic systems, when working in MTI mode. Different solutions exploiting\n\ngeosynchronous transmitters [76\u201378] were also proposed to reduce the number of\n\nrequired illuminators in surveillance and moving target detection applications.\n\nIn addition, the massive exploitation of non-cooperative LEO communication\n\nsatellites together with Earth-based receivers for vessel and target detection [79]\n\ncan be interpreted as a different approach to reduce the impact of the space segment\n\non the complexities and costs of bistatic systems.\n\nMore recently, new fully spaceborne bistatic mission concepts have been pro-\n\nposed relying on both radar and SAR system.\n\nAs far as scientific bistatic radar missions are concerned, fully spaceborne\n\nsystems have been proposed for oceanography by bistatic radar altimeters\n\n[80\u201382]. Specifically, a LEO constellation was presented in Ref. [80] able to reduce\n\nthe revisit time with respect to a constellation of monostatic altimeters. In Ref. [82]\n\nsimilar ideas have been presented, where the reduction of the revisit time is\n\nachieved collecting both monostatic and bistatic measurements by transmitting\n\nand receiving systems equipped with multi-beam antennas.\n\nFinally, several scientific mission concepts have been developed in the last\n\ndecade to realize bistatic SAR observations based on different LEO satellite\n\nformations. In this framework it is worth mentioning BISSAT/SABRINA mission\n\nstudy [20, 83], Cartwheel concept [84], Radarsat 2/3 program [85], and TanDEM-X\n\nmission [9, 10]. Similarities and differences exist between these missions. As part\n\nof mission objectives all the mission examples aimed at gathering bistatic SAR\n\nimages from close inter-satellite separations to apply along-track or cross-track\n\ninterferometric techniques (see Sect. 1.5.2.1). Cartwheel and Radarsat 2/3 were\n\nbased on dedicated satellite systems, whereas BISSAT/SABRINA and TanDEM-X\n\nwere conceived to complement a preexisting monostatic SAR mission by an\n\nadditional satellite to realize a spaceborne monostatic/bistatic SAR system. Mission\n\nphases with very large baselines, up to hundreds of kilometers, had been envisaged\n\nin the framework of BISSAT/SABRINA mission study. These acquisitions, able to\n\nproduce couples of monostatic/bistatic images characterized by large bistatic angles\n\n(up to 45?), were proposed to experiment innovative bistatic SAR techniques other\nthan interferometric ones (see Sect. 1.5.2.2). Large baseline bistatic SAR\n\nacquisitions, even though with reduced baselines, are currently planned in the last\n\npart of TanDEM-X mission. Further details about the most remarkable examples of\n\nbistatic SAR spaceborne mission studies and concepts can be found in Part 4.\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 39\n\n\n\n1.5 Bistatic SAR Techniques and Applications\n\nPossible applications of bistatic SAR depend on the number and type of data\n\nsimultaneously collected from a given target area. The following subsections deal\n\nwith the cases of images generated from a single receiving platform and from\n\nmultiple receiving ones, and illustrate the main applications. For each case an\n\nexample of promising technique is selected and the relevant applications are\n\nanalyzed in detail.\n\n1.5.1 Images from a Single Receiving Platform\n\nIn the simplest bistatic SAR configuration only images from a single receiving\n\nplatform can be produced. Nevertheless interesting scientific and practical\n\napplications can be accomplished. Indeed, bistatic SAR scattering mechanisms\n\n[86, 87] show many aspects that can be utilized to enhance imaging performance.\n\nFor instance, thanks to the reduced retro-reflector effects in bistatic SAR geometry,\n\na reduction of about 10\u201320 dB in image dynamic range has been experienced in\n\nairborne X-band surveys at three different bistatic angles [57]. Since signals of\n\nstrong retro-reflectors are reduced, weak signals can be made more prominent by an\n\nappropriate dynamic range at the receiver. Consequently, more details can be\n\ndetected in a bistatic SAR image than in a monostatic one: this peculiarity can\n\nbe used in bistatic observations aimed at the assessment of the extent or the\n\nmonitoring of the growth of urban areas, allowing for better biomass evaluation\n\n[8]. Furthermore, bistatic SAR mapping potentiality for several land applications\n\ncan be emphasized by using polarization modes. In this context, target detection in a\n\nnatural media, such as the maritime environment, can be improved by using\n\nmatched polarization states for which the clutter return is low [87].\n\nThe reported two examples of bistatic SAR applications have been validated by\n\nanalysis and experiments. However, as already noted, there are no assessed\n\ndatabases for bistatic scattering. This means that the number and type of bistatic\n\nSAR techniques and applications could potentially be wider. In this context a\n\nbistatic system, working in the single bistatic receiver configuration can be\n\ndesigned to collect data from different observation geometries and polarizations\n\nthus measuring and characterizing different, and innovative, aspects of bistatic SAR\n\nscattering mechanisms.\n\nOceanographic applications also take advantage of bistatic SAR implementa-\n\ntions. Bistatic data, as conventional monostatic SAR images, suffer from important\n\nlimitations when sea surface is observed. Specifically, Doppler resolution is usually\n\ndegraded in monostatic SAR by the sea wave motion during the formation of the\n\nsynthetic aperture. In addition, sea wave motion causes a shift between scattering\n\nelement real position and imaged one. Bistatic SAR features, able to reduce those\n\nlimitations, are reported in Sect. 1.5.1.1.\n\n40 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\n1.5.1.1 Example: Bistatic SAR Oceanography\n\nAdvantages of bistatic SAR observation in oceanographic applications can be put in\n\nevidence by characterizing well-known SAR imaging models of ocean waves to a\n\nbistatic geometry [88]. SAR observation of the sea is modeled as the scattering from\n\na rough moving surface [89, 90]. The height profile of sea surface in stationary\n\nconditions can be expressed as a sum of (infinite) harmonic components, each of\n\nthem characterized by its amplitude, phase, angular frequency and wavenumber or\n\nwavelength. Such a height profile generates different scales of roughness that affect\n\nradar observation differently. In radar scattering theory, surface roughness is\n\nrepresented in terms of its standard deviation and correlation length. Even if from\n\na theoretical point of view a continuous roughness distribution should be considered\n\n(i.e. both standard deviation and correlation length ranging from zero to infinity),\n\ndiscrete models are successfully adopted in practical applications and numerical\n\nstudies. Specifically a two scale model is considered in this section [91]. The model\n\nrepresents sea wave as a sum of two different waves (see Fig. 1.19):\n\n\u2022 Short waves, i.e. ripples;\n\n\u2022 Long waves.\n\nBoth long and short waves have significant effects on SAR images. Ripples or\n\ncapillarity waves comprise the sea wave components that match the Bragg reso-\n\nnance condition for radar signal wavelengths utilized in microwave remote sensing\n\n[89]. In this condition strong scattered signals are generated by sea surface and\n\ntherefore brighter pixels are derived in SAR images because the Bragg resonant\n\nwaves produces local echoes adding in phase. In monostatic SAR geometry the\n\nfollowing relation among radar signal wavelength, incidence angle and cross-track\n\nwavelength component of capillarity wave, ?, holds\n\nLm \u00bc l\n2 sinYTx\n\n(1.25)\n\nFig. 1.19 Illustration of a two scale model for surface height profile [91]\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 41\n\n\n\nwhereas in bistatic geometry the receiver incidence angle and the out-plane angle\n\nmust be taken into account too [88]\n\nLb \u00bc l\nsinYTx \u00fe sinYRx cosF (1.26)\n\nA monostatic X-band SAR, working with 45? incidence angle, meets the Bragg\ncondition when observing sea short waves with about 2 cm wavelength. Figure 1.20\n\nreports the Bragg-resonant sea wave components for X-band bistatic SAR. It is\n\nimmediate to note that additional information on sea state can be collected by\n\nbistatic SAR since different sea wave components contribute to SAR scattering in\n\nbistatic geometry.\n\nAs far as the scattering from long wave is concerned, three main effects arise:\n\n\u2022 Tilt effect, it is a purely geometric effect. The long waves generate a local\n\nvariability of the observation angles, that is different Bragg-resonant waves are\n\nimaged by the radar depending on their location along the long wave.\n\n\u2022 Hydrodynamic effect, cross-section modulation due to non uniform distribution\n\nof short waves with respect to long waves and due to their motion.\n\n\u2022 Orbital motion effects.\n\nThe orbital motion is the back-and-forth and up-and-down motion of sea surface\n\ngenerated by the motion of water particles within the waves. Those particles\n\nFig. 1.20 Wavelength\n\nof Bragg-resonant sea wave\n\ncomponents (cm) for X-band\n\nbistatic SAR as a function\n\nof receiver pointing angles\n\nat 45? transmitter incidence\nangle\n\n42 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\ndescribe a circular orbit with a diameter equal to the height of the wave. This\n\nmotion affects SAR images when [92]\n\noT\n2\n\n? 1 (1.27)\n\nwhere ? is the frequency of the wave. In such a case the orbital motion is\nresponsible for two important effects on SAR images: velocity bunching and\nacceleration smearing. The velocity bunching is a SAR peculiar artifact generated\nby SAR focusing algorithms. When a moving target is imaged, SAR focusing\n\nalgorithm, that is developed for stationary scenes, mistakes its Doppler history for\n\nthat of a stationary target placed in a different azimuth position. This results in a\n\nshift of moving target in the Doppler direction by an amount depending on target\n\nvelocity. When observing sea surface the velocity distribution produced by the\n\norbital motion is not uniform and so the Doppler displacements vary within\n\nthe imaged area: there are regions where image elements are grouped (i.e. bunched)\n\nbut others where they are emptied out. Velocity bunching can be in principle\n\nremoved from SAR image. In general non-linear techniques are needed and numer-\n\nical iterations have to be implemented [93]. Particular conditions, however, exist in\n\nwhich velocity bunching has a linear effect on SAR images, that is it can be\n\nmodeled, and hence removed too, by a linear modulation transfer function [88]\n\nMTF \u00bc ? C\nH\n\n(1.28)\n\nwhere C is a parameter depending on the observation geometry and H indicates the\nheight profile of the sea surface. The linear method can be effectively utilized when\n\nC<<1. For the sake of concreteness, a maximum values of 0.3 can be utilized as a\nboundary to limit the region of validity of the linear method. Bistatic SAR geometry\n\ncan be exploited to achieve linearity regions wider than in the monostatic case.\n\nIndeed with reference to parallel track, in-plane, same side bistatic SAR\n\nconfigurations the following relations has been derived in Ref. [88] for the ratio\n\nbetween the parameters C in bistatic and monostatic case\n\nCb\nCm\n\n\u00bc RRx\nRTx \u00fe RRx 1\u00fe\n\nG YRx;X\u00f0 \u00de\nG YTx;X\u00f0 \u00de\n\n? ?\n(1.29)\n\nwhere\n\nG Y;X\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc sin2Ysin2X\u00fe cos2Y (1.30)\n\nand X represents the angle between sea wave propagation direction and platforms\nmotion. In addition Cb and Cm are in the same linear relation with the main\nparameter of the sea state, such as wavelength and angular frequency [88].\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 43\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that Cb is always larger than Cm in the proposed same side\ngeometry. Figure 1.21a reports the percentage difference between Cb and Cm as a\nfunction of the incidence angle and the sea wave propagation angle: as a matter of\n\nfact the influence of sea wave propagation angle is very limited, moreover when\n\nlarge separations are achieved, the bistatic configuration offers a wider range (upper\n\nto 10\u201315%) of sea wave spectrum in which a linear SAR MTF is applicable for\n\nremoving velocity bunching effects.\n\nOrbital motion produces also a smearing in the focused SAR images of sea\n\nsurface, i.e. a distortion of the resolution cell and a degradation of the azimuth\n\nresolution, depending on the time variability (acceleration) of sea surface velocity.\n\nSince the acceleration smearing can be interpreted as the results of an instantaneous\n\nvelocity variation and therefore of a time-varying velocity bunching, bistatic SAR\n\noperation is able to reduce this effect with respect to monostatic SAR. With\n\nreference to parallel track, in-plane, same side bistatic SAR configurations, the\n\nbistatic improvement [88] can be quantified as the square of the ration between Cb\nand Cm (see Fig. 1.21b). The obtainable improvement is larger than 20% for large\nbaselines and is not affected by the actual sea wave propagation angle.\n\n1.5.2 Images from Two Platforms\n\nIf the transmitter is also a monostatic SAR or a multistatic system is considered\n\nin which more than one bistatic receiver is utilized, two or more images can be\n\nderived from the target area at the same time. In such a case, as introduced in\n\nFig. 1.21 Improvements (in percentage) of linearity region in bistatic geometry when accounting\n\nfor velocity bunching (a), and acceleration smearing effects (b). Transmitter and receiver are\n\nsupposed to orbit at 620 km altitude, 45? transmitter incidence angle has been assumed and the\nbaseline is so that the bistatic receiver is closer than transmitter to the target\n\n44 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nSect. 1.2, the separation between the receiving platforms becomes a crucial\n\nparameter. If the baseline is larger than the critical value the system can be defined\n\nas Large Baseline Bistatic (LBB) SAR [13, 20, 83], where the adjective \u201clarge\u201d\n\ndoes not identify a specific baseline length, but it simply remarks that phase\n\ncoherence cannot be used for data processing and interpretation. Concerning this,\n\na LBB SAR can be interpreted as the opposite of an Interferometric Bistatic SAR or\n\nbistatic SAR interferometer (InSAR), where phase coherence is mandatory thus\n\nlimiting the baseline to be shorter than the critical value.\n\n1.5.2.1 Coherent Combinations\n\nThe exploitation of phase coherence in Bistatic InSAR is the base for a variety of\n\nwell-known and widely investigated techniques and applications:\n\n\u2022 Along-track interferometry for moving target indication (MTI) in which opera-\ntion of an along-track interferometer is based on the acquisition of two SAR\n\nimages taken under identical geometry of observation, but separated by a short\n\ntime interval. When this is accomplished, any difference between the two\n\nimages results from changes in the scene. In particular, the phase difference\n\nbetween the echoes from the same target allows its radial speed to be measured\n\n[94]. An along-track interferometer can be realized by means of a monostatic-\n\nbistatic configuration, where one antenna is used for transmitting [19, 95]. In\n\nsuch a case the effective along-track baseline (i.e. the separation between\n\nantenna phase centers), is half the along-track physical separation between the\n\nantennas.\n\n\u2022 Cross-track interferometry for digital elevation model (DEM) generation and\ntomography in which operation of a cross-track interferometer is based on\ncoherent combination of the signals from two, horizontally or vertically\n\nseparated SAR antennas, to calculate the interferometric phase difference at\n\neach point of the image. The phase difference directly depends on the local relief\n\n[96]. DEM generation can greatly benefit from the simultaneous acquisition of\n\nthe two images in the bistatic configuration when compared to the classic\n\nmonostatic repeat-pass case. In fact, a considerable drop in the attainable\n\nperformance results from the decorrelation of interferometric image pairs\n\nacquired with time separation [97], due to radar wavelength-scale changes\n\noccurred in the scene between the observations. In addition, atmospheric\n\nartifacts [9, 98] will equally affect the two acquisitions of the bistatic configura-\n\ntion, thanks to the simultaneity and the slight difference in viewing geometry.\n\nWith regard to SAR Tomography, it is a technique to achieve focused 3-D SAR\n\nimages [99], thus overcoming the limitation of conventional monostatic SAR\n\nwhose images represent a projection of three-dimensional distributed scene\n\nreflectivity on the two-dimensional plane individuated by slant range and azi-\n\nmuth directions. The technique relies on an aperture synthesis along the direc-\n\ntion normal to the slant range within the elevation plane. This aperture is\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 45\n\n\n\nsynthesized by properly processing several SAR images of the same area\n\ngathered with (slightly) different off-nadir/incidence angles. Bi-/multistatic\n\nSAR tomography could be properly utilized for the analysis of volume scattering\n\nmechanisms, such as when vegetated areas or semi transparent media like snow\n\nor ice are observed [99], or in the framework of 3-D imaging and monitoring of\n\nurban areas [100].\n\n\u2022 Resolution enhancement thanks to the coherent combination of monostatic-\nbistatic or multistatic images [98, 101]. Indeed, if there is a difference in looking\n\nangle between the data, different spectral components of the ground range\n\nreflectivity spectrum can be sampled. Actually, their coherent combination\n\nresults in a larger signal bandwidth and therefore in a better geometric\n\nresolution.\n\nThe quantitative analysis of coherent bi-/multistatic SAR techniques is reported\n\nin Chap. 2, whereas the remainder of this chapter deals mainly with LBB SAR or\n\nbistatic SAR with a single receiving platform.\n\n1.5.2.2 Incoherent Combinations\n\nThe scientific applications of LBB SAR proposed in this section take advantage of\n\nthe difference in observation geometry between monostatic and bistatic sensors, or\n\namong different bistatic receivers. Possible applications include:\n\n\u2022 Stereo-radargrammetry: it is well-known that SAR images taken under very\ndifferent viewing angles can be used to perform three-dimensional terrain\n\nmeasurements by making use of the stereo effect. Up to now stereo-\n\nradargrammetric applications were realized only by repeat-track monostatic\n\ndata, i.e. un-simultaneously collected data. Monostatic-Bistatic or Multistatic\n\nStereo-Radargrammetry is able to avoid time decorrelation thus achieving better\n\naccuracy (see Sect. 1.5.2.2.1 for the details).\n\n\u2022 Acquisition of terrain slope: the bistatic scattering coefficient can be related to\nthe root mean square surface slope within a resolution cell [102], and on this\n\nbasis a model can be developed to derive terrain slope from bistatic data [83].\n\n\u2022 Measurements of surface roughness, dielectric constant and soil moisture: the\navailability of both monostatic and bistatic data with a reasonably large (about\n\n30?) difference in viewing angle would significantly help the retrieval of surface\nroughness and dielectric constant [89]. In fact, the difference in the scattering\n\ncoefficient at two bistatic angles is small for very rough surfaces and large\n\n(several dB) for smooth surfaces. With regard to soil moisture, its effect on the\n\namplitude of the backscattered monostatic signal has been largely investigated,\n\nand the effectiveness of its retrieval by radar operating at a low frequency (such\n\nas the L-band) has been well established, particularly in presence of moderate\n\nvegetation cover. The potential of using bistatic SAR measurements for retriev-\n\ning soil moisture has been investigated in Ref. [103]. The results indicate that,\n\nparticularly at the C-band, the estimation of soil moisture can strongly be\n\n46 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_2\n\n\nimproved (namely the error standard deviation is reduced up to a factor of 3 with\n\nrespect to a monostatic radar) by complementing monostatic and bistatic\n\nmeasurements.\n\n\u2022 Velocity measurements by Doppler analysis: the relations among Doppler\ncentroid frequencies, position and velocity vectors of the platforms and bistatic\n\nslant range can be utilized to develop a procedure to compute the slant range\n\ncomponents of target velocity along bistatic slant range. The technique applies to\n\nboth monostatic-bistatic and multistatic configurations. The most attractive\n\napplications are oceanographic, being possible to generate velocity and direction\n\nmaps of sea waves [8].\n\n1.5.2.2.1 Example: Bistatic Stereo-Radargrammetry\n\nFour different techniques exist to derive terrain height from SAR data: clinometry,\n\npolarimetry, stereo-radargrammetry and interferometry [104]. Clinometry uses\n\nshadows and occulted areas to extract relative elevations of specific targets from\n\na single image. After a good development during the mid-1990s, SAR clinometry\n\nremained a marginal technique, useful only where it is quite difficult to derive\n\nground truth, such as for extraterrestrial sites. Polarimetry allows measurement of\n\nazimuthal slopes and so can provide an estimation of terrain elevation [105]. The\n\ntechnique is strongly affected by the quality of selected complex scattering models\n\n(especially over forested and agricultural lands) and two orthogonal passes are\n\nneeded for DEM generation [106], for this reason up to now only airborne data\n\nwere utilized. SAR interferometry, based on the coherent combination of two or\n\nmore SAR images, is the most mature and accurate method for wide-area DEM\n\ngeneration, as described in Sec. 5.2.1. SAR interferometry, however, suffers from\n\nsome main drawbacks. Indeed, the phase interferogram must be unwrapped to\n\nresolve the modulo 2? ambiguity before estimating topography. Different\napproaches exist for phase unwrapping [96], usually a time-consuming and difficult\n\ntask that cannot be avoided. Moreover height estimation accuracy shows high\n\nsensitivity to phase decorrelation. In forested or mountain slope areas phase coher-\n\nence can be very low, and a incorrect solution of the phase unwrapping problem\n\nmight be derived, often leading to diverging errors in interferometric DEM genera-\n\ntion [107]. Finally very accurate antenna relative positioning, up to millimeter level\n\n[9, 10], is needed to limit DEM errors. Part of those constraints can be mitigated by\n\nbistatic stereo-radargrammetry.\n\nClassic stereo-radargrammetry refers to the processing of pairs of monostatic\n\nimages, taken on the same area under different viewing angles, for computing\n\nterrain elevation [108]. It exploits the stereo-effect, as in optical photogrammetry,\n\nbut also accounts for side-looking monostatic SAR geometry: points on the Earth\u2019s\n\nsurface exhibit different displacements in SAR images as a function of their\n\nelevation, position in the range line, and radar pointing angles. The relief recon-\n\nstruction procedure is based on the measurement of the difference (parallax) in\n\ntarget positions in the two images forming the stereoscopic pair and on the\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 47\n\n\n\nequations relating the positions and heights of viewed targets. Typically, the target\n\nheight is directly linked to the parallax difference between the two observations, and\n\nthe parallax is expressed as a function of target slant ranges or ground ranges, which\n\nare the typical cross-track coordinates in radar images. As a matter of fact, both\n\ninterferometry and stereo-radargrammetry are based on the notion of detecting\n\nrelative displacements between two images, except that InSAR uses phase domain\n\ndata, whereas stereo-radargrammetry exploits range/Doppler and amplitude\n\nmeasurements. Hence, stereo-radargrammetry is intrinsically more robust to com-\n\npute terrain elevation with respect to interferometry because it is less sensitive to\n\ndecorrelation and is not affected by phase-unwrapping problems. Moreover stereo-\n\nradargrammetry, unlike InSAR, does not operate on wavelength scales thus also\n\nrelaxing the relative positioning requirements. On the other hand, just due to the\n\nwavelength scale operation, in high correlation areas data provided by SAR inter-\n\nferometry are, no doubts, more accurate and with a finer resolution [107].\n\nLarge separations between the receiving platforms are needed to generate the\n\nnecessary stereo-effect for high accuracy DEM generation by stereo-radargrammetry.\n\nThis is the reason why stereo-radargrammetric applications were realized only by\n\nmonostatic data, which so far have been collected along separated passes, to achieve\n\nvery large (from tens to hundreds of kilometers) cross-track baselines in LEO.\n\nIn LBB SAR two (or more) images are acquired simultaneously, i.e. with no time\n\ndependence, so LBB SAR guarantees an accuracy improvement with respect to\n\nclassic stereo-radargrammetry.\n\nThe experiences on monostatic repeat-pass data show that different acquisition\n\ngeometries are exploitable [109]: same and opposite sides, steep and shallow look\n\nangles. From a geometric point of view larger stereo-intersection angles (i.e. very\n\nlarge baselines and opposite-side stereo pairs) provide the best results. Actually,\n\nwhen dealing with real-world data, large radiometric discrepancies are generated in\n\nopposite-side geometry thus limiting previous advantages, especially as terrain\n\nslope and time effects due to non-simultaneity between the images increase.\n\nTherefore, provided that a minimum intersection angle of 5\u201310? is guaranteed in\nrepeat-pass same-side geometry, it is possible to state that there is not a significant\n\ncorrelation between DEM accuracy and acquisition geometry in monostatic\n\nradargrammetry.\n\nIn a spaceborne bistatic scenario, however, further considerations are needed.\n\nFirst of all it is worth noting that the bistatic angle plays the same role in bistatic\n\nradargrammetry as the stereo-intersection angle in monostatic repeat-pass one. The\n\nbistatic image quality, in terms of geometric and radiometric resolutions, is greatly\n\naffected by bistatic geometry, even before stereo reconstruction, therefore the effect\n\nof the acquisition geometry on bistatic image parameters must be accounted for\n\nwhen selecting the bistatic configuration for radargrammetric DEM generation.\n\nMoreover, when bistatic images are adopted to form a stereoscopic pair, new\n\nrelations are needed to define target height as a function of the peculiar parameters\n\nof bistatic surveying geometry [8]. Namely, the models of classical stereo-\n\nradargrammetry can be specialized to the bistatic configuration, but also new\n\nmodels can be developed. In Ref. [110] various models have been proposed and\n\n48 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nanalyzed for stereo-radargrammetric relief reconstruction by spaceborne bistatic\n\nSAR. The models have been specified to LEO monostatic-bistatic observation\n\ngeometry. This configuration is herein taken as a reference, even if the basic\n\nprinciples of those methods hold for multistatic configurations too and the relevant\n\nequations could be derived.\n\nMonostatic-bistatic SAR stereo-radargrammetry can take advantage of in-plane\n\nsame-side observation geometry and parallel tracks. In-plane configuration reduces\n\ngeometric distortions and pixel skewing effects that are usually generated in out-of-\n\nplane bistatic SAR acquisitions. Moreover same-side data collection, even though\n\nlimited in forming large bistatic angles, allows the system to reduce bistatic ground\n\nrange resolution degradation. In addition, if the bistatic sensor is closer to the target,\n\nit can take advantages of stronger echoes, also benefiting from an improvement in\n\nDoppler resolution. Finally, LEO formation flying satellites can implement stable\n\npendulum configurations [83], able to attain same side bistatic geometry close to in-\n\nplane conditions with almost parallel tracks, thus also reducing maintenance\n\noperations.\n\nAs noted above, there is not a unique approach for bistatic stereo radargrammetry.\n\nEven if the stereo-effect is exploited in any case, two different methodology can be\n\nindividuated:\n\n\u2022 Parallax-basedmethods, which principle is borrowed from optical photogrammetry.\n\u2022 True stereo radar methods, which rely on the peculiarity of radar and SAR\n\nacquisition.\n\nParallax-based methods utilize the concept of parallax difference between the\n\nobservations forming the stereoscopic pair [108]. In general, the parallax differ-\n\nence, d~p, is a two-dimensional vector because the same target, due to differences in\nobservation geometry, can be projected in points on the two images that present\n\nboth cross-track and along-track displacements. The height reconstruction by the\n\nparallax method therefore can be resumed by the following equation\n\nh ~r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ~F ? d~p (1.31)\n\nwhere h is the altitude of the target ~r and the function ~F depends, through the\nselected method, on the parameters of the observation geometry, essentially trans-\n\nmitter and receiver positions and velocity with respect to the target [110\u2013112].\n\nParallax-based height computation relies on relative measurements, i.e. a reference\n\nsurface, datum, must be defined and height are computed with respect to datum\n\nlevel. Hence, whereas the absolute parallax is defined with reference to the target\n\nrelief displacement in the radar image, parallax differences are obtained with\n\nrespect to datum, which allows definition of a reference parallax that must be\n\ncalculated to derive target relative height [8]. Finally, accurate knowledge of the\n\nheight of a limited number of ground control points is needed to evaluate topogra-\n\nphy. In parallel-track same-side in-plane monostatic-bistatic geometry, with\n\nno squint angle, targets are focused in the common range elevation plane, so a\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 49\n\n\n\nscalar parallax difference can be utilized, as in Ref. [110] where parallax-based\n\nreconstruction equations derived under flat-Earth hypothesis are presented.\n\nParallax-based methods strongly rely on image quality and on capability to\n\nextract information from images. However, the intrinsic nature of radar, and of\n\nSAR too, allows direct access to slant range and Doppler measurements. On this\n\nbasis the parallax difference can be expressed as a function of SAR measurements\n\nand not obtained just as result of image processing procedures [110]. This statement\n\nis of fundamental importance to pass from optical derived approaches to true stereo\n\nradar methods. The most notable example of such methods is the rigorous stereo\n\nSAR problem [108]. The equations defining the problem in monostatic bistatic\n\ngeometry are\n\nRTx \u00bc ~PTx ?~r\n?? ?? (1.32)\n\nRRx \u00bc ~PTx \u00fe ~B?~r\n?? ?? (1.33)\n\nfTx \u00bc\n2 ~VTx ?~v\n? ? ? ~PTx ?~r? ?\n\nl ~PTx ?~r\n?? ?? (1.34)\n\nfRx \u00bc 1l\n~VTx ?~v\n? ? ? ~PTx ?~r? ?\n\n~PTx ?~r\n?? ?? ? ~VTx \u00fe ~VB ?~v\n\n? ? ? ~PTx \u00fe ~B?~r? ?\n~PTx \u00fe ~B?~r\n?? ?? (1.35)\n\nwhere fTx and fRx are the monostatic and bistatic Doppler centroid frequencies,\nrespectively, and ~VB indicates the relative velocity between the platforms (bistatic\nwith respect to monostatic one). Equations 1.32 and 1.33 define monostatic and\n\nbistatic range spheres, while (1.34) and (1.35) individuate monostatic and bistatic\n\nDoppler cones. Differently from classic photogrammetry, where triangulation\n\nequations are applied on corresponding targets identified in photographic images\n\nby means of the optical stereo reconstruction obtained thanks to stereocomparators\n\n[113], monostatic and bistatic slant ranges and Doppler centroid frequencies are\n\nderived for each image point of co-registered data, as in numerical photogramme-\n\ntry. Concerning monostatic radargrammetry least square methods can be used to\n\nderive target positions, and target height too, accounting for spherical or ellipsoidal\n\nzero relief surface and assuming a static scene (i.e. ~v \u00bc 0). The equations valid in\nbistatic geometry are quite similar to the monostatic repeat-pass case, however an\n\nessential difference arises [110]: the introduction, in the equations of the problem,\n\nof the baseline vector and of the relative velocity, instead of receiver position and\n\nvelocity, allows for a reduction of the overall error in the determination of the target\n\nposition with respect to the monostatic case, because relative positioning and\n\nnavigation of formation flying satellites is able to achieve better accuracy than\n\nthe absolute navigation utilized in monostatic repeat-pass algorithms. Finally, it is\n\nworth noting that, thanks to its vector formulation, the rigorous stereo SAR problem\n\ncan be readily applied to any bistatic and multistate geometry.\n\n50 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nThe first step of both parallax-based and true stereo SAR methods is the image\n\nmatching: that is relating a pixel of the bistatic image to the corresponding one in\n\nthe monostatic image. In this way it is possible to associate both monostatic and\n\nbistatic SAR measurements (range/Doppler, ground range/azimuth\u2026) of each\n\nobserved target. Concerning this, it is important to remark that, as noted in\n\nSect. 1.3.2, speckle noise is generated in the images produced by the considered\n\nmonostatic-bistatic system. For this reason proper pattern recognition and image\n\nco-registration algorithms have to be used to guarantee sub-pixel co-registration\n\naccuracy [109], that is fundamental for accurate DEM generation. A quality decay\n\nof image matching can result from angle decorrelation and SNR degradation.\n\nAs shown in Ref. [110], the performance of parallax-based method are strongly\n\naffected by the quality of the image matching, whereas true stereo SARmethods are\n\ncharacterized by greater robustness since their performance is only partially\n\ninfluenced by co-registration errors. The following sub-section reports an example\n\nof error budget model for the rigorous stereo SAR problem and shows the achiev-\n\nable height estimation accuracy considering same side monostatic-bistatic\n\nacquisitions performed by two LEO satellites flying in formation.\n\nError Budget of Height Estimation Accuracy\n\nA general approach for the development of an error budget is to perform a\n\npropagation of the height estimation error. For any given reconstruction method,\n\nthe height is a function of a series of parameters, S1, S2, \u2026, Sn\n\nh \u00bc h S1; S2; . . . ; Sn\u00f0 \u00de (1.36)\n\nIf only random errors are considered, i.e. assuming that a limited number of\n\nground control points can be used to reduce systematic errors, the basic propagation\n\nfor the variance of h is\n\ns2h TOTj \u00bc\nX\ni\n\n@h\n\n@Si\n\n? ?2\ns2Si \u00fe\n\nX\ni;j\n\ni 6\u00bcj\n\n@h\n\n@Si\n\n@h\n\n@Sj\n\n????\n????sSiSj (1.37)\n\nwhere sSi is the uncertainty of the parameter Si, sSiSjis the cross correlation between\nthe parameters Si and Sj, and the partial derivatives represent the height sensitivity\nto uncertainties in the parameters. For the monostatic-bistatic rigorous stereo SAR\n\nproblem, the functional model of height reconstruction is\n\nh \u00bc h PTx; ~VTx; ~B; ~VB;RTx;RRx; fTx; fRx\n? ?\n\n(1.38)\n\nand all parameters can be considered uncorrelated with the exception of the\n\nmonostatic and bistatic slant ranges and Doppler centroid frequencies.\n\nEquations 1.32\u20131.35 do not provide an explicit formulation for the height compu-\n\ntation functional model, however, the height sensitivities to the different parameters\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 51\n\n\n\ncan be derived numerically from the equations of the problem when observation\n\ngeometry is assigned.\n\nFor evaluating the overall height estimation accuracy a pendulum formation is\n\nconsidered, in which monostatic and bistatic satellites share semi-major axis,\n\neccentricity, inclination and argument of perigee. The remaining parameters can\n\nbe then selected to maximize the area on which bistatic acquisition can be achieved\n\n[31]. Assuming the Italian COSMOSkyMed mission as a reference for the\n\nmonostatic sensor [114], and considering the bistatic sensor working with constant\n\noff-nadir angle, the covered latitudes ranges from about \u00b165? for 5? off-nadir angle,\nto \u00b180? for 20? off-nadir angle. In the first case the baseline ranges from 200 to\n550 km with 7\u201327? bistatic angle, whereas for 20? off-nadir angle shorter\nseparations are attained ranging from 100 to 400 km with 2\u201314? bistatic angle.\nEven if important out-of-plane baseline components (up to 50 km) are generated by\n\nthe relative orbital motion, the considered pendulum formation establishes bistatic\n\nobservation geometries quite close to the in-plane condition. In this case height\n\nsensitivities to ~VTx, ~VB, fTx, fRx and to the along-track baseline are very limited and the\nheight uncertainty generated by errors on those parameters is negligible. On this\n\nbasis the error budget model for height estimation accuracy can be written as\n\ns2h TOTj \u00bc s2~PTx \u00fe\n@h\n\n@Bc\n\n? ?2\ns2Bc \u00fe\n\n@h\n\n@Br\n\n? ?2\ns2Br \u00fe\n\n@h\n\n@RTx\n\n? ?2\ns2RTx\n\n\u00fe @h\n@RRx\n\n? ?2\ns2RRx \u00fe 2\n\n@h\n\n@RTx\n\n@h\n\n@RRx\n\n????\n????sRTxRRx (1.39)\n\nwhere Bc and Br are cross-track and radial baseline components, respectively. The\nuncertainty sRTxRRx can be expressed as the product of monostatic and bistatic slant\nrange uncertainties [110]. In (1.39) the height sensitivity to monostatic sensor\n\nposition deserves more attention. Indeed, according to (1.37) and (1.38), for ~PTx\n\u00bc XTx; YTx; ZTx\u00f0 \u00de, the relevant term should be\n\ns2\nh ~PTxj \u00bc\n\n@h\n\n@XTx\n\n? ?2\ns2XTx \u00fe\n\n@h\n\n@YTx\n\n? ?2\ns2YTx \u00fe\n\n@h\n\n@ZTx\n\n? ?2\ns2ZTx (1.40)\n\nhowever the following result can be verified [110]\n\n@h\n\n@XTx\n\n? ?2\n\u00fe @h\n\n@YTx\n\n? ?2\n\u00fe @h\n\n@ZTx\n\n? ?2\n\u00bc 1 (1.41)\n\nso, if the same uncertainty is assumed for each component of the monostatic sensor,\n\nit is immediate to conclude that an error in monostatic platform position merely\n\nproduces an identical error on target altitude (a result shared with SAR interferom-\n\netry [96]). The uncertainties of the monostatic antenna position basically depend on\n\nthe accuracy of the absolute navigation system. A value of 1 m for each component\n\n52 A. Moccia and A. Renga\n\n\n\nof position is compatible with present generation medium accuracy GPS-based\n\nnavigation solutions. As regard to the baseline, differential GPS algorithms allow\n\ndynamic relative state with decimeter-to-centimeter accuracy to be computed,\n\ntherefore a conservative value of 0.5 m can be assumed for the uncertainties of\n\neach baseline component. Monostatic slant range uncertainties are linked to the\n\ndimension, ?rTx, of monostatic slant range resolution element. A reasonable\nexpression can be derived considering the quantization error and assuming that\n\nthe actual slant range to the target has a uniform distribution within a cell [110]\n\ns2RTx \u00bc\n1\n\n12\nDr2Tx (1.42)\n\nCOSMOSkyMed stripmap products are characterized by a final ground range\n\nresolution of 3\u201315 m, so values of 3 and 0.75 m can be assumed for ground range\n\nand azimuth resolution of single-look-complex data. Bistatic slant range uncer-\n\ntainty depends on bistatic slant range resolution, as the monostatic one, and it is also\n\nrelated to the error resulting from the application of co-registration procedures\n\nrequired to form stereo pairs. A value of 1/10 of an image pixel is compatible with\n\nareas where medium-to-high correlation is achieved. Hence, bistatic slant range\n\nuncertainty can be calculated as follows\n\ns2RRx \u00bc\n1\n\n12\nDr2Rx \u00fe\n\nDrRx\n10\n\n? ?2\n\u00fe DaRx\n\n10\n\n? ?2\n(1.43)\n\nwhere DaRx is bistatic azimuth resolution. Bistatic resolutions can be easily\ncomputed for the selected pendulum configuration by the gradient method (see\n\nSec. 1.3.1). Figure 1.22 reports the contributions of the considered error sources to\n\nheight estimation uncertainty; the overall height estimation error is also shown\n\n(lower right plot). It is worth noting that the reported slight increase of the height\n\nuncertainty for small off-nadir angles of the bistatic satellite and low latitudes does\n\nnot rely on a change of the sensitivity function, but it is due to the increase of\n\nbistatic slant range uncertainty. In fact a degradation of the bistatic slant range\n\nresolution is attained for very large bistatic angles.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the present analysis, monostatic-bistatic spaceborne\n\nstereo-radargrammetry is able to measure local target relief with a metric accuracy.\n\nThe best results can be obtained when a small off-nadir angle is selected for the\n\nbistatic sensor, so that long baselines can be reached and large bistatic angles are\n\nestablished. Finally, it is worth noting that considering 5\u201310? bistatic off-nadir\nangles the height estimation accuracy is practically constant, i.e. it is not much\n\naffected by target latitude, hence very accurate DEMs can be generated on very\n\nlarge areas.\n\n1 Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar 53\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A number of application domains are\n\ndiscussed, with an emphasis on single- and multi-baseline interferometric\n\ntechniques, deriving lower and upper bounds to the required spacecraft separation.\n\nSeveral multistatic formation concepts (Cartwheel, Helix, etc.) are discussed within\n\nthe general framework provided by the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations. Several\n\ncanonical multistatic acquisition modes (bistatic, alternate bistatic, etc.) are\n\nintroduced, and the particularities of standard SAR modes in a distributed mission\n\nscenario are discussed. Here, the drawbacks of burst-modes such as ScanSAR or\n\nTOPS in a multistatic configuration are highlighted. Relevant theory with regard to\n\noscillator phase noise is introduced and followed by a discussion of several phase\n\nsynchronization approaches. These include TanDEM-X like synchronization links,\n\nwhich are the preferred option for most high frequency mission concepts, and GNSS\n\nor data driven approaches, which may be adequate for less demanding or for lower\n\nfrequency systems. At the end of the chapter, three novel proposed missions are\n\ndiscussed: the high-end Tandem-L mission; SIGNAL, a compact Ka-band mission;\n\nand PICOSAR, a C-band low cost passive add-on mission concept.\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nBistatic radars are strictly defined as systems where the transmitter and receiver are\n\nphysically separated. A multistatic radar system extends this concept by using\n\nmultiple physically separated receivers and/or transmitters so that at least two\n\nsimultaneous radar data sets are generated.

From\n\nan application point of view, the multiple combinations of transmitters and\n\nreceivers increase the dimensionality of the measurement space. For example, the\n\nTanDEM-X mission [1] exploits this to derive highly accurate Digital Elevation\n\nModels (DEMs) from single-pass interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\n\nmeasurements (InSAR), thus adding a third dimension to the 2-D SAR data\n\nproducts. From an engineering point of view, multistatic systems are appealing\n\nbecause of their efficient use of resources, since a larger fraction of the scattered\n\nradar signal is collected, and because they allow breaking up a large and complex\n\nsystem into a collection of smaller and simpler individual subsystems.\n\nThis chapter discusses general aspects of space-borne multistatic SAR concepts.\n\nThe discussion is restricted to formation-flying systems, with a strong emphasis on\n\nsingle- or multi-baseline interferometric applications. The goal is to provide the\n\nreader with an overview of the principal aspects to consider in the design of a\n\nmultistatic system or mission. Detailed examples of several multistatic missions or\n\nmission concepts are discussed in Part 4 of this book.\n\n2.1.1 Historical Overview\n\nBuilding on the success of many spaceborne monostatic radar missions, which have\n\nbecome a fundamental component of the Earth Observation (EO) mix, during the\n\nlast two decades, a number of multistatic radar mission concepts have been pro-\n\nposed. One driving concept was the idea of acquiring single-pass interferometric\n\ndata to generate global DEMs. For example, in the early 1990s, NASA\u2019s Jet\n\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) proposed the TOPSAT mission concept. One of the\n\ntwo alternative implementations considered was an L-band formation flying\n\nmultistatic system, which would have provided 30 m horizontal resolution DEMs\n\nwith height errors between 2 and 5 m [2].\n\nFollowing the success of their RADARSAT program, the Canadian Space\n\nAgency (CSA) also proposed the formation flying RADARSAT-2/3 C-band topo-\n\ngraphic mission concept [3, 4], which presents many commonalities with\n\nGermany\u2019s TanDEM-X mission. During the same period of time, France\u2019s Centre\n\nNational d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (CNES), proposed the revolutionary Interferometric\n\nCartwheel concept, which added a formation of three compact receive-only space-\n\ncraft to an existing C- or L-band monostatic mission such as ESA\u2019s ENVISAT\n\nmission, or JAXA\u2019s ALOS [5].\n\nThe crown to this series of multistatic topographic missions is the aforemen-\n\ntioned German TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation\n\nMeasurements) mission [1], proposed in 2003 and in operation since the launch\n\n62 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nof the TanDEM-X satellite in June 2010. Its successful operation has demonstrated\n\nthe value and feasibility of multistatic radar missions, producing 12 m horizontal\n\nresolution DEMs with height accuracies better than 2 m, and successfully\n\naddressing the synchronization and relative positioning and navigation challenges\n\nassociated with such a mission.\n\nA non-interferometric mission concept was TechSat-21 (Technology Satellite of\n\nthe twenty-first century) [6], studied by the US Air Force Research Laboratory as an\n\nexperimental system to demonstrate a distributed, and in-space reconfigurable,\n\nradar using low-cost individual systems. This program was cancelled in 2003.\n\n2.1.2 Definitions and Basic Principles\n\n2.1.2.1 Monostatic and Bistatic Phase Center\n\nOne recurring term in this chapter will be that of the equivalent phase center. The\n\nconcept of phase center is fundamentally monostatic in nature. For a monostatic\n\nradar the phase center is the electrical center of the antenna. The radar range to a\n\ntarget is defined as the distance between the target and the phase center of the radar.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that for a moving radar, the physical position of the phase\n\ncenter changes between the transmission of the radar pulse and the reception of\n\nthe corresponding radar echoes. In this case, the equivalent phase center for each\n\npulse is located at the mid-point between those two positions. The same concept can\n\nbe extended to a bistatic measurement, for which the equivalent phase center\n\ncan be placed approximately in the mid-point between the position of the transmit-\n\nter at the instant it transmits the pulse, and the position of the receiver when it\n\nreceives the echoes.\n\nFor a synthetic aperture, the equivalent phase center depends on the position of\n\nthe target and on the SAR processing. In general, it can be placed at the orbital\n\nposition at which the radar sees a target with the Doppler frequency corresponding\n\nto the center of the processed Doppler band. For SAR systems using a Total Zero\n\nDoppler Steering law [7], this position will correspond to the point at which the\n\nradar sees the target in a direction orthogonal to its trajectory in Earth Centered\n\nEarth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates.\n\n2.1.2.2 Multistatic Configurations\n\nIn this chapter three types of configurations are considered:\n\n\u2022 Fully-active systems are formed by a number of in principle identical spacecraft\nwith full radar systems [8] (Fig. 2.1, left panel). Therefore, each spacecraft can\n\nacquire monostatic images, or be used as a passive receiver recording the\n\nbistatic radar echoes of the signal transmitted by another satellite. It is also\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 63\n\n\n\npossible to interleave transmit pulses from multiple spacecraft and receive\n\nwith all. This means that for Ns spacecraft, the number of non-redundant\npossible phase centers is\n\nNp \u00bc Ns ? \u00f0Ns \u00fe 1\u00de\n2\n\n: (2.1)\n\nNote that there is a quadratic relation between the number of spacecraft and the\n\nnumber of possible phase centers. However, fully benefiting from all the\n\npossible phase centers with more than two spacecraft would require complex\n\nand innovative techniques that are currently far beyond the state of the art.\n\nFully-active configurations offer the maximum flexibility and redundancy, and\n\nare an attractive and cost-effective configuration for multistatic systems with a\n\nsmall number of spacecraft. A prime example of a fully-active system is\n\nTanDEM-X [1].\n\n\u2022 Semi-active systems [8] are formed by a single active illuminator and a number\nof receive-only passive systems (Fig. 2.1, right panel) . Examples of semi-active\n\nconcepts are the Interferometric Cartwheel [5, 9], or theBISSATmission [10], both\n\nof which were conceived as low-cost add-ons to existing monostatic missions.\n\nStrictly speaking, this kind of semi-active add-on system yields one bistatic image\n\nfor each passive spacecraft plus the original monostatic data. However, for most\n\napplications (e.g. SAR interferometry) only the bistatic ones can be combined,\n\nsince the transmitter and the passive receivers are typically separated by a large\n\nalong-track distance for safety reasons. Besides these opportunistic mission\n\nconcepts, for future missions conceived from their beginning as multistatic, a\n\nsemi-active architecture allows also the simplification of the illuminator, which\n\ncould be transmit-only. In this case, continuouswave (CW) radar concepts could be\n\ndeveloped, allowing for significantly lower peak power requirements [11].\n\n\u2022 Multi-monostatic SAR systems consist of a number of monostatic SAR space-\ncraft operated as a distributed sensor [12]. Although these are not multistatic in\n\nnature, they have many commonalities both in terms of system design and of\n\npotential applications. In fact, a fully-active system can easily be operated in a\n\nFig. 2.1 Left: illustration of a fully-active multistatic system. Right: illustration of a semi-active\nsystem with a full SAR system as transmitter and a constellation of small receiver spacecraft\n\n64 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nmulti-monostatic mode, as it was done, for example, in the pursuit monostatic\nphase of the TanDEM-X mission.\n\nBesides these three canonic configurations, it is clear that a number of hybrid\n\ncombinations are possible. For example, a semi-active configuration with two\n\nilluminators would duplicate the number of bistatic phase centers.\n\n2.1.2.3 Cooperative Versus Opportunistic Systems\n\nMultistatic missions can also be classified as cooperative or opportunistic. Oppor-\n\ntunistic systems, such as the Interferometric Cartwheel, are monostatic systems that\n\nuse an existing system as a transmitter of opportunity. This system can be a\n\nmonostatic SAR system, but also another type of source such as, for example,\n\nGNSS satellites [13]. Opportunistic systems are cost-effective, since the\n\nilluminating component is already provided. Their main technological drawback,\n\nor challenge, is the lack of explicit synchronization mechanisms.\n\nIn contrast, cooperative systems are from their onset designed to allowmultistatic\n\noperations, including, for example, dedicated synchronization sub-systems.\n\n2.1.2.4 Slow-Time and Frequency Synchronization\n\nA key aspect of any multistatic mission is the synchronization of the system. Here\n\nwe distinguish between two levels of synchronization:\n\n\u2022 With slow-time synchronization it is meant the alignment of the transmit pulses\nand the acquisition of the echo windows by the multiple receivers. This level of\n\nsynchronization requires a common time-frame. GNSS (GPS) time is accurate\n\nenough to meet the requirements, so a link between the on-board navigation\n\nsystem and the Instrument Control Unit (ICU) is required.\n\n\u2022 Phase synchronization means the alignment in phase of the frequency sources\nused by the radar sub-systems, which include the phases of the Local Oscillators\n\n(LO), but also that of the sampling clocks. This level of synchronization is orders\n\nof magnitude more demanding than the slow-time alignment and will usually\n\nrequire dedicated sub-systems or the use of sophisticated processing techniques.\n\n2.2 Application Examples\n\n2.2.1 Cross-Track Interferometry for Topographic Mapping\n\nSingle-pass cross-track InSAR [14\u201316] is the most straightforward application of a\n\nmultistatic SAR system. Since the launch of the second TerraSAR-X like satellite\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 65\n\n\n\nand the start of the TanDEM-X mission [1], it is also the first (and at the time of\n\nwriting only) operational distributed radar application.\n\nCross-track interferometry (XTI) has been used successfully to derive digital\n\nelevation models (DEMs) of Earth for decades, in most cases combining data\n\nacquired during repeated passes of a single spacecraft. In these repeat-pass\n\nscenarios, the main contribution to the final error budget is the loss of coherence\n\ndue to temporal decorrelation: the radar scattering coefficient is generally speaking\n\na random process. To avoid this loss of coherence, single-pass interferometric\n\nconfigurations are required. This was done for the first time from space during\n\nthe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) [17], which used a 60 m boom to\n\nprovide a physical baseline between two receive antennas.\n\nCross-track InSAR is a powerful and well established technique to measure\n\nsurface topography. The principle of cross-track interferometry is illustrated in\n\nFig. 2.2 for the case of two spacecraft. Due to the separation between the two\n\nsatellites, the distance from a point on the surface to the first satellite (r1) and to the\nsecond one (r2) differ by a factor Dr that can be written as\n\nDr \u00bc B ? sin\u00f0yl ? a\u00de (2.2)\n\nwhere B is the cross-track separation of the two phase centers, and yl and a represent\nthe look angle w.r.t. nadir and the orientation of the baseline with respect to the\n\nhorizontal direction, respectively. Note that, due to the curvature of Earth, the look\n\nFig. 2.2 Cross-track InSAR geometry. Band B? are the cross-track baseline and the normal\ncomponent, respectively. yl and y\n\n0\ni are the look and nominal incidence angle, respectively. H\n\nand h are the flight altitude of the satellites and the topographic height, respectively. The slant-\nrange distance of the two phase centers to the resolution cell is given by r1 and r2, and their\ndifference by Dr\n\n66 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nangle is smaller than the nominal incidence angley0i . For a given resolution cell, this\nrange difference is translated to an interferometric phase difference\n\nf \u00bc nw ? k0 ? Dr (2.3)\n\nwhere k0 is the wavenumber associated to the center frequency of the system and nw\nis 2 for the multi-monostatic case and 1 when the receivers share a common\n\ntransmitter. The power of interferometry results from the fact that the measurement\n\nof the interferometric phase allows estimating range differences with an accuracy of\n\nsmall fractions of a wavelength. This is typically several orders of magnitude better\n\nthan the range resolution of the radar.\n\nFor a given resolution cell, the interferometric phase can now be related to the\n\ntopographic height, h, with respect to a reference surface by\n\nf \u00bc nw ? k0 ? B ? sin\u00f0yl ? a\u00de ? B?\nr1 sin y\n\n0\ni\n\nh\n\n !\n(2.4)\n\nwhere B? is the nominal normal baseline component. The first term in (2.4) is a\nsystematic phase, while the second term reflects the interferometric sensitivity to\n\nheight, which is characterized by the vertical wavenumber\n\nkz \u00bc @f\n@h\n\n\u00bc nw ? k0 ? B?\nr1 ? sin y0i\n\n(2.5)\n\nor by the so-called height of ambiguity\n\nhamb \u00bc l ? r1 ? sin y\n0\ni\n\nnw ? B? ; (2.6)\n\nwhich is the change of topographic height that caused a phase difference of 2p.\nThese expressions show that the interferometric sensitivity to height and, there-\n\nfore, the final height resolution is proportional to the cross-track separation of the\n\ntwo receiving phase centers. There are three factors that impose an upper limit to\n\nthe cross-track interferometric baseline. Looking at a resolution cell with different\n\nincident angles introduces a so-called geometric decorrelation term, or spectral\n\nshift, between the interferometric pair [18]. This results from the fact that individual\n\nscatterers at different range positions within the resolution cell have different\n\ninterferometric phases. The baseline for which this interferometric phase\n\ndifferences reaches a full cycle is called the critical baseline\n\nB?; crit \u00bc 2 ? Brg ? l ? r1 ? tan\u00f0y\n0\ni ? z\u00de\n\nnwc0\n(2.7)\n\nwhere Brg is the transmit pulse bandwidth, and z is the local slope component in the\nground range direction. When the baseline reaches this critical value there is total\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 67\n\n\n\nloss of coherence. The impact of geometric decorrelation is limited by using\n\nbaselines that are small compared to the critical one. This can be achieved simply\n\nby choosing a small physical cross-track separation between the interferometric\n\nacquisitions, or by increasing the pulse bandwidth, i.e. the range resolution, of the\n\nsystem at the cost of increased data rate and reduced system sensitivity. Interfero-\n\nmetric SAR processing usually includes a common-band filtering step [18] that, in\n\nthe case of distributed targets on a more or less constant slope surface, eliminates\n\nthe decorrelating effect at the cost of a reduced range resolution.\n\nThe second limiting effect is volume decorrelation. Like in geometric\n\ndecorrelation, volume decorrelation happens due to the existence of scatterers\n\nwithin a resolution cell with different interferometric phases. The difference in\n\nthis case is that these scatterers may be located at exactly the same slant-range\n\ndistance from the reference phase center but at different elevation angles due to\n\ntheir different vertical positions. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.3 for the typical case of\n\na forest [19, 20].\n\nFor layered structures, the contribution of the volume decorrelation to the total\n\ninterferometric complex coherence is given by\n\ngvol \u00bc exp\u00f0 jkzz0\u00de\n\nRhV\n0\n\nF\u00f0z0\u00de exp\u00f0 jkzz0\u00dedz0\n\nRhV\n0\n\nF\u00f0z0\u00dedz0\n; (2.8)\n\nwhere F(z) represents the vertical scatterers distribution, hv is the volume height, j is\nthe square root of ?1, and z0 is the reference height. The first term in (2.8)\nrepresents the interferometric phase for a scattering center at the reference height.\n\nThe absolute value of this volumetric coherence term is always smaller or equal\n\nFig. 2.3 Illustration of\n\nvolume decorrelation in the\n\ncase of a forest. Since the tree\n\ncanopy is semi-transparent to\n\nradar waves, the received\n\nradar signal will contain\n\ncontributions of scattering\n\ncenters located at exactly the\n\nsame slant range but at\n\ndifferent elevations\n\n68 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nthan one. For smooth distributions, the magnitude of gvol tends to be a decreasing\nfunction of the kz ? hvproduct, while it may show an oscillatory behavior if vertical\ndiscontinuities or discrete layers are present. In contrast to geometric decorrelation,\n\nthe impact of volume decorrelation cannot be mitigated by improving the system\n\nresolution, nor can it be reduced using common-band filtering techniques. The only\n\nway to limit its impact is to have a height of ambiguity, hamb that is large in\ncomparison to the effective vertical spread of the scatterers.\n\nThe third limitation is the fact that the interferometric phase is wrapped modulo\n\n2p, meaning that two heights that differ by a multiple of the height of ambiguity\nproduce the same measured interferometric phase [21]. To resolve this ambiguity, a\n\nphase unwrapping step is required [22]. Phase unwrapping algorithms basically\n\nintegrate phase differences between pairs of pixels. Generally speaking, since these\n\nphase differences are also ambiguous, there is no unique solution, so phase\n\nunwrapping becomes a matter of finding the most likely solution. In order to\n\nminimize phase unwrapping errors, phase differences between pairs of pixels\n\nshould be smaller than half a cycle, which means that the height differences\n\nbetween those pixels should be smaller than half the height of ambiguity. It is\n\nworth noticing that these heights are always with respect to a reference surface,\n\nsince it\u2019s a priori-known topographic phase is usually subtracted from the measured\n\ninterferometric phase.\n\nAs an example, Fig. 2.4 shows the critical baseline and the normal baseline\n\ncorresponding to heights of ambiguity of 25, 50 and 100 m, respectively, as a\n\nfunction of incidence angle for an X-band system with 150 MHz pulse bandwidth\n\nand an orbital height of 550 km. As a reference, typical heights of ambiguity used\n\nFig. 2.4 Example of critical baseline and baselines corresponding to heights of ambiguity of 25,\n\n50 and 100 m, respectively, as a function of the incidence angle. An X-band system with 150 MHz\n\npulse bandwidth and an orbital height of 550 km has been considered\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 69\n\n\n\nfor the TanDEM-X mission are in the range from 25 to 50 m. The reason not to\n\nchoose larger baselines in this case, which would improve the topographic sensitiv-\n\nity, is to avoid phase unwrapping errors.\n\nOn top of the just discussed limitations on the cross-track baseline, there is also a\n\nlimitation on the along-track separation of the spacecraft in order to receive\n\ninterferometry-compatible echoes from a single transmitter. For any given target,\n\nthe instantaneous relative Doppler shift, i.e. the difference of Doppler shifts of the\n\nradar echoes received by each spacecraft, can be approximated as [1]\n\nDf D \u00bc\nvsat ? BAT\nl ? r ; (2.9)\n\nwhere vsat is the velocity of the spacecraft, BAT is the along-track separation (or\nalong-track baseline) and r is the mean slant range r \u00bc \u00f0r1 \u00fe r2\u00de=2. To determine if\nthis relative Doppler shift is significant, it must be compared to the available\n\nDoppler bandwidth. If the transmit and receive antenna have the same length (the\n\ntypical monostatic case) this available Doppler bandwidth can be approximated by\n\nBD; aval ? 2 ? vground\nL\n\n; (2.10)\n\nwhere vground is the ground velocity and L the antenna length. For unequal antennas,\nan approximation to the effective antenna length, Leff, is given by\n\nL2eff \u00bc\nL2tx \u00fe L2rx\n\n2\n: (2.11)\n\nNow, it is clear that in order to receive any signal the footprints of the transmit\n\nand receive antenna patterns must overlap, which requires defining an antenna\n\npointing strategy. The two most basic options are:\n\n\u2022 Maximum gain steering: in this case the receive beams are steered such that the\n\nmaxima of the transmit and receive antenna patterns point to the same point on\n\nthe ground. This maximizes the power content of each individual Doppler\n\nspectrum, but reduces the available common Doppler spectrum by DfD.\n\u2022 Maximum common Doppler steering: in this case the receive beams are steered\n\nin order to equalize the main-lobe of the Doppler spectrum. For a system with\n\nidentical transmit and receive antenna patterns (e.g. TanDEM-X), this is accom-\n\nplished by applying the same steering to both receive antennas.\n\nThe effect of an along-track separation on the Doppler spectra is illustrated in\n\nFig. 2.5, which shows the two-way antenna pattern parameterized as a function of\n\nDoppler (this can be directly interpreted as Doppler spectra) frequency for several\n\ncases. In all plots, the blue and red solid lines correspond to the maximum gain\n\noptimized master and slave patterns, respectively. The discontinuous lines corre-\n\nspond to the common-Doppler optimized patterns, with the 3-dB Doppler spectrum\n\nindicated by the thicker lines.\n\n70 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nThe first case (a) corresponds roughly to TanDEM-X for an along-track separa-\n\ntion of 2 km. Clearly, when both two-way patterns are optimized for gain, the result\n\nis a significant loss of common Doppler bandwidth (considering the 3-dB\n\nbandwidths). By applying an identical steering to both receive patterns, identical\n\nDoppler spectra are obtained. The cost, in this example, is a small two-way gain\n\nloss of roughly 0.5 dB. It is worth pointing out that for the case of TanDEM-X the\n\nsteering applied is simply the one-way total zero Doppler steering. The result is that\n\none of the patterns (the monostatic one) has a higher gain than the other (the bistatic\n\none), which is a slightly sub-optimal but simple and robust solution.\n\nThe second case (b) illustrates what happens ifBAT becomes too large (6 km in this\nTanDEM-X like scenario). Now the gain optimized spectra are totally non-\n\noverlapping and, therefore, useless for interferometry. For the common-Doppler\n\noptimized patternswe can observe: a considerable gain loss (roughly 5 dB); a reduced\n\n3-dB Doppler bandwidth; and a very large increase of side-lobe levels relative to the\n\nmain-lobe level that would result in much larger azimuth ambiguity levels.\n\nFig. 2.5 Examples of two-way antenna patterns as a function of the Doppler frequency. In all\n\ncases, the blue and red solid lines correspond to the maximum gain optimized master and slave\n\npatterns, respectively. The discontinuous lines correspond to the common-Doppler optimized\n\npatterns, with the 3-dB Doppler spectrum indicated by the thicker lines. (a) A TanDEM-X like\n\nsystem with BAT \u00bc 2 km. (b) Same as (a) but for BAT \u00bc 6 km. (c) Same as (a), but assuming a\nseparated independent transmitter 20 km ahead of the master receiver. (d) Same as (c), but\n\nreducing the receive antenna length to half its original size (2.25 m instead of 4.5 m)\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 71\n\n\n\nThe third case (c) considers a multistatic system consisting of a common\n\ntransmit spacecraft located 20 km ahead of the first of two receive-only satellites,\n\nwhich are themselves separated by BAT \u00bc 2 km. Otherwise the system\nspecifications are still roughly those of TanDEM-X. The transmit system is\n\nassumed to point at its zero Doppler. Both receive systems have a large common-\n\nmode steering so that the receive- and transmit-pattern footprints overlap, resulting\n\nin large Doppler centroids. Other than that, the resulting Doppler spectra are\n\nvirtually identical to those of the first example.\n\nThe last case (d) is similar to the previous one, with the important difference\n\nthat now the antenna length of the receiver (Lrx) has been cut in half, yielding a\n2.25 m long antenna instead of the original 4.5 m, which is reflected in the wider\n\ngain optimized two-way patterns. Different from all previous cases, and in order to\n\nachieve equal Doppler spectra, it is necessary to apply significantly different squint\n\nangles to each receive antenna: in this particular case this squint difference was\n\n0.3?, which is almost as large as the one-way transmit 3-dB beamwidth. This\nresults in degraded side-lobes and in a considerable gain loss (roughly 2 dB,\n\nwhich is much worse than the 0.5 dB of the reference case). Also, most of the\n\n3-dB main-lobe of the common-Doppler optimized spectrum is below the\n\ngain-optimized spectra. This suggests that, in this particular case, the global\n\ninterferometric performance would be better for gain-optimized patterns than for\n\ncommon-Doppler optimized ones, and that there must be some globally optimum\n\nin-between solution.\n\nTo achieve single-pass baselines in the order of hundreds of meters, as in the\n\nprevious example, a formation-flying multistatic system is the only viable option.\n\nSince the required baselines scale with the wavelength, this distributed mission\n\nsolution becomes even more attractive as lower frequencies are used. For example,\n\nin the Tandem-L mission proposal baselines of several km are required to achieve\n\nthe mission objectives.\n\nBesides achieving the desired large baselines, a distributed system allows\n\nmodifying this baseline during the mission. For example, a smaller baseline may\n\nbe used during a first phase of a topographic mission in order to obtain a first\n\niteration of a DEM without suffering from phase unwrapping problems. In a second\n\nphase, the use of a larger baseline will then allow the refinement of this DEM. Such\n\na strategy has been employed for TanDEM-X (cf. Chap. 13).\n\n2.2.2 Multi-Baseline Cross-Track Interferometry\n\nFrom the discussion in the previous section, it should be intuitively clear that a\n\nmulti-baseline single-pass cross-track interferometric system could add significant\n\nvalue with respect to a single baseline configuration such as implemented in the\n\nTanDEM-X mission. While the simplest approach is to iteratively process\n\ninterferograms with decreasing height of ambiguities, there are a number of\n\napproaches that directly combine all the available information. This allows the\n\n72 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_13\n\n\nunambiguous estimation of the topography from a set of SAR images that taken\n\npair-wise would in all cases suffer from unsolvable ambiguities.\n\nSome of these techniques evaluate the phase increments between adjacent pixels\n\nin multiple co-registered interferograms, thereby taking advantage of the determin-\n\nistic relation between the baseline length and the phase gradient [23]. Other\n\ntechniques resolve height ambiguities independently for each pixel [24], e.g. in\n\nan Earth based coordinate system by using a maximum likelihood approach [25].\n\nThis offers the opportunity to fuse multiple height estimates acquired in completely\n\ndifferent imaging geometries, but requires also a precise knowledge of the remain-\n\nder phase (more precisely: remainder topographic height) for each interferometric\n\nimage pair. Still other techniques regard height determination as a direction of\n\narrival (DOA) estimation in a sparse array and apply e.g. model based spectral\n\nestimation techniques to fuse the information from multiple SAR images in an\n\nunambiguous height estimate [26]. Interferometric acquisitions with large baselines\n\nmay also use a joint multi-channel processing to minimize deteriorations from slope\n\ndependent baseline decorrelation [27].\n\n2.2.3 Polarimetric SAR Interferometry\n\nThe combination of InSAR with SAR Polarimetry [28, 29] results in Polarimetric\n\nSAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) [30, 31]. In PolInSAR the capability of SAR\n\nPolarimetry to separate scatterers by their polarimetric signature is combined\n\nwith the capability to measure height, via the direction of arrival in elevation\n\nestimation, provided by cross-track InSAR. For example, in the case of a forest,\n\nthe canopy will generate a cross-polar contribution in the radar echo that is\n\nassociated to volume scatterers. In contrast, the ground return will show the\n\npolarimetric signature of single-bounce scattering, associated to rough surfaces,\n\nand double bounce scattering, associated to the dihedrals formed by the trunks and\n\nthe ground.\n\nAs suggested by this example, one of the primary applications of PolInSAR is\n\nthe estimation of vegetation heights. It is worth noting that this inversion is,\n\ngenerally speaking, non-trivial. In addition, in many cases, for example forests\n\nobserved at C-, X-band, or higher frequencies, the attenuation of the signal by the\n\ncanopy is so large that the contribution of the ground return is below the noise floor.\n\nIn practice, PolInSAR inversion algorithms extract the desired information from\n\nthe estimated multi-channel (6 ? 6) covariance matrices, which are estimated by\nspatially averaging over a region that is assumed to be homogeneous. The inversion\n\nin order to obtain, for example, forest height, is done using an assumed layered\n\nmodel for which the expected covariance matrix can be derived analytically. The\n\nsimplest (and most robust) model is the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) [20,\n\n32] model, which assumes that a forest can be modelled as a homogeneous layer of\n\nvolume scatterers of a given thickness at some distance of a homogeneous ground.\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 73\n\n\n\nPolInSAR inversion can greatly benefit from a multi-baseline scenario [33].\n\nFirst, different baselines will be optimal for single-baseline inversion for different\n\nvegetation heights. Second, the availability of multiple baselines can allow\n\nestimating vertical profiles more complex than a simple RVoG. These profiles\n\ncan be described, for example, by a truncated Legendre series and, therefore,\n\nparameterized by a small number of coefficients [34]. Three or four baselines\n\nseem sufficient to accurately retrieve the mean vertical profile.\n\n2.2.4 SAR Tomography\n\nA natural extension to SAR interferometry is SAR tomography [35\u201338]. In SAR\n\ntomography, a number of acquisitions from (slightly) different cross-track positions\n\nare treated conceptually as a sparse array, allowing the discrimination of signal\n\ncontributions (radar echoes) corresponding to the same slant-range and azimuth\n\npositions by their direction of arrival in elevation. SAR tomography allows real 3-D\n\nimaging of semi-transparent volume scatterers, and can be applied to retrieve the\n\nvertical structure of, for example, forests, dry soil, or ice.\n\nThe SAR tomography concept is also useful for non-transparent scatterers,\n\nwhere it allows to resolve geometric distortions inherent to SAR imaging such as\n\nforeshortening and, in particular, layover [39, 40]. The problem of layover is that\n\ntargets at different ground range distance from the sensor, but with different\n\nheights, may be at the same slant-range distance of the SAR system. This requires\n\nslopes larger than the incidence angle. Layover effects are ubiquitous in the case of\n\nman-made targets, as illustrated in the example in Fig. 2.6. In this case, scatterers on\n\nFig. 2.6 Illustration of a\n\nlayover situation: scatterers\n\non the roof of the building\n\nwill appear on the same range\n\nresolution cell in the SAR\n\nimage as the car. Since both\n\nscattering centers are located\n\nat a different elevation angle\n\nw.r.t. the radar, they can be\n\ndiscriminated using array\n\nprocessing if many\n\nsimultaneous acquisitions\n\nfrom slightly different\n\npositions are available\n\n74 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nthe roof of a building would appear in the same position as the car that is situated at\n\nground level, but at a smaller ground range distance from the radar. The roof-top\n\nand the car would contribute to the same resolution cell (pixel) in the resulting SAR\n\nimage. Since single-baseline interferometry assumes implicitly a model with a\n\nsingle effective scattering center to which a unique height can be attributed, it is\n\nclear that in the case of layover the phase to height conversion will yield an\n\nincorrect result. With more than two phased centers, array processing techniques\n\n(also known as beamforming techniques) can be used to separate the contribution of\n\nboth targets, and to correctly position each of them.\n\nSAR tomography from space has been demonstrated already by a number of\n\nauthors [37, 41] using series of repeat-pass acquisitions. Like in interferometric\n\napplications, temporal decorrelation becomes a major challenge, in particular if\n\nmultiple acquisitions are required to construct the tomographic data set. This\n\nrestricts its applicability to scenes with very long coherence times, for example\n\nurban areas or natural scenarios observed at very low frequencies (e.g. at P-band).\n\nAside from temporal decorrelation, which can be eliminated in a single-pass\n\nmultistatic configuration, the second challenge is the distribution of the phase\n\ncenters. The ideal tomographic configuration is the one where the different effec-\n\ntive phase centers are distributed uniformly in elevation, therefore regularly sam-\n\npling the elevation signature of the radar signal. The optimum spacing between\n\nthese phase centers can be derived from Nyquist sampling theory. For this, the\n\nsignal received for echoes at a slant-range distance r, as a function of the effective\nnormal baseline, B?, with respect to some reference position can be written as\n\nsr\u00f0B?; r\u00de \u00bc C0\n\u00f0\ng\u00f0r; yi\u00dee?jnwk0B? sin\u00f0yi?y\n\n0\ni \u00dedyi; (2.12)\n\nwhere g\u00f0?\u00de represents the complex reflectivity function that characterizes a given\npoint in space, and C0 groups all remaining terms that affect the amplitude of the\nreceived signal. Parameterizing the position as a function of height, using (2.5) in\n\norder to use kz instead ofB?, and dropping the explicit dependence from R yields the\nfollowing relation\n\nsr\u00f0kz\u00de \u00bc C1\n\u00f0\ng\u00f0h\u00dee?jkzhdh; ss (2.13)\n\nwhere the new constant C1 includes the scaling due to the variable change.\nThis result shows a Fourier transform relationship between the received signal (as\n\na function of the baseline/tomographic dimension) and the complex reflectivity (as a\n\nfunction of height). For a volume with effective thickness hv, which can now be\ninterpreted as a bandwidth, the normal baseline between adjacent acquisitions that\n\nmeets Nyquist\u2019s sampling criterion is given by [42]\n\nDkz ? 2p\nhv\n\n: (2.14)\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 75\n\n\n\nIn terms of the minimum cross-track normal baseline, this means\n\nb?;min ? l ? r ? sin y\n0\ni\n\nnw ? hv : (2.15)\n\nThe vertical resolution is given by the length of the tomographic aperture. Thus,\n\nfor a target resolution Dh, the maximum baseline must be such that\n\nkz;max ? 2pDh ; (2.16)\n\nor, in terms of baseline,\n\nb?;max ? l ? r ? sin y\n0\ni\n\nnw ? Dh : (2.17)\n\nCombining these results, it is easy to see that the number of effective phase\n\ncenters in a canonical tomographic configuration is given by\n\nNtomo \u00bc hvDh ; (2.18)\n\nwhich is an intuitively satisfactory result stating that the number of tomographic\n\nsamples should be equal to the number of independent tomographic resolution cells\n\nin the resulting volumetric image. From the system designer point of view, how-\n\never, this result may easily lead to an unrealistic number of phase centers. It is worth\n\nstressing the point that the number of tomographic samples is not restricted to the\n\nnumber of receivers. Instead, it is given by the number of unique combinations\n\nbetween transmitter and receiver.\n\n2.2.5 Sparse Tomography\n\nThe previous discussion suggests that a useful multistatic system capable of single-\n\npass tomography requires a complex constellation with many spacecraft. It is\n\nobvious that this canonical solution has many drawbacks:\n\n\u2022 High costs associated to such a system, even though the receiving systems could\n\nbe low cost and compact, with little or no redundancy, and with unit costs\n\nreduced thanks to small series production.\n\n\u2022 Data management. On-board data storage and data down-link capacity are\n\nalready critical design constraints for single-satellite radar systems. A tomo-\n\ngraphic system with N effective phase centers will multiply this problem by the\nsame factor N. The reader should note that this problem is not relaxed using a\nmultiple active configuration.\n\n76 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Formation design and control. A single-pass tomographic system requires a\n\nformation that provides the desired cross-track baselines with a relatively\n\nsmall along-track separation (to keep Doppler Centroid compatibility). While\n\narbitrarily complex formations can be designed that fulfil these requirements, the\n\naddition of each new satellite tightens the formation control requirements and\n\nreduces safety margins.\n\nIn light of these issues, it is clear that solutions requiring less phase centers are\n\ndesired. Fortunately, SAR tomography literature already offers a variety of\n\nprocessing approaches to handle these sparse scenarios using sparse array processing\n\ntechniques [42\u201344]. The basic idea behind these methods is the assumption that there\n\nare only a few dominant scattering centers, which can be understood either as point-\n\nlike scatterers (typical of urban environments) or as distributed volume scatterers\n\nspanning an angle smaller than the tomographic resolution of the system. Experi-\n\nmental studies suggest that, indeed, the number of tomographically separable scatter-\n\ning centers, Nscat, is typically below 3\u20135 [45]. This is in particular true for high\nresolution SAR systems.\n\nIf the number of scattering centers is known, then the tomographic imaging can\n\nbe done using subspace methods such as the MUSIC algorithm or, in a brute force\n\napproach, finding the Non-linear Least Square (NLS) error solution (i.e. directly\n\ninverting a possibly over determined non-linear problem) [46]. For these\n\napproaches, a main challenge is to determine the number of relevant phase centers,\n\nwhich can be done using a priori knowledge or using information-theoretic criteria.\n\nFor example several authors [35, 46] suggest using the Akaide Information Criterion\n\n(AIC) [47] to estimate the dimension (e.g. number of scatterers) of the tomographic\n\ndata set. If the number of scatterers is known or can be robustly determined, then the\n\nnumber of required tomographic phase centers is lower bounded by\n\nNtomo ? Nscat \u00fe 1: (2.19)\nAnother promising tomographic processing approach uses the Compressive\n\nSensing (CS) paradigm [43\u201345]. CS-based algorithms are capable of providing\n\nsuper-resolution in the tomographic dimension, i.e. a vertical resolution for a given\n\nmaximum baseline that is better than the one given by (2.17), with a reduced\n\nnumber of measurements and without a priori knowledge of the number of\n\nscatterers. The number of required phase centers depends on the number of tomo-\n\ngraphic resolution cells, the number of scatterers, and the SNR. For 3\u20135 scatterers it\n\nappears that 15 phase centers (Ntomo \u00bc 15) provide robust performance.\n\n2.2.6 Along-Track Interferometry and Moving Target Indication\n\nThe basic idea behind along-track interferometry [22, 48\u201351] (ATI) is the repeated\n\nobservation of a scene under nearly identical geometry with a given temporal lag,\n\ntATI. If a target is moving and this movement has a non-zero component in the\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 77\n\n\n\nline-of-sight (LOS) direction, the resulting change of the slant-range will result in\n\nan interferometric phase\n\nfATI \u00bc 2k0 ? \u00f0vtarget ? rLOS\u00de ? tATI; (2.20)\n\nwhere vtargetrepresents the target\u2019s velocity vector, and rLOSthe line-of-sight vector\n\nfrom the center of the synthetic aperture to the target. Since the interferometric\n\nphase is wrapped modulo 2p, it is generally desirable that the ATI phase is\nconstrained to the interval [?p, p]. Considering the range of velocities to be\ncovered, this can directly yield the order of magnitude of the desired temporal\n\nlag. For very slow movements, for example those associated to terrain subsidence,\n\nthese temporal scales are in the order of days to months, or even years. These scales\n\nare addressed by means of repeat-pass interferometry: repeated observations made\n\nby different passes of a single spacecraft. For large velocities, such as those of\n\nvehicles or ocean currents, these scales are typically in the order of milliseconds to\n\ntenths of seconds. This is the realm of along-track interferometry, requiring two\n\nacquisitions in a single pass by means of two along-track separated phase centers.\n\nTemporal lag and along-track separation or baseline, BAT, are related by\n\ntATI \u00bc nw ? BAT\n2 ? vsat ; (2.21)\n\nwhere BAT is the physical separation between the phase centers. Typically, ATI\nsystems use a common transmitter, so that nw \u00bc 1. The term BAT/2 is then the\neffective along-track baseline between the equivalent bistatic phase centers.\n\nAnalogous to the height of ambiguity in XTI, it is useful to define an unambigu-\n\nous velocity range, vamb, which results from setting the ATI phase to 2p, and\nsolving for the velocity.\n\nFigure 2.7 shows the horizontal unambiguous velocity range as a function of\n\nalong-track baseline for L-, C-, X- and Ka-band. For ground moving targets, these\n\nhorizontal velocities can reach around 50 m/s or more (high speed trains, cars on\n\nhighways), making vamb in the order of 100 m/s a reasonable design goal. The\nassociated baselines are relatively small, for example, around 10 m at C-band and\n\n5 m at X-band. These short scales are in principle not well suited for a distributed\n\nsystem, calling instead for single platform solutions such as the Dual Receive\n\nAntenna (DRA) available in TerraSAR-X.\n\nInstead, a multistatic ATI system is ideally suited for ocean currents and other\n\ngeophysical phenomena resulting in velocities in the order of 1 m/s. For the case of\n\nocean currents, there is an additional effect that needs to be taken into account when\n\nconsidering the optimal along-track baseline: temporal decorrelation of the surface.\n\nInSAR assumes that the target being observed is the same for all the acquisitions.\n\nSince the ocean surface is constantly changing, the assumption its radar scattering\n\ncoefficient does not change is only valid for a short period of time. There is\n\ntherefore a trade-off between the long baseline desired to maximize the ATI\n\nsensitivity, and the short baseline needed to maintain coherence between\n\n78 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nacquisitions. This will be discussed in some detail in Sect. 2.4.3, in the context of\n\nthe PICOSAR mission concept.\n\n2.2.7 Geometric and Radiometric Resolution Enhancement\n\nIn the previous sub-sections we have discussed applications in which multiple\n\nreceivers are used to add an additional dimension to the data: for each resolution\n\ncell we now have two or more channels available. The next two sub-sections\n\ndiscuss the use of distributed multistatic systems to improve the quality of, or\n\nextend, the single-channel SAR images. The goal, therefore, is to use a distributed\n\nsystem, typically comprised of relatively small spacecraft, to synthesize the equiv-\n\nalent to a much larger SAR system.\n\nOne of the main effects hindering the interpretation of SAR data is the presence of\n\nmultiplicative speckle noise [52\u201354]. The result is that the radar cross section\nmeasured for a resolution cell containing multiple scattering centers is essentially a\n\nrandom variable which, in the case of fully distributed scatterers, follows an expo-\n\nnential distribution (for which the standard deviation equals the mean value). To\n\nobtain reliable estimates of the true radar cross section, or the normalized radar cross\n\nsection, some sort of averaging is required. For single acquisitions using a single-\n\nchannel system, this averaging is done in the spatial domain, by averaging a number\n\nof neighboring pixels, or, equivalently, by dividing the SAR image in sub-bands in\n\nthe Doppler frequency domain and/or in the fast-time frequency domain and then\n\nFig. 2.7 Horizontal velocity of ambiguity as a function of the along-track baseline (BAT) for\nL-, C-, X- and Ka-band\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 79\n\n\n\naveraging the powers of the sub-band SAR images. The result of this multi-looking\n\nprocess is a better estimate of the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) at the\n\ncost of a reduced product resolution. Also, multi-looking assumes implicitly that\n\nthe scene can be considered homogenous over the averaged pixels. The monostatic\n\napproach to achieve high spatial and good radiometric resolution is to increase the\n\nsingle-look resolution of the system. One approach is to increase the transmitted\n\npulse bandwidth, which is legally upper limited by spectrum allocation regulations,\n\nand which requires a proportional increase of the transmit power in order to maintain\n\nsensitivity. The second approach is to increase the Doppler bandwidth, which also\n\nrequires an increase in the transmit power.\n\nAn alternative way to increase the resolution (and the number of available looks)\n\nis to combine acquisitions that sample different parts of the spectrum [55, 56]\n\n(Fig. 2.8). In the Doppler domain this requires acquiring images with different\n\nDoppler centroids: while the common parts of the Doppler spectra yield interfero-\n\nmetric information, the non-overlapping parts can be used to increase the azimuth\n\nresolution. As discussed already in Sect. 2.2.1 (see Fig. 2.5), a set of passive along-\n\ntrack separated receivers will naturally yield a Doppler centroid difference. From a\n\npower budget point of view, this is a very appealing way to gain resolution because\n\nit does not require broadening the transmit beam, like in a monostatic system, so the\n\nadditional resolution does not require additional transmit power. If the primary goal\n\nis to increase the resolution, then the different multistatic images need to be\n\nFig. 2.8 Super-resolution\n\nwith a passive microsatellite\n\nformation. A coherent\n\ncombination of the spectra\n\nobtained from slightly\n\ndifferent view angles will\n\nallow for an improved\n\nresolution in range and/or\n\nazimuth\n\n80 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\ncoherent and the aggregated Doppler spectrum must be continuous. However, if the\n\npurpose is multi-looking, both of these requirements may be dropped.\n\nSuper-resolution can also be achieved in the range domain. Ground range\n\nresolution is determined by the portion of the ground spectrum (in the wavenumber\n\ndomain) sampled by the radar pulse. The ground range wavenumber, ky, is related\nto the slant range frequency by [18]\n\nky \u00bc 2 ? k ? sin\u00f0y0i ? z\u00de \u00bc\n4pf\nc0\n\nsin\u00f0y0i ? z\u00de; (2.22)\n\nwhere, as before, y0i is the nominal incidence angle and zis the terrain slope. For a\nsingle SAR system, the ground range resolution is given by\n\nDy \u00bc 2p\nDky\n\n\u00bc c0\n2 ? Df ? sin\u00f0y? z\u00de ; (2.23)\n\nwhereDf is the pulse bandwidth, and c0 the speed of light. From (2.22) it is clear that\nchanging the incidence angle will change the ground range wavenumber, so SAR\n\nimages acquired with a different incidence angle, which results from having a cross-\n\ntrack baseline can be combined into a single higher resolution image. Again, a\n\nmultistatic constellation with a set of cross-track separated receivers, would allow\n\nachieving this range super-resolution without increasing the transmit power. Also,\n\nas before, for the sake of multi-looking it is not necessary to coherently combine the\n\ndifferent images, which also allows baselines well above the critical one.\n\nIt is maybe worth noting that while the combination of different portions of the\n\nDoppler spectrum is a natural extension of the synthetic aperture concept, and can\n\nbe understood as an optical imaging process, super-resolution in ground range is a\n\nmixture of slant range resolution with angular resolution. This combination is less\n\nnatural and more prone to problems. For example, a good knowledge of the terrain\n\nslopes is required.\n\n2.2.8 Unambiguous Wide-Swath Imaging\n\nThe last application that will be discussed here is the use of a multistatic configura-\n\ntion to achieve High-Resolution Wide-Swath (HRWS) SAR imaging. One of the\n\ntraditional limitations of single-channel SAR systems is the relation between\n\nresolution, swath width, and antenna size. The requirement for a high strip-map\n\nmode azimuth resolution implies a large Doppler bandwidth, traditionally implying\n\na short antenna (since the best achievable strip-map resolution can be approximated\n\nby L/2 where L is the antenna length), which in turn requires a high PRF to avoid\nazimuth ambiguities. The high PRF implies a narrow unambiguous swath, which\n\nmeans that a wide antenna is needed in order to provide the narrow beam in\n\nelevation required to suppress range ambiguities. Aside from the resulting tradeoff\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 81\n\n\n\nbetween azimuth resolution and swath width, this argumentation suggests a lower\n\nbound on the antenna area, which indeed is reported in many SAR references\n\n[57, 58]. This bound is given by\n\nA \u00bc W ? L > 4 ? vsat ? l ? rm\nc0\n\ntan y0i;m; (2.24)\n\nwhere A is the total antenna area, W is the antenna width, and rm and y\n0\ni;m are the\n\nslant range and the nominal incidence angle at the center of the swath, respectively.\n\nAlthough this lower bound can be relaxed if a resolution worse than L/2 is accepted,\nwhich allows lowering the PRF, or if a swath width smaller than the unambiguous\n\nswath is allowed [59], it is a good starting point for a system design.\n\nFor single-channel systems, given an antenna area, azimuth resolution may be\n\ntraded off against swath width using burst modes like ScanSAR or TOPS (Terrain\n\nObservation by Progressive Scans) [60]. In this trade off, the amount of indepen-\n\ndent resolution cells per azimuth unit length remains, at best,1 constant. Azimuth\n\nresolution can be improved using Spotlight modes, limiting the continuous scene\n\nlength. Here again the average information rate remains constant, since azimuth\n\nSAR image segments with increased information density are followed by segments\n\nfor which no information can be acquired.\n\nWhile the minimum area bound cannot really be overcome without performance\n\ndegradation, azimuth resolution can be decoupled from swath width by introducing\n\nmultiple channels and applying digital beamforming (DBF) techniques [61\u201363].\n\nFrom an intuitive point of view, it seems plausible that increasing the number of\n\nsamples acquired by a SAR system will increase the number of independent pixels in\n\nthe resulting SAR image, either by improving its resolution, or by increasing its\n\nextent. DBF SAR systems use one, or a combination, of the following two principles:\n\n\u2022 An array of receivers in the along-track direction allows reducing the PRF\n\nrequired to sample a given Doppler bandwidth. From a beamforming point of\n\nview, this is accomplished by generating a number of narrow receive beams in\n\nazimuth. From Nyquist sampling theory it follows that the narrower Doppler\n\nbandwidth associated to these narrow beams allows a lower PRF. An alternative\n\nway of understanding the reconstruction process is the following: for each\n\nreceiver an independent image may be formed which, due to the low PRF, will\n\nsuffer from high azimuth ambiguities. Then, these images are combined using\n\nDBF methods that will place nulls at the positions of these ambiguities.\n\n\u2022 An array of receivers in the cross-track direction allows discriminating echoes\n\nfrom different range directions by their direction of arrival. This allows the\n\nsimultaneous acquisition of a number of strip-map sub-swaths. Here again, the\n\nkey of DBF is the capacity to place zeroes at the range ambiguities.\n\n1 Usually there are unavoidable gaps between the modes which means that the independent pixel\n\ncount goes down with respect to strip-map.\n\n82 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nDBF SAR techniques will play an important part in future and at time of writing\n\nplanned monostatic missions. But they can also be implemented in a distributed\n\nmultistatic mission concept [64\u201367]. The idea is that instead of requiring a large and\n\ncomplex system, a multi-channel receiver may be distributed in a number of small\n\nspacecraft.\n\nAside from the obvious implementation differences, the main conceptual differ-\n\nence between a single spacecraft DBF system and its distributed, multistatic counter-\n\npart, is that in the first case we are dealing with an array of optimally and regularly\n\nspaced elements, while in the secondwe have amore or less random sparse array. For\n\nregular dense arraysDBF can be implemented usingmatched filter based approaches.\n\nFor sparse arrays, however, a matched filter may have large side-lobes at the\n\nlocations of the ambiguities that need to be suppressed. One possible solution is to\n\nuse a Maximum Likelihood (ML) beamformer, which, in the case of white additive\n\nnoise, basically pseudo-inverts the received signal, placing nulls at the ambiguities\n\n[67]. Although ML-based DBF gives the best possible performance in terms of\n\nSignal-to-Clutter (ambiguities) Ratio (SCR), depending on the positions of the\n\nreceivers the pseudo-inverse problem may become ill-conditioned, which in\n\nthe presence of noise can result in the appearance of large imaging artifacts.\n\nAn alternative processing approach is the use of Minimum Mean Square Error\n\n(MMSE) estimator DBF. Note that although MMSE will avoid the introduction of\n\nlarge noise induced artifacts, it does not really solve the problem. At positions where\n\nthe ML estimator would generate a large artifact, the MMSE estimator will put a\n\nvalue based on the a priori assumed scene statistics and not on the measurement. The\n\nreal solution is to over-dimension the system by introducing extra receiving\n\nelements in order to decrease the probability of having an ill-conditioned problem.\n\nAnother problem associated to sparse arrays is that the large separation between\n\nelementsmakes themvery sensitive to phase errors, which is a particular issue forML\n\nor MMSE processing approaches. This means that very precise phase synchroniza-\n\ntion/calibration is required between the multiple receivers, something that is already\n\ngenerally complicated in a multistatic context. All together, the appeal of using a\n\ndistributed system forHRWS imaging is that the systemmay be used at the same time\n\nfor some of the previously discussed interferometric or tomographic applications.\n\n2.3 Mission Design\n\n2.3.1 Formation Selection\n\nThe multistatic systems and applications considered in this chapter assume a\n\nconstellation of formation flying spacecraft. In this section several formation\n\nconcepts will be discussed. In general, an important design goal is to have well\n\ncontrolled and more or less constant baselines between the spacecraft. For\n\nalong-track interferometry this can be accomplished by placing the spacecraft on\n\nthe same orbital plane and with the same orbital parameters but with a small\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 83\n\n\n\nalong-track separation. For this kind of configuration the only, but important\n\nproblem, is dealing with random orbital drifts that, if not taken care of, could lead\n\nto a collision between the spacecraft.\n\nHowever, such a simple solution is not possible in the case of cross-track\n\ninterferometry since neither the vertical nor the horizontal cross-track separations\n\nremain constant for free-flying satellites on natural orbits, which are necessary to\n\nkeep the fuel consumption within reasonable limits. The relative motion of free-\n\nmoving satellites in close formation may be approximated by Hill\u2019s equations [68],\n\nalso known as Clohessy-Wiltshire equations [69], which describe the satellite\n\nmovements in a rotating reference frame [70]. This transformation allows a lineari-\n\nzation of the differential equations characterizing the satellite dynamics. For unper-\n\nturbed, Keplerian motion and a circular reference orbit with period T0, a solution of\nthe Clohessy-Wiltshire equations is given by [71, 72]\n\nDrr\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ?a ? dei cos 2p\nT0\n\nt? ai\n? ?\n\nDrt\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 2a ? dei sin 2p\nT0\n\nt? ai\n? ?\n\n\u00fe a ? Dui;\n\nDrn\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc a ? dii sin 2p\nT0\n\nt? bi\n? ? (2.25)\n\nwhere a is the semi-major axis, Dui the relative argument of latitude of satellite i,\nand the magnitude dei together with the angle ai and the magnitude dii together with\nthe anglebi define the so called relative inclination and relative eccentricity vectors,\nrespectively. The variables Drr, Drt, and Drn, represent the relative position of\nsatellite in the radial (vertical) direction, the direction of movement (along-track),\n\nand the cross-plane direction (horizontal across-track), respectively. The term aDu\nintroduces a constant along-track offset. The first two equations describe an ellipse\n\nin the (nominal) orbital plane, yielding a harmonic vertical cross-track baseline\n\noscillation and a 90? out of phase harmonic along-track baseline oscillation with\ntwice the amplitude. The last term introduces an independent harmonic oscillation\n\nin the cross-plane direction.\n\n2.3.1.1 Interferometric Cartwheel\n\nOne of the first and best known suggested multistatic configurations is the Interfero-\n\nmetric Cartwheel suggested by Massonet in 1998 [5, 73]. The Cartwheel formation\n\nconsists of a set of receive-only microsatellites flying in close formation on the same\n\norbital plane along slightly elliptical orbits. In its basic configuration, all satellites\n\nhave the same eccentricity and the same semi-major axis, i.e. dei \u00bc de in Hill\u2019s\nequations. Since all satellites share the same orbital plane (dii \u00bc 0), the horizontal\ncross-track displacement, Drn, vanishes for all orbital positions. To obtain the\ninterferometric baselines, the arguments of perigee differ between the satellites,\n\n84 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nleading to a relative phase shift between the radial componentsDrr(t) due to different\nai. For example, a Cartwheel with three satellites will have relative phase shifts\n\na3 ? a2 \u00bc a2 ? a1 \u00bc 120?: (2.26)\n\nThe upper panel in Fig. 2.9 shows an example of Drr (vertical axis) and Drn\n(which is always zero) for this kind of 3-spacecraft configuration for a\u00b7de \u00bc 450 m.\n\nFig. 2.9 (a) Relative cross-track deviations with respect to mean (nominal) orbit for a 3-\n\nspacecraft Interferometric Cartwheel as a function of the mean argument of latitude (u). There\n\nare no deviations in direction normal to the common orbital plane. (b) Resulting effective cross-\n\ntrack (top) and along-track baselines (bottom)\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 85\n\n\n\nNote that, as long as there are no uncompensated along-track relative drifts with\n\nrespect to the nominal formation, the 90? out-of-phase Drt ensures that the space-\ncraft do not collide.\n\nThe lower panel shows the norms of the effective cross-track and along-track\n\nbaselines for each combination of spacecraft. It also shows (blue thick line) the\n\nvertical baseline envelope (maximum of the three baselines) and the corresponding\n\nalong-track baselines. A remarkable feature of this configuration is that the maxi-\n\nmum baseline is very stable along the orbit, with the smallest value only 13% below\n\nthe largest. Another desirable feature is that these maximum cross-track baselines\n\nappear always in combination with minimum along-track baselines.\n\nThe Interferometric Cartwheel assumes a separated transmit satellite. In fact, it\n\nwas proposed as a passive add-on formation to existing or planned monostatic\n\nmissions that would operate without any impact on the primary system.\n\n2.3.1.2 Cross-Track Pendulum\n\nThe cross-track Pendulum is another three passive spacecraft formation concept\n\nwhich can be understood as the complement (or opposite) to the Cartwheel. Instead\n\nof using slightly elliptic orbits and adjusting the argument of perigee, in the\n\nPendulum configuration what changes is the orbital plane, either by changing the\n\norbital inclination and/or the ascending nodes. Thus, for the Pendulum dei \u00bc 0, so\nthat the along-track separation, according to (2.25), is nominally always constant.\n\nNote that this forces setting and maintaining different Du values for each spacecraft,\nin order to avoid collisions. Figure 2.10 illustrates a Pendulum configuration with\n\nb3 ? b2 \u00bc b2 ? b1 \u00bc 120?: (2.27)\n\nTo follow the previous example, the amplitude of the harmonic oscillation is set\n\nby a\u00b7di \u00bc 250 m. The cross-track baseline follows the same behavior as for the\nInterferometric Cartwheel, with a very constant envelope, but with the difference\n\nthat in this case the baselines are horizontal. For incidence angles smaller than\n\nabout 52?, a horizontal baseline gives a larger effective baseline than a vertical one,\nwhich means that, generally speaking, a Pendulum configuration would require\n\nsmaller relative motions than its Cartwheel counterpart.\n\nSince the along-track baselines are constant, the one associated to the largest\n\ncross-track baseline jumps between two values in this example where the three\n\nspacecraft were uniformly distributed with 200 m along-track separation between\n\nconsecutive ones. The minimum spacing has to be large enough to guarantee forma-\n\ntion safety even in the event that one or more spacecraft have to go into save mode.\n\nA disadvantage of this three satellite Pendulum configuration is that it requires\n\nthat the satellites have slightly different inclinations, which means that their slightly\n\ndifferent orbital planes will have slightly different precession rates. In particular, at\n\nmost one of the spacecraft can have the exact inclination required to achieve a\n\nfrozen Sun-synchronous orbit, as required for most SAR missions. This requires\n\n86 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nsome extra fuel for formation keeping. This last problem can be avoided by using a\n\nso-called Trinodal Pendulum formation in which the three satellites have the same\n\ninclination and eccentricity but different ascending nodes. This leads to a constant\n\nbaseline ratio, which is of interest for multi-baseline applications. The drawback is\n\nthat all the XTI baselines tend to vanish at high latitudes.\n\nFig. 2.10 (a) Relative cross-track deviations with respect to mean (nominal) orbit for a\n\n3-spacecraft cross-track Pendulum as a function of the mean argument of latitude (u). (b) Resulting\n\neffective cross-track and along-track baselines\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 87\n\n\n\n2.3.1.3 CarPe\n\nThe Cartwheel and the Cross-track Pendulum concepts can be combined in a CarPe\n\nconfiguration. In this case two spacecraft can have a slightly different ascending\n\nnode (but identical inclination), and the third one has a small relative eccentricity\n\nand argument of perigee that maximizes the deviation from the reference orbit\n\nwhen the other two spacecraft have a vanishing cross-track separation:\n\nb1 \u00bc 90?;b2 \u00bc 270?\na3 \u00bc 90? : (2.28)\n\nFigure 2.11 shows an example with a\u00b7di1 \u00bc a\u00b7di2 \u00bc 450 m and a\u00b7de3 \u00bc 650 m.\nThese numbers have been chosen semi-arbitrarily so that the vertical and horizontal\n\nbaselines result in similar effective cross-track baselines. This effective baseline,\n\nhowever, will depend on the incidence angle. This means that, except for a nominal\n\nincidence angle, the envelope of the effective baseline will have larger variations\n\nthan the Cartwheel or the Pendulum configurations. This is illustrated in the bottom\n\npanel of the figure, for an incidence angle of 45?, which corresponds to a 40.5? look\nangle for an orbit height of 550 km.\n\nThe advantage of a CarPe formation with respect to a Cartwheel is that it\n\ncombines a quite stable cross-track effective baseline envelope with one constant\n\nalong-track baseline, which is appealing for ATI applications.\n\n2.3.1.4 Helix\n\nThe last formation considered here is the Helix formation used in the TanDEM-X\n\nmission [1, 71, 72]. In this particular case, the formation consists of two spacecraft with\n\ndei \u00bc de 6\u00bc 0\ndii \u00bc di 6\u00bc 0\nai \u00bc bi \u00bc ai?1 \u00fe Da\n\n: (2.29)\n\nIn the particular case of TanDEM-X we have a1 \u00bc 90? , and Da \u00bc 180? . The\nappeal of this solution is that it is passively safe: there is always a cross-track\n\nseparation between the spacecraft, so that along-track drifts can be tolerated\n\nwithout increasing the collision risk.\n\nFigure 2.12 shows the relative orbits and the resulting effective cross- and along-\n\ntrack baselines. The cross-track projections of the relative orbits describe an ellipse\n\nand never cross. Obviously, with only two spacecraft, the effective baseline\n\nbecomes the absolute value of a harmonic function, which implies that it vanishes\n\nat two points along each orbit, once during the ascending part and once during the\n\ndescending one. The latitudes corresponding to these two points are different,\n\nwhich implies that all locations can be observed with a sufficiently large baseline\n\nat least for one semi-orbit. Furthermore, for a systematic mapping mission, the\n\n88 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nformation parameters can be changed during different mission phases in order to\n\noptimize the baseline obtained at each latitude.\n\nIn principle, considering the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, the Helix concept\n\ncould be scaled to Ns spacecraft by taking Da \u00bc Db \u00bc 360?=Ns . However, this\nwould imply a small change in the orbit inclination, which would result in an\n\nundesired relative drift of the ascending nodes. An interesting alternative could be a\n\nmulti-satellite Helix with an even number of spacecraft with\n\nFig. 2.11 (a) Relative cross-track deviations with respect to mean (nominal) orbit for a\n\n3-spacecraft CarPe as a function of the mean argument of latitude (u).

Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Operational Modes\n\nThis section discusses the principal operation and acquisition modes in which a\n\nmultistatic system can be operated.\n\n2.3.2.1 Multistatic Modes\n\nWith multistatic modes we refer to how a multistatic system is operated in terms of\n\nwhich satellite is receiving and which one is transmitting. This is closely linked to the\n\ntype ofmultistatic configuration (see Sect. 2.1.2.2).We consider the followingmodes:\n\n\u2022 Bistatic mode. We follow the convention set for the TanDEM-X mission and\nloosely denominate as bistatic mode an operating way in which all enabled\n\nreceive satellites acquire the radar echoes of a common transmitter. Logically,\n\nthis is the only way in which a semi-active system would be operated. For fully-\n\nactive systems such as TanDEM-X or Tandem-L, this definition of the bistatic\n\nmode implies that the transmitting satellite is actually acquiring monostatic SAR\n\ndata. Note for these and similar mission concepts the single transmitter bistatic\n\nmode is also the default operating mode.\n\n\u2022 Alternate bistatic mode. In this mode, pulses will be transmitted sequentially by\nat least two (enabled) transmitting spacecraft, while all enabled receivers collect\n\nthe corresponding radar echoes. For two-spacecraft systems it is also referred to\n\nas Ping-Pong mode. Alternate bistatic operations have the advantage of increas-\n\ning the number of phase centers (and baselines), and may also be used for phase\n\nsynchronization (see Sect. 2.3.3.5).\n\nThe drawback of alternate bistatic operations is that, in order to adequately\n\nsample the radar echoes in azimuth (for a given desired azimuth ambiguity\n\nlevel), the PRF associated to each transmitter is constant. This implies that the\n\ntotal PRF is multiplied by the number of enabled transmitters with respect to the\n\nsingle transmitter bistatic mode. Generally speaking, this leads to higher range\n\nambiguities and/or a reduced swath width.\n\n\u2022 Multi-monostatic mode. This is a non-bistatic operation mode in which each\nspacecraft in a fully-active system acquires an independent monostatic image.\n\nMutual interference between the satellites can be suppressed by introducing a\n\nsufficient along-track separation, in which case we can refer to this mode as\n\npursuit-monostatic mode. Multi-monostatic acquisitions can also be useful for\nnon interferometric applications for which the different spacecraft acquire\n\ncompletely different information content. For example, several spacecraft may\n\nacquire different portions of the Doppler spectrum, in which case mutual\n\ninterference is suppressed by the different azimuth pointing of the radar\n\nbeams. Likewise, by using different elevation beams, a distributed system\n\noperating in this mode may simultaneously acquire two independent swathes.\n\n\u2022 MIMO modes. The idea in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output SAR modes [74, 75]\nis that it is possible to transmit simultaneously with multiple transmitters using\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 91\n\n\n\northogonal waveforms. An often overlooked limitation is that one-dimensional\n\northogonal waveforms are only possible if they have non overlapping spectral\n\ncontent, which makes them useless for most multistatic applications (in particu-\n\nlar for interferometric applications). However, MIMO concepts are possible\n\nusing digital beamforming systems and using multi-dimensional waveform\n\nencoding [62]. The drawback of possible MIMO modes is, therefore, the\n\nincreased complexity of the receivers. Despite these limitations, MIMO modes\n\nare probably the correct approach for multistatic concepts requiring a large\n\nnumber of phase centers.\n\n2.3.2.2 SAR Acquisitions Modes\n\nSAR images can be acquired in different modes. The standard operating mode is\n\nstrip-map, which uses a fixed beam and for which the azimuth resolution may be\n\napproximated as half the effective two-way antenna length, Leff, defined by (2.11).\nDue to the different along-track positions of the effective mono- or bistatic phase\n\ncenters, the instantaneous Doppler frequency with which they see a given target has\n\nan offset given by\n\nDf D \u00bc Ka ?\nDrt\nvsat\n\n; (2.31)\n\nwhere Drt is the along-track separation of the phase centers (which, for example, in\nthe case of a semi-active system would be half the physical along-track separation\n\nbetween the receivers), and Ka is the Doppler rate. In the case of a strip-map\nacquisition, this instantaneous offset does not necessarily imply an offset in the\n\nacquired Doppler bandwidth, it just means that a given Doppler spectral component\n\nis acquired at a different time. As discussed in Sect. 2.2.1 the different antenna\n\npatterns can be optimized in several ways, causing loss of common Doppler\n\nbandwidth when the SNRs are maximized, or a loss of sensitivity if the common\n\nDoppler bandwidth is maximized. The consequence, from a mission designer point\n\nof view, is an upper limit to the along-track spread of the multiple mono- and/or\n\nbistatic phase centers.\n\nIt is also possible to operate a multistatic system in spotlight [76, 77] or sliding\n\nspotlight modes. In those modes, the beam is rotated in azimuth so that the targets\n\nremain for a longer time within the main-lobe of the two-way antenna beam pattern.\n\nThis increases the available Doppler bandwidth and, therefore, the azimuth resolu-\n\ntion of the system. In the multistatic case this makes it easier to obtain the required\n\ncommon Doppler bandwidth, thus allowing larger spreads between the phase\n\ncenters. The drawback is that it adds the complexity of synchronizing the steering\n\nof the multiple transmit and receive patterns.\n\nFinally, it is common to trade-off resolution for swath width by operating the\n\nSAR system in burst modes such as ScanSAR [78, 79] or TOPS [60]. In these\n\n92 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nmodes the radar interleaves bursts of pulses with antenna patterns pointed at\n\ndifferent elevation angles in order to acquire a number of sub-swathes. This time-\n\nmultiplexing of the elevation beams implies that the length of the synthetic aper-\n\nture, and thus the available Doppler bandwidth, is reduced by a factor at least as\n\nlarge as the number of sub-swathes.\n\nFigure 2.13 shows the time-Doppler diagram for a two-phase center multistatic\n\nScanSAR acquisition. The black lines correspond to the Doppler frequency history\n\nof targets located at different azimuth positions as seen by the leading bistatic phase\n\ncenter, while the blue lines correspond to the same targets, but seen by the trailing\n\nphase center. The vertical separation between each pair of lines is given by (2.30),\n\nfor a semi-active X-band system with a 550 km orbit height and 1 km along-track\n\nseparation. The slope of the lines is the Doppler rate, Ka . The rectangular shaded\nareas represent the time-Doppler frequency window of the ScanSAR bursts. This\n\nclearly illustrates how the range of acquired Doppler frequencies depends on the\n\ntarget position and on the bistatic phase center. To generate sets of multistatic\n\nimages with compatible Doppler frequency components Df Dmust be small com-\npared to the burst bandwidth\n\nBburst \u00bc jKaj ? Tburst: (2.32)\n\nUnlike for strip-map mode, the loss of common Doppler bandwidth in multistatic\n\nScanSAR cannot be avoided by an optimized steering. Therefore, it needs to be kept\n\nsmall, in relative terms, by constraining the separation between the phase centers. A\n\nsimilar analysis, with similar conclusions, is applicable to multistatic TOPS\n\nacquisitions. Multistatic wide-swath burst-modes are fundamentally inefficient\n\nand, therefore, unappealing.\n\nFig. 2.13 Time-Doppler diagram for a bistatic ScanSAR acquisition. Each same-color line\nrepresents a target at a different azimuth position, while the blue and black color coding corre-\nspond to two different bistatic phase centers. The shaded areas represent the time-frequency\n\nacquisition window of a ScanSAR burst\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 93\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Radar Synchronization\n\n2.3.3.1 Oscillator Noise and Relative Phase Errors\n\nOne of the characteristic challenges of a multistatic system is the need to syn-\n\nchronize the distributed sub-systems [80\u201383]. This includes a temporal synchro-\n\nnization in order to align, for example, the sampling windows, and the much more\n\ndemanding phase synchronization required to have a truly coherent system.\n\nPrecise phase synchronization is required for any application that aims at coher-\n\nently combining the information acquired by different receives. This includes all\n\ninterferometric and tomographic applications, but also distributed imaging\n\napproaches.\n\nFor distributed systems using a single dedicated and common transmitter with a\n\nnumber of passive receive systems, it may be sufficient, for some applications, to\n\nlimit the precise phase synchronization to the receivers.\n\nThe instantaneous phase of an oscillator can be written as\n\nyosc\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 2p ? f 0 ? t\u00fe f\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe f0; (2.33)\n\nwhere f 0 is the center frequency,f\u00f0t\u00de a time-varying phase error, andf0 a constant,\narbitrary phase. It is worth mentioning explicitly that f\u00f0t\u00de is a non-stationary\nrandom process, which may be modeled as the sum of a zero-mean stationary\n\nterm and a random walk term\n\nf\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc fst\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe frw\u00f0t\u00de: (2.34)\n\nThe random walk term is essential to understand the long-term evolution of the\n\ntotal phase error [84\u201386]. For any transmitter-receiver or receiver-receiver pair, the\n\nrelative phase difference will be the difference of two independent random pro-\n\ncesses, and can be expressed as\n\nDf\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 2p ? Df 0 ? t\u00fe fst\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe frw\u00f0t\u00de; (2.35)\n\na relative frequency term resulting in a linear phase component, and, again, the sum\n\nof a stationary process and a random walk component. Let us consider these three\n\nterms and their impact on the multistatic SAR products.\n\n\u2022 An uncompensated (residual) linear phase error between a transmitter and the\n\nreceivers will introduce an apparent Doppler for all targets, with the\n\ncorresponding azimuth displacement in the processed image. After SAR\n\nprocessing each image would have a relative phase error proportional to the\n\nrelative along-track position of the spacecraft. For ATI or GMTI applications,\n\nthe error would introduce a bias in the target velocity estimation. For XTI\n\napplications, due to the inevitable along-track separation between the spacecraft,\n\n94 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nthis phase error would be interpreted as a height offset. In theory, applications\n\nrequiring the combination of the signal of more than two receivers (e.g. single-\n\npass tomography) could be totally impaired by these errors. Nevertheless, this\n\ncould be casted as the typical phase calibration problem present in repeat-pass\n\ntomography, which can be solved using data-based calibration approaches.\n\n\u2022 A residual linear term between different receivers would introduce relative\n\nphase ramps in azimuth between the SAR images. In many cases this error can\n\nbe calibrated out using a priori information. For example, in most cases there\n\nwould be enough a priori topographic knowledge to eliminate an erroneous\n\nazimuth ramp from a generated Digital Elevation Model.\n\n\u2022 The stationary term is a colored random process whose single sideband (SSB)\n\npower spectrum is usually described by the superposition of (up to) five fre-\n\nquency components [87],\n\nSSSBf \u00f0f \u00de \u00bc\nX4\ni\u00bc0\n\nbi f\n?i for f > f c; (2.36)\n\nwhere f c is a lower cut-off frequency that is required to keep the total power\nfinite, so that (2.35) describes a proper stationary process. High-frequency\n\ncomponents will have an effect similar to that of thermal noise, and will result\n\nin an increase of spurious side-lobe levels. Lower frequency terms, with time\n\nscales in the order of the aperture length, modify the apparent phase history of\n\nthe received signal. This results in a defocusing of the SAR image, with a\n\nwidening of the azimuth point-target response, and random azimuth and range\n\ndisplacements of the focused targets. Frequency components greater or equal to\n\nthe inverse of the aperture length, f > 1=Ta , will result in an azimuth phase\nmodulation in the focused image and, consequently, in the resulting\n\ninterferograms.\n\n\u2022 The random walk component will result in a phase error whose variance\n\nincreases linearly with time [84]\n\ns2f;rw\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u00f02pf 0\u00de2c2rwjtj; (2.37)\n\nwhere crw is a constant that characterizes this process. This describes the\nexpected unbounded drift of the relative phase of two oscillators. For most\n\npractical purposes, for acquisitions of a limited duration, the short-term drift\n\ncan be described by the low frequency spectral components of a stationary phase\n\nerror. Long-term drifts can be characterized as phase offsets that change ran-\n\ndomly from acquisition to acquisition.\n\nIn radar systems, like in many telecommunication systems, all frequency\n\nreferences are always derived from a common master oscillator. Radars use\n\nUltra Stable Oscillators (USO) as this reference. Usually these USOs operate at\n\nrelatively low frequencies (values in the 5\u201310 MHz range are typical). The higher\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 95\n\n\n\nfrequencies required through-out the systems are derived from these master\n\nfrequency source using combinations of phase-locked synthesizers, Direct Digital\n\nSynthesizers (DDSs) and/or frequency multipliers. For low frequency phase noise\n\ncomponents all these alternatives end-up multiplying the phase noise by the ratio\n\nbetween the synthesized frequency and that of the USO. The consequence is that\n\nwith the same USO technology, the severity of oscillator induced phase errors is\n\ndirectly proportional to the operating frequency of the radar. For a mission\n\ndesign, this may lead to different synchronization approaches depending on the\n\noperating band.\n\nFigure 2.14 shows and example of the single sideband phase noise spectrum of a\n\ntypical space qualified USO and the difference between two random realizations of\n\nthe corresponding random processes. A 10 MHz reference oscillator is assumed\n\nwith the phase noise levels versus frequency given in the first row of Table 2.1 [82]\n\nwith a multiplication factor of 530 to reach a typical C-band operating frequency of\n\n5.3 GHz. To get a sense of what is possible in terms of space qualified USOs, the\n\nsecond row in the table shows the phase noise requirements for the 5 MHz reference\n\nUSO for the PHARAO system [88, 89].\n\nFig. 2.14 Top: example of the single sideband phase-noise spectrum of a typical spaceborne\n10 MHz USO.

Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\n2.3.3.2 Synchronization by Means of Dedicated Synchronization Links\n\nFrom the previous analysis, it is clear that some strategy is required to synchronize\n\nin slow time and in phase the different subsystems in a distributed multistatic radar\n\nmission. The most direct approach is to use dedicated synchronization links in order\n\nto exchange synchronization information. The simplest conceivable scheme would\n\nbe to designate one spacecraft as the master reference and let it distribute a\n\nreference synchronization signal to all other spacecraft by means of radio frequency\n\nlinks and use it to correct the phase of frequency references of the slave satellites.\n\nCalling the phase of the master frequency referencef1 , and fi the phase of the\noscillator at a sub-system i, the phase difference measured at i would be\n\nD~fi1\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc fi\u00f0t\u00de ? f1\u00f0t\u00de ?\n2pf ref\nc0\n\n? Bi1\u00f0t\u00de; (2.38)\n\nwhere f ref is the reference frequency, and Bi1\u00f0t\u00de is the time varying physical\nseparation, or baseline, between the two spacecraft. Due to the phase offset\n\nresulting from the spacecraft separation, no absolute phase synchronization can\n\nbe achieved with a one-way link unless this baseline is known within a small\n\nenough fraction of a wavelength. The solution to this problem is to use a two-\n\nway link, as done in the TanDEM-X mission. The addition of the return link results\n\nin an additional phase difference equation\n\nD~f1i\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc f1\u00f0t\u00de ? fi\u00f0t\u00de ?\n2pf ref\nc0\n\n? Bi1\u00f0t\u00de: (2.39)\n\nNow from the addition of (2.38) and (2.39) it is possible to estimate the physical\n\nseparation between the satellites, while the baseline term vanishes when both\n\nequations are subtracted. The actual phase difference between the oscillators can\n\nthen be estimated from\n\nDfi1 \u00bc\nD~fi1 ? D~f1i\n\n2\n: (2.40)\n\nThis expression hides a subtlety: because phase differences are measured mod-\n\nulo2p, this by 2 division results in an undesiredpambiguity in the resulting phase. If\nthe signals exchanged are not pure sinusoidal but, for example, pulsed signals (as in\n\nTanDEM-X [82]), the p ambiguity may be resolved from the estimated pulse\ndelays.2 Since this ambiguities matter only at the operating frequency of the\n\nradar, an alternative approach to solving them is to operate the sync-link at a\n\n2Note that the synchronization equations can be written in terms of time delays instead of phases,\n\nin which case there are no ambiguities. Nevertheless, the resolution provided by phase\n\nmeasurements is generally speaking orders of magnitude better than the estimated delays.\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 97\n\n\n\nreference frequency that is an even fraction of the radar frequency. In this case, the\n\nfrequency multiplication operation required to generate the desired radar reference\n\nfrequency will eliminate any pdifference. This approach, however, requires the\nintroduction of sub-systems at new frequency which complicates the overall design.\n\nA two-way synchronization link assumes reciprocity, so that hardware induced\n\ndelays or phase shifts are identical in both directions. This assumption has to be\n\nconsidered in the implementation of the link and, in practice, it can become a\n\nlimiting factor, since hardware components are never perfectly identical.\n\nIt is also desirable to have a near ideal radio channel, i.e. a multi-path free line-\n\nof-sight path between the spacecraft. In most formation flying concepts the relative\n\npositions of the spacecraft change along the orbit. Therefore, it is necessary to have\n\na number of sync-antennas placed strategically around the satellites in order to\n\ncover all directions. For example, in the case of TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, each\n\nspacecraft has 6 synchronization horns.3\n\nFor a pulse-based sync-link another important consideration is the required pulse\n\nrepetition frequency. In the case of TanDEM-X the synchronization pulses are\n\ninterleaved with the regular radar pulses, which results in azimuth gaps in the\n\nresulting SAR raw data. In order to avoid the appearance of artifacts in the focused\n\nSAR image, the number of gaps needs to be as small as possible, which implies a\n\nlow sync-pulse frequency. From a sampling theory point of view this is possible\n\nbecause oscillator phase noise is a low-pass random process. However, it is also\n\nnecessary to estimate the difference between the reference frequencies, which can\n\nbe in the order of tens or hundreds of Hertz. This can be done by including a\n\nfrequency offset estimation step using a high sync-pulse frequency before the start\n\nof an acquisition.\n\nA practical implementation of the sync-link processing is quite more complex\n\nthan a direct application of (2.40) For example, it needs to take into account that the\n\nphase measurements may not be performed simultaneously, requiring the interpo-\n\nlation of them to an appropriate common time base. It also needs to account for\n\nDoppler effects (time varying inter-spacecraft separation) or with relativistic\n\neffects: sync-pulse measurements and calculations done in a moving reference\n\nframe tied to the spacecraft formation result in small errors if the SAR processing\n\nis done in a reference frame tied to the Earth.\n\n2.3.3.3 GNSS Based Synchronization\n\nA widespread approach to synchronize distributed systems is the use of the Global\n\nNavigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) [90, 91] such as the GPS system or the\n\nupcoming Galileo constellation. GPS disciplined oscillators are also a common\n\nsolution for systems requiring very good long-term frequency stability. Generally\n\n3 In this particular case, the number 6 is also related to the overall RF design of the radar\n\nsynchronization system in order to achieve an omnidirectional field of view.\n\n98 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nspeaking, GNSS frequency references have very good long-term stability. For the\n\nshort term, however, the quality of the phase is limited by the low SNR of the GNSS\n\nsignal, which requires long integration times in order to reduce the phase noise.\n\nThus, a GNSS disciplined oscillator will use a high performance crystal oscillator to\n\nprovide the best possible short-time stability and low phase noise, while relying on\n\nthe GNSS reference for longer-term frequency and phase stability.\n\nIt is clear that, where feasible, GNSS based synchronization would be the first\n\nchoice for a multistatic system. Most SAR spacecraft incorporate high performance\n\nGNSS units, which are used for positioning. For formation flying systems, GNSS\n\nwill also typically be used for relative position estimation. As it is generally known,\n\nGNSS receivers need to solve the 3-D position vector and the time offset (phase) of\n\ntheir internal time reference w.r.t. the time reference of the GNSS system. Like-\n\nwise, Differential GNSS solutions need to resolve the 3-D differential position\n\nvector and also the relative time offsets. This implies that a formation flying\n\nmultistatic system using Differential GNSS processing for relative position deter-\n\nmination is automatically also providing a common time reference. Using Carrier\n\nDifferential GPS signals (CDGPS), the relative position can be estimated with a 3D\n\nRMS error in the order of 1.5 mm [92, 93], with the individual components in the\n\n1 mm error range. This implies a long-term relative timing error in the order of\n\n10?3=3 ? 108 ? 3 ? 10?12 s, which represents about 12? of RMS error at X-band and\nonly about 1.5? at L-band. From this brief analysis it may be concluded that\nGNSS-based synchronization may be good enough for low frequency (P-, L- and\n\nmaybe S-band) multistatic radar missions. For higher frequencies GNSS synchro-\n\nnization by itself seems insufficient.\n\n2.3.3.4 Multisquint Processing\n\nThe last phase-synchronization approach considered is to, somehow, try to estimate\n\nthe phase error from the acquired radar data. There are actually several methods to\n\ncalibrate (or partially calibrate) phase errors using the radar echoes.\n\nThe first such method is the Multisquint processing approach [94, 95], developed\n\nas a Motion Compensation (MoCo) technique in repeat-pass airborne SAR inter-\n\nferometry. In that case, baseline errors are the result of errors in the position\n\nestimation by the Inertial Navigation System (INS) of the aircraft. These errors\n\nare due to high frequency components of the flight track due to turbulence or pilot\n\nmanoeuvres. At the temporal scales of the integration time corresponding to the\n\nsynthetic aperture length, these errors are typically much more severe than relative\n\nphase differences of two oscillators.\n\nBefore explaining the Multisquint processing approach, it is important to remark\n\nthat a time varying phase error implies a relative Doppler shift, which in turn will\n\nresult in a relative azimuth shift in the focused image. This azimuth shift will\n\nintroduce decorrelation due to co-registration errors in the uncompensated\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 99\n\n\n\ninterferogram. In fact, Multisquint processing was originally developed as an\n\nazimuth coregistration error estimation technique.\n\nMultisquint processing of an interferometric pair follows the following steps:\n\n1. A number (Nsub) of sub-look master and slave images is generated\n\ncorresponding to different narrowband Doppler spectra. These images will\n\nhave a reduced azimuth resolution. Therefore, the coherence loss due to the\n\nazimuth coregistration errors will have a smaller impact.\n\n2. For each pair of sub-look SLC images, a corresponding interferogram is\n\ngenerated. This stack of sub-look interferograms contain the same topographic\n\nphase information, but the systematic error is the one corresponding to the beam\n\ncenter position of each look, and thus to different azimuth positions.\n\n3. The phase difference between consecutive sub-looks is calculated, generating\n\nNsub-1 double interferograms. Here, the topographic phase contribution cancels\n\nout. The resulting phase is the difference of the phase errors at the two beam\n\ncenter positions, and can be scaled to a derivative of the relative phase error\n\nversus azimuth position.\n\n4. The double difference interferograms now need to be aligned such that each\n\nazimuth position corresponds to a beam center position (or to the raw data\n\nposition) instead of corresponding to the same ground-azimuth (zero-Doppler)\n\nposition. Once they are properly aligned, the Nsub-1 double interferograms can\n\nbe averaged.\n\n5. Now the double interferogram phases can be averaged in range (in the original\n\nMoCo application there is a range dependence that can be exploited to separate\n\ndifferent relative motion components).\n\n6. The last step is to integrate in azimuth the resulting estimated double differences,\n\nobtaining an estimate of the phase error versus azimuth. This integration step is a\n\nsource of numerical errors, since zero mean random errors will result in a\n\nrandom walk error component in the solution. Nevertheless, since a lot of\n\naveraging is done prior to the integration, this resulting random walk component\n\nresults in a very low frequency error. It should also be clear that a constant error\n\nterm cannot be recovered through this process.\n\nMultisquint processing has been proposed and successfully tested as a possible\n\nback-up solution for the TanDEM-X mission, to cover the unlikely event that the\n\nsynchronization link would fail [96]. Figure 2.15 shows an example of an overlay of\n\nthe interferometric phase on the intensity before (top) and after (bottom)\n\nMultisquint phase synchronization. The nominal flat Earth phase has been\n\nsubtracted, so that the remaining fringes are, in theory, due to the topography.\n\nThe low frequency range fringes are a residual flat earth component due to the\n\ndifference of the mean height of the scene and the reference height used to flatten\n\nthe interferogram. Comparing the two phase images it can be appreciated how after\n\nMultisquint processing an azimuth modulation has been removed. The estimated\n\nphase error, after removal of the linear component, is shown in Fig. 2.16.\n\n100 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\n2.3.3.5 Alternate Bistatic Redundant Imaging\n\nThe second and last data driven calibration approach considered is applicable to\n\ndistributed systems where all satellites transmit. An example would be the\n\nalternate bistatic mode of TanDEM-X, which is equivalent to the so-called\n\nFig. 2.16 ExampleofMultisquint estimatedphase error corresponding to the example shown inFig. 2.15\n\nFig. 2.15 Overlay of interferometric phase of a TanDEM-X acquisition on the corresponding\n\nintensity image. Top: before phase synchronization (the linear phase term due to the small\nfrequency offset has been removed). Bottom: after phase correction using Multisquint processing.\nIn both cases a nominal flat Earth term has been removed (Courtesy of Marc Rodriguez-Cassola,\n\nDLR, Microwaves and Radar Institute)\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 101\n\n\n\nsimultaneous monostatic and bistatic mode (SiMB-static) discussed for the\n\nRADARSAT-2/3 topographic mission concept [3, 4]. The concept is quite simple:\n\ndue to reciprocity, the two (or more) bistatic images acquired in an alternate\n\nbistatic operation mode are, in theory, identical and, therefore, redundant. How-\n\never, the bistatic images will be corrupted by the relative oscillator phase error,\n\nwhich will be of the same magnitude but opposite sign for the two images in a\n\nredundant pair. Thus, the phase error can be estimated directly from the phase\n\ndifferences between the redundant raw bistatic images. It is interesting to note that\n\nthis is conceptually equivalent to a dedicated sync-link, replacing the nearly ideal\n\nLOS channel by a random time-varying channel. While it seems appealing to use\n\nthis approach instead of a dedicated sync-link, it has two clear disadvantages:\n\n\u2022 In order to obtain really redundant bistatic pairs, each of them needs to ade-\n\nquately sample the Doppler spectrum. This means that the total PRF of the\n\nsystem needs to be roughly a factor of two higher than that of a regular\n\nacquisition, which will, in general, tend to reduce the achievable swath width\n\nand reduce the achievable sensitivity.\n\n\u2022 The data rate is also duplicated.\n\nA possible way to relax these problems could be to not to transmit the full pulse\n\nbandwidth with both systems. Instead, each system could transmit a bit more than\n\nhalf the total bandwidth, with an overlapping fraction that would be used for\n\ncalibration. This solves the data rate and sensitivity (radar duty cycle) problems,\n\nbut, generally speaking, it does not solve the high PRF problem.\n\nDespite the aforementioned issues, this calibration approach may be of high\n\ninterest for missions considering alternate bistatic as the default mode in order to\n\nexploit the resulting multi-baseline data set.\n\n2.3.4 Baseline Determination and Calibration\n\nAll multistatic mission concepts in which the data acquired by the different sub-\n\nsystems is combined coherently require very good knowledge of the relative\n\nposition of the spacecraft, and, in particular, of their relative cross-track position.\n\nAlthough relative navigation is discussed in detail in Part 2 of this book, in this\n\nsection we want to briefly discuss the general requirements and the impact of\n\nrelative position knowledge errors. Here, we can distinguish between perpendicular\n\nbaseline knowledge-error, i.e. the error in the relative position component perpen-\n\ndicular to the line-of-sight (LOS) to the target, and LOS error. As discussed in detail\n\nin Chap. 5, with the use of differential GNSS techniques, the relative position can\n\nbe determined with a 3-D uncertainty in the order of a millimeter, so a main\n\nquestion is if this baseline knowledge is sufficient.\n\nAlthough the perpendicular baseline is what determines the interferometric or\n\ntomographic sensitivity of a given configuration, small errors have a mild effect.\n\nGenerally speaking, the perpendicular baseline knowledge error should be a small\n\n102 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_5\n\n\nfraction of the actual perpendicular baseline. This is in most cases fulfilled using the\n\naforementioned GNSS based relative position estimates.\n\nIn contrast, while the LOS baseline is irrelevant from a sensitivity point of view,\n\nLOS baseline errors have a large impact: a LOS baseline uncertainty DBLOSwill\nresult in a phase error\n\nDf \u00bc nw ? k0 ? DBLOS \u00bc 2p ? nw DBLOSl0 ; (2.41)\n\nwhere, as before, nw is 1 if a single transmitter is used, and 2 for multi-monostatic\ndata sets. From (2.41) it is clear that the LOS relative position must be known with a\n\nsmall fraction of the wavelength.\n\nFor single baseline cross-track interferometric applications, a LOS baseline error\n\nwill introduce a height offset and a (usually small) slope in ground range in the\n\nresulting DEM. For multi-baseline applications the resulting phase errors make the\n\narray processing more difficult.\n\n2.4 Study Examples\n\nIn this section we discuss three current multistatic mission concepts: Tandem-L,\n\nSIGNAL, and PICOSAR. The reader is referred to Part 4 of this book for much\n\nmore detailed discussions of several other mission concepts.\n\n2.4.1 Tandem-L\n\nTandem-L [97\u201399] is a German proposal for a two-spacecraft formation-flying\n\nL-band SAR system conceived to monitor the Earth, with an emphasis on dynamic\n\nprocesses (Fig. 2.17). The most relevant mission objectives are global inventories\n\nof forest height and above-ground biomass, large-scale measurements of Earth\n\nsurface deformations due to plate tectonics, erosion and anthropogenic activities,\n\nobservations of glacier movements and 3-D structure changes in land and sea ice,\n\nand the monitoring of ocean surface currents.\n\nIn order to monitor dynamic processes at continental scales implies unprecedent-\n\nedly high system requirements in terms of swath width, duty cycle, and data rate. A\n\nkey to satisfy these requirements is the use of advanced Digital Beamforming (DBF)\n\ntechniques to achieve a very wide swath combined with a fine spatial resolution.\n\nIn order to acquire the forest height and biomass inventories, Tandem-L relies on\n\nthe ability of performing single-pass fully polarimetric and interferometric (Pol-\n\nInSAR) measurements.\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 103\n\n\n\n2.4.1.1 Science Requirements\n\nThe primary mission goals of Tandem-L can be grouped in three categories:\n\n\u2022 Biosphere (3-D vegetation monitoring):\n\n\u2013 Measurement of forest height and structure\n\n\u2013 Global inventory of above ground forest biomass\n\n\u2013 Detecting vegetation disturbances and biomass changes\n\n\u2022 Geo-/lithosphere (deformation measurements):\n\n\u2013 Understanding earthquake and volcano eruption cycles\n\n\u2013 Quantifying the magnitude of events\n\n\u2013 Determination and forecasting the probability of events\n\n\u2022 Hydro- and cryosphere (structure and deformation):\n\n\u2013 Measurements of ice structure and its changes\n\n\u2013 Monitoring soil moisture and surface water changes\n\n\u2013 Observation of ocean currents and wave field dynamics\n\nTable 2.2 provides a summary of some basic user requirements for the most\n\nimportant applications.\n\nFig. 2.17 The Tandem-L mission concept relies on a systematic data acquisition strategy using a\n\npair of L-band SAR satellites flying in close formation. The satellite system is operated in two\n\nbasic data acquisition modes: 3-D structure mode and deformation mode. New SAR imaging\n\ntechniques enable frequent coverage with high geometric resolution\n\n104 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\n2.4.1.2 Mission Concept\n\nA salient aspect of the Tandem-L mission is a systematic data acquisition plan using\n\na two-spacecraft multistatic (fully-active) configuration. The two-satellites will be\n\noperated in two alternating modes:\n\n\u2022 The 3-D structure mode, during which the two spacecraft will be used only to\n\nacquire Pol-InSAR measurements of forests and other semi-transparent volume\n\nscatterers (ice, sand, etc.).\n\n\u2022 The deformation mode, which relies on repeat-pass DInSAR measurements.\n\nIn this mode, the two spacecraft will be used to double the acquired swath,\n\noperating in a multi-monostatic way.\n\nFor the deformation mode, the two main performance limiting factors are\n\ntemporal decorrelation and atmospheric effects (the atmospheric phase screen).\n\nWhile temporal decorrelation can be addressed by increasing the resolution in order\n\nto be able to average more independent looks, the spatially smooth atmospheric\n\nphase errors can only be mitigated by maximizing the number of acquisitions. For\n\nthat purpose, a 8-day repeat-cycle is proposed.\n\nTable 2.2 Tandem-L requirements summary\n\nScience product Coverage\n\nProduct\n\nresolution\n\nProduct\n\naccuracy\n\nBiosphere Forest height\n\nAbove ground\n\nbiomass\n\nAll forest areas 50 m (global) ~10%\n\n20 m (local)\n\nVertical forest\n\nstructure\n\n100 m\n\n(global)\n\n~20% (or\n\n20 t/ha)\n\nUnderlying topography 50 m (regional)\n\n50 m (global) 3 layers\n\n20 m (local)\n\n50 m <4 m\n\nGeo-/lithosphere Plate tectonics All risk areas 100 m (global) 1 mm/year\n\n(after\n\n5 years)\n<20 m (fault)\n\nVolcanoes All land volcanoes 20\u201350 m 5 mm/week\n\nLandslides Risk areas 5\u201320 m 5 mm/week\n\nSubsidence Urban areas 5\u201320 m 1 mm/year\n\nCryo- and\n\nhydrosphere\n\nGlacier flow Main glaciers 100\u2013500 m 5\u201350 m/year\n\nSoil moisture Selected areas 50 m 5\u201310%\n\nWater level change Regional 50 m 10 cm\n\nSnow water\n\nequivalent\n\nLocal (exp.) 100\u2013500 m 10\u201320%\n\nIce structure changes Local (exp.) 100 m >1 layer\n\nOcean currents Prio. areas ~100 m <1 m/s\n\nAll Digital terrain\n\nand surface model\n\nGlobal ~20 m (bare) 2 m (bare)\n\n~50 m (forest) 4 m (veg.)\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 105\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 2.2, the optimal baseline for the structure mode is\n\ndependent on the structure height to be observed (see Fig. 2.18). Moreover,\n\nbiomass estimation accuracies below 10% can be achieved by combining\n\nacquisitions with different baselines. To address this, the mission plan includes\n\nsystematic variations of the interferometric baseline. An elegant technique to\n\nprovide this wide range of cross-track baselines exploits the naturally occurring\n\ndifferential secular variations of the right ascension of the ascending nodes in\n\nresponse to slightly different inclinations. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.19 which\n\nFig. 2.18 Correspondence between vertical wavenumbers and perpendicular baselines (B?) as a\nfunction of the incident angle and the orbital altitude\n\nFig. 2.19 A systematic variation of the equatorial cross-track baselines can be achieved by using\n\norbits with slightly different inclinations. The inclination offset causes a relative drift of the\n\nascending nodes\n\n106 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\nshows the evolution of the horizontal baselines at the equator for different\n\ninclination offsets (expressed as horizontal baselines at the northern and southern\n\norbit turns). The figure also indicates the Dv required to introduce the inclination\noffset. Recall that this Dvis a measure of the impulse (normalized to unit mass)\nrequired to achieve the modified orbit, and goes directly into the fuel budget, and\n\neventually the lifetime, of the mission. As also illustrated by this figure, Tandem-\n\nL relies mainly on the horizontal baseline, which yields smaller cross-track\n\nbaselines for higher latitudes. In order to obtain the desired range of baselines\n\nover tropical and boreal regions, the Tandem-L acquisition plan will combine the\n\nuse of mainly bistatic (with one of the two spacecraft acting as common illumi-\n\nnator for both) acquisitions in equatorial regions, and alternate bistatic or multi-\n\nmonostatic acquisitions at higher latitudes.\n\n2.4.1.3 System Concept\n\nThe Tandem-L system concept includes the use of a large reflector antenna\n\ncombined a digital feed array, using SCan-On-REceive (SCORE) [100\u2013102] in\n\norder to obtain a sufficiently wide swath despite the narrow, high-gain, receive\n\nbeam. SCORE exploits the one-to-one relation between range delay and direction\n\nof arrival present in side-looking radar systems. SCORE combines multiple sub-\n\naperture signals such that at each instant of time a narrow beam is steered towards\n\nthe echo\u2019s expected direction of arrival. This allows a high antenna gain (on\n\nreceive) without automatically coupling it to a narrow swath. A narrow receive\n\nbeam has the further advantage of attenuating range ambiguities. By combining\n\nthe SCORE technique with a broad transmit beam, a highly sensitive SAR system\n\nwith wide swath coverage can be built. While all feed elements are used during\n\ntransmission, allowing the illumination of a large image swath, a small number of\n\nfeed elements (2\u20135, depending on the implementation) are activated at one time\n\nduring the receive window. The active feed element positions are periodically\n\nshifted in synchrony with the systematic variation of the direction of arrival from\n\nthe swath echoes. The advantages of this concept are manifold. First, the use of a\n\nlarge reflector antenna in connection with digital beamforming allows the reduc-\n\ntion of the transmit power by a factor of 3\u20134 in comparison to the traditional SAR\n\nconcept for the same imaging parameters. Second, it allows the mapping of a\n\nmuch wider swath (ca. 350 km) in high resolution strip-map mode with low range\n\nambiguity levels [62, 98]. The fully polarimetric acquisition in strip-map mode\n\nwith a wide swath is possible without the constraints of conventional SAR\n\nsystems. This leads, however, to a large data rate and requires the implementation\n\nof advanced technologies for high data rate downlink. Table 2.3 provides a\n\nsummary of preliminary system parameters.\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 107\n\n\n\n2.4.2 SIGNAL\n\nSIGNAL (SAR for Ice, Glacier aNd globAL Dynamics) [103\u2013105] is a forma-\n\ntion flying Ka-band SAR mission concept that has as main objective to\n\nestimate accurately and repeatedly topography and topographic changes\n\nassociated with mass change or other dynamic effects on glaciers, ice caps\n\nand polar ice sheets.\n\n2.4.2.1 Science Requirements\n\nRecent observations indicate a dramatic increase of ice mass losses from glaciers,\n\nice caps, and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets [106]. If confirmed, these\n\nobservations could lead to a mean sea level rise more as twice as large as the\n\nprojections from the IPCC 2007 report. While current observations clearly show the\n\nsensitivity of the Cryosphere to climate change, the feedbacks to the global climate\n\nsystem are still not well understood. To advance this understanding it is necessary\n\nto extend and improve the available observational data. In particular, it is necessary\n\nto acquire more quantitative data regarding the global water mass balance. One key\n\nparameter that is missing to improve this understanding of the intricate dynamics of\n\nice mass balances is a detailed and accurate knowledge of the 3-D ice surface\n\ntopography and its changes at fine spatial and temporal resolutions.\n\nThe main objective of SIGNAL is to fill major observational gaps with regard to\n\nmass-balance and dynamics of global glacier ice. The mission addresses those\n\ncomponents of the ice budget that have been subject to accelerated downwasting\n\nduring the last decade and for which the knowledge of the present mass balance and\n\ntemporal trends exhibits large error bars: the mountain glaciers and ice caps, and the\n\noutlet glaciers of the boundary zones of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. This\n\nmass balance can currently be studied with data from gravity missions like GRACE\n\n[107] or GOCE [108], which provide data from which absolute mass changes of\n\nthese components of the Cryosphere can be observed with a low spatial resolution\n\nTable 2.3 Preliminary system requirements for Tandem-L\n\nParameter Value Parameter Value\n\nOrbit height 760 km Reflector size 15 m (diameter)\n\nRepeat cycle 8 days Focal length 10 m\n\nIncident angle 26.3?\u201346.6?

There is, however, no mission in space or in preparation that can provide the\n\nrequired observations of these changes with high spatial detail (50\u2013200 m) and\n\ncontinuous spatial coverage.\n\nThe primary mission objectives are thus defined as:\n\n\u2022 Reducing the uncertainty in the mass balance of glaciers and ice caps;\n\n\u2022 Improving the knowledge on mass depletion of outlet glaciers in Greenland and\n\nAntarctica.\n\nThe secondary mission objectives are:\n\n\u2022 Downscaling of altimetric elevation data over ice sheets;\n\n\u2022 Mapping the motion of calving glaciers and ice streams in support of mass\n\nbalance retrieval;\n\n\u2022 Supporting the protection from natural hazards related to major mass\n\nmovements;\n\n\u2022 Assessing the new opportunities of high-frequency, high resolution interfero-\n\nmetric SAR data for sea ice surface parameter retrieval.\n\n2.4.2.2 Mission Concept\n\nIn order to achieve these scientific goals, SIGNAL aims at generating time series of\n\ndigital elevation models with height accuracies in the order of a few decimeters.\n\nThis leads to two fundamental mission aspects:\n\n\u2022 The use of Ka-band (35 GHz) to minimize the penetration into the ice or snow\n\ncover, in order to obtain a DEM that is truly representative of the surface.\n\n\u2022 The use of a pair of formation flying satellites. This is the only way to obtain the\n\nlong baselines, roughly 100 m, required to achieve the desired height sensitivity\n\nand measurement stability, avoiding temporal decorrelation effects.\n\nSIGNAL is designed to obtain sub-meter height accuracies ranging from 10 cm\n\nto 1 m, depending on the application and the required product resolution. For most\n\napplications, the required spatial resolution of the final product (50\u2013200 m) is\n\ncoarse compared to that of a topographic mission like TanDEM-X. This opens\n\nthe opportunity of using a very large number of looks resulting from the combina-\n\ntion of these moderate product resolution requirements with a high resolution SAR\n\nsystem. Note that while high system resolution is not a strong requirement, this high\n\nresolution emerges naturally from the compact system design (Fig. 2.20).\n\nSIGNAL is a proposal for a systematic mapping mission with a lifetime of at\n\nleast 5 years that will generate seasonal DEMs of the areas of interest. In addition to\n\nits mission driving interferometric capabilities, SIGNAL will also be a very capable\n\nsystem to estimate glacier velocities using incoherent feature tracking techniques.\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 109\n\n\n\nThese techniques are of particular interest for fast-flowing glaciers, for which\n\ncoherent techniques fail due to temporal decorrelation.\n\nTo optimally address the main topographic mission requirements but also the\n\nsecondary glacier velocity measurements, the mission will be divided into three\n\nrecurring scientific phases:\n\n\u2022 A DEM acquisition phase aimed at obtaining an initial DEM. During this phase,\n\nthe cross-track baseline will be set to around 40 m.\n\n\u2022 A DEM tracking phase aimed at monitoring DEM variations with very high\n\naccuracy. During this phase the distance between the two spacecraft will be\n\nincreased in order to achieve height of ambiguities in the 10\u201320 m range.\n\n\u2022 A glacier velocity monitoring phase. During this, one of the two spacecraft will\n\nbe rotated with respect to the other, thereby doubling the spatial coverage.\n\n2.4.2.3 System Concept\n\nIn order to provide the required SAR performance in terms of data sensitivity,\n\nambiguity rejection, and coverage, SIGNAL would use a reflector-based design in\n\ncombination with digital beamforming techniques such as SCORE. The total\n\ncoverage is further increased by simultaneously acquiring two sub-swathes\n\nseparated by a gap approximately twice the width of a single sub-swath (~25 km)\n\nFig. 2.20 Artist impression of SIGNAL. The preliminary design of the spacecraft is the result of a\n\nstudy conducted jointly by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Astrium GmbH\n\n110 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\n[105], by operating the instrument in the so-called multi-diamond SCORE mode\n\n[62, 109], as illustrated in Fig. 2.21.\n\nOn transmit two different transmit feed configurations are possible:\n\n\u2022 Pursuit-monostatic (multi-monostatic) operation: in this case the single\n\nreflector is required to simultaneously illuminate both sub-swathes, without the\n\nin-between gap. The total transmit power is thus distributed on both swathes.\n\n\u2022 Bistatic operation: Here each satellite can illuminate one of the two sub-\n\nswathes with the complete available power. On receive each SAR receives\n\nboth sub-swathes. In this case, the transmit feed network is simplified. Compared\n\nto the monostatic operation the transmit power can be approximately halved for\n\nthe same NESZ.\n\n2.4.3 PICOSAR\n\nPICOSAR (Passive Interferometric ocean Currents Observation Synthetic Aperture\n\nRadar), is a multistatic mission concept consisting of two small, low-cost and low\n\npower spacecraft carrying a passive, receive-only SAR payload. These two space-\n\ncraft fly at a safe distance of a Sentinel-1 (S1) [110, 111] class satellite, using it as a\n\ntransmitter of opportunity and enhancing it by adding a unique along-track\n\nFig. 2.21 Dual-diamond operation of SIGNAL instrument where two swathes are imaged simul-\n\ntaneously in strip-map mode\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 111\n\n\n\ninterferometer dedicated to ocean surface current measurements. The passive nature\n\nof this system and the focus on a single application and single operation mode\n\nallows the implementation of PICOSAR using a very cost-effective payload design\n\nand the use of a compact and low-cost micro-satellite bus. While it has many\n\ncommonalities with similar mission concepts, such as the Interferometric Cartwheel\n\n[5, 9, 112] (see Chap. 14), it is unique because of its focus on ocean currents\n\nobservation using along-track interferometry, which conditions many aspects of\n\nthe concept.\n\n2.4.3.1 Science Requirements\n\nOcean surface currents are continuous streams of ocean water induced by global\n\nwind fields. Due to the Coriolis effect, open ocean surface currents tend to organize\n\nin large circular patterns called gyres, which rotate clockwise in the Northern\n\nHemisphere, and counter clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Surface currents\n\nhave a major impact on regional climates. For example, the North Atlantic gyre,\n\nwhich includes the Gulf Stream, carries warm water, and therefore vast amounts of\n\nheat, North along the East North-American coast and eventually, through the North\n\nAtlantic Drift, to Western Europe. Surface currents also have a significant direct\n\neconomic impact due to their effect on shipping costs. Measuring and monitoring\n\nchanges in surface current patterns is of high importance to the understanding of the\n\nglobal sea-atmosphere interaction and the global climate and climate change.\n\nFor coastal regions, the IGOS(IntegratedGlobalObservingStrategy) coastal theme\n\nreport sets a target resolution of 3\u201310 cm/s with horizontal resolutions under 300 m.\n\n2.4.3.2 Mission Concept\n\nOcean currents are traditionally measured using drifters and, in coastal regions,\n\nusing land based HF radars. Single-channel SAR systems have also been used for\n\nyears to retrieve surface current information from the estimation of the Doppler\n\nCentroid anomaly [113]. However, the addition of a second channel, in an along-\n\ntrack interferometric (ATI) configuration, is what can turn a SAR system into a\n\nhighly accurate, high-resolution surface current mapping system [15, 114\u2013116].\n\nATI-SAR has been demonstrated with a number of airborne systems [117] and,\n\nmore recently, from space, using TerraSAR-X. By using two phase centers with an\n\nalong-track separation, an ATI system obtains two observations of the scene with\n\nexactly the same geometry, but separated by a short temporal lag. This temporal lag\n\nis proportional to the physical separation and inversely proportional to the velocity\n\nof the platform. Increasing the temporal lag increases the ATI sensitivity to the\n\nsurface velocity. However, for too large ATI lags, temporal decorrelation of the sea\n\nsurface degrades the final performance.\n\nIn PICOSAR, two receive-only satellites are flown in close formation, with an\n\nalong-track separation in the order of 100 m. This close formation will require\n\n112 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_14\n\n\nautonomous formation control, although a small Helixmay be added to introduce some\n\nlevel of passive formation safety, at the cost of introducing also a cross-track baseline\n\ncomponent. As illustrated in Fig. 2.22, the two PICOSAR satellites would fly in a\n\nconstellation with S1 at a distance of 25\u2013100 km, determined by safety considerations.\n\nIn its default operation mode, PICOSAR will acquire data when S1 operates\n\nits Wave Mode [111]. In this mode, S1 acquires 20 ? 20 km2 vignettes every\n100 km, with an incidence angle toggling between 23? and 36?. In its simplest\nincarnation, PICOSAR would acquire only a single incidence angle, which allows a\n\nsingle-, fixed-beam system design. Note that since S1 illuminated a swath signifi-\n\ncantly wider than 20 km, PICOSAR\u2019s swath width could be extended to about\n\n100 km. Nevertheless, a 20 km swath width is well suited to a circular reflector\n\nantenna with a diameter in the order of 2 m. Sentinel-1 will operate in Wave Mode\n\nby default every time it flies over the oceans, thus roughly 70% of the time.\n\nFigure 2.23 shows the data volume per orbit acquired by each receive spacecraft as\n\na function of the acquired swath width, for both possible incidence angles. For the\n\nnear range beam, S1 uses a larger pulse bandwidth in order to keep the ground range\n\nresolution fixed at approximately 5 m. The higher sampling rate is compensated by\n\nthe fact that the echo window length needed to acquire the same swath is shorter in\n\nthe same proportion. However, there is an overhead due to the need to sample the\n\nentire pulse length, which given the 12% transmitter duty cycle of S1 results in a\n\nlarger total overhead for the near range beam. The total data volume, for 20 ? 20 km2\nvignettes is between 30 and 40 Gigabit/orbit, which is a relaxed requirement.\n\nFigure 2.24 provides a first-order performance analysis for PICOSAR. In partic-\n\nular, the analysis corresponds to a PICOSAR system flying in formation with ESA\u2019s\n\nFig. 2.22 Conceptual view of PICOSAR\u2019s multistatic configuration\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 113\n\n\n\nSentinel-1 mission. For the calculation of the velocity standard deviation versus the\n\nbaseline, the coherence times have been calculated according to the Pierson-\n\nMoskowitz wave spectrum [118, 119], which gives 83 and 43 ms for wind speeds\n\nof 2 and 12 m/s, respectively. The number of looks considered is 256, getting a final\n\nspatial resolution of 80 m both in range and in azimuth. For the estimation of the\n\nSNR, the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) is obtained using the CMOD5\n\n[120] model for an incidence angle of 23? for the upwind and crosswind cases and\nboth evaluated wind velocities. On the other hand, a Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero\n\nFig. 2.24 PICOSAR surface velocity estimation uncertainty (standard deviation) as a function of\n\nalong-track separation for different wind speeds and directions. A phase center separation between\n\nthe two PICOSAR satellites in the order of 100 m seems desirable\n\nFig. 2.23 Left: Data volume per orbit as a function of desired swath width for two incidence\nangles. Right: summary of main acquisition parameters\n\n114 P. Lo?pez-Dekker et al.\n\n\n\n(NESZ) of?17 dB is considered assuming a loss of 5 dB w.r.t. Sentinel-1 due to the\nsmaller receive antenna (a 2 m diameter reflector is assumed but a smaller antenna\n\nsize would also be possible at a slightly worse performance). The results show that\n\nan optimum baseline can be selected for each wind speed considered. Effective\n\nbaselines between 100 and 300 m show velocity accuracies well below the 0.1 m/\n\ns desired performance for the cases evaluated. An even better velocity accuracy is\n\nobtained for the crosswind case due to the higher NRCS obtained in this case.\n\n2.4.3.3 System Concept\n\nLike in the case of the Interferometric Cartwheel, the PICOSAR space segment is\n\nbuilt around a reflector based receiver architecture with a dual polarized feed, since\n\nS1 may transmit in vertical or horizontal polarization. A double pole double throw\n\nswitch between the dual polarization feed and a two channel RF front-end and\n\ndigitalization stage would make the receiver redundant and would also allow\n\nexperimental dual pol acquisitions. An antenna with a diameter between 1.5 and\n\n2.5 m would suffice to meet the mission requirements.\n\n2.4.3.4 PICOSAR Synchronization\n\nProbably the most challenging aspect of PICOSAR and similar mission concepts is\n\nthe synchronization. The along-track interferometry nature of the mission makes it\n\nextremely sensitive to systematic phase errors, which translate directly in a velocity\n\nestimate error. In contrast to cross-track interferometric mission concepts, there is\n\nlittle room for data based calibration of this phase. In order to meet the synchroni-\n\nzation requirements, the use of high quality USOs in combination with an explicit\n\nsynchronization link between the PICOSAR spacecraft is required.\n\nPrecise phase synchronization between S1 and both receive spacecraft is not\n\nrequired, since a phase offset will be common to both receivers and, therefore,\n\ncancel out in the ATI phase. However, very good relative frequency knowledge is a\n\nstrong requirement, since an unaccounted frequency offset will be interpreted as a\n\nDoppler frequency offset, which will introduce a systematic bias. The required\n\nrelative frequency knowledge is in the order of 1 Hz, which is within the expected\n\nshort term (one orbit) frequency stability of S1. Using acquisitions over land to\n\ncalibrate longer term relative frequency drifts, this implies that PICOSAR can meet\n\nits requirements without an explicit synchronization with S1.\n\n2.5 Conclusions\n\nThere is a wide range of applications for distributed multistatic radar missions.\n\nIndeed, many possible SAR applications benefit clearly, or even require, a\n\ndistributed system. The most evident examples are single-pass interferometric\n\n2 Multistatic Radar Systems 115\n\n\n\napplications and their multi-baseline or tomographic extensions, which require\n\nbaselines of orders of magnitude that are only realizable using a distributed SAR\n\nsystem employing two or more formation flying satellites. Their usefulness and\n\nfeasibility has been fully validated by the TanDEM-X mission that is currently in\n\noperation.\n\nMost appealing applications require that the multistatic system is designed like a\n\ntruly distributed but tightly integrated system, and not as a loose collection of\n\ncooperating independent sensors. Relatively tight and carefully designed\n\nformations are required in most cases, with strict requirements on the relative\n\nposition knowledge, which has to be in the order of a small fraction of the operating\n\nradar wavelength. Also, the systems need to be carefully synchronized, usually\n\nincluding a synchronization link as part of the payload.\n\nWhile TanDEM-X has inaugurated the era of multistatic radar missions with a\n\nfully-active system consisting of two nearly identical spacecraft, it is very likely\n\nthat in the near future semi-active mission concepts will develop. In particular, due\n\nto their low marginal cost, add-on mission concepts using two or three compact\n\nreceive-only spacecraft should be expected to be realized in the near future.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Relative motion model evolution from the\n\nfirst Hill\u2019s schematization (circular orbit, close satellites) is described, considering\n\nthe inclusion of chief\u2019s orbit eccentricity and orbital perturbations. In particular, the\n\ninclusion of J2-secular effects is treated in depth considering various approaches in\n\nliterature. Literature is also reviewed for both small and large eccentricities.\n\nFurther details are presented to model formations with small chief\u2019s eccentricity\n\n(order of 10?3), which are typical of Earth observation missions, for both the case of\nclose formations, i.e. with satellite distance of the order of tens of kilometers, and\n\nlarge formations, i.e. satellite distance up to hundreds of kilometers. Finally, design\n\napplications are presented, with derivation of relative trajectories from application\n\nrequirements. As an example, relative orbits for SAR interferometry are derived\n\nfrom the requested altitude measurement uncertainty and considering different\n\ncandidate geometries (pendulum, cartwheel, etc.). Relative orbits for SAR tomog-\n\nraphy and large baseline bistatic SAR applications are also analyzed.\n\nM.

Therefore, adequate modeling of orbital relative dynamics is the key to\n\nenable distributed missions. Hill\u2019s equations [1\u20133], developed in the ambit of Lunar\n\nresearch, are worldwide considered as the first schematization of orbital relative\n\nmotion, later independently replicated by Clohessy andWiltshire [4] and developed\n\nby many other authors in the ambit of rendezvous research (e.g. [5\u20137]). In this\n\nperspective, formation flying is quite an old theme because it has been studied since\n\nthe very beginning of manned space programs to develop rendezvous and docking\n\ntechnologies.\n\nIn the last couple of decades, new mission ideas have been arising, which foresee\n\nmultiple spacecraft system working for the entire lifetime in either close or loose\n\nproximity. It is then mission duration that makes modern formation flying different\n\nfrom rendezvous, leading to completely different requirements, including relative\n\nmotion schematization which needs further terms with respect to former models [8].\n\nThus, the description of relative motion on near circular orbits through linearized\n\ndifferential equations based on the assumptions of circular reference orbit,\n\nsmall relative distances, and spherical Earth [1\u20134] has been gradually improved.\n\nIn particular, one of the major error source is the Keplerian dynamics approxima-\n\ntion, which renders the solution useless on long timescales. J2 potential is the main\n\nperturbing effect in LEO, thus different approaches have been followed to incorpo-\n\nrate it. For example, Vadali et al. [9] and Wiesel [10] developed linearized time-\n\nvarying coefficients differential equations, while Schweighart and Sedwick [11]\n\nfound for a circular reference orbit a set of constant coefficient equations similar in\n\nform to Hill\u2019s equations, but able to capture Earth oblateness effects. It is worth\n\nnoting that only the latter model exhibits an analytical solution. More recently,\n\nrelative dynamics for near circular perturbed LEO orbits has been treated by Halsall\n\nand Palmer [12]. A significant research effort has also been performed in the case of\n\nreference orbits of arbitrary eccentricity [13\u201316]. Some of the undertaken efforts\n\nhave included analyses in the mean orbit element space. As an example, Schaub and\n\nAlfriend [17] defined J2-invariant orbits and Schaub et al. [18] analyzed formation\ncontrol. In addition, Schaub [19] studied the problem in the classical orbit elements\n\nspace under the assumption that all orbit parameter differences must be small, but\n\nwithout a time-explicit representation of relative motion. Finally, Fasano and\n\nD\u2019Errico [20] developed a model in the classical mean orbit element space which\n\noffers a time-explicit representation of relative trajectories.\n\nWhen one has to select or develop a dynamical model, a tradeoff is always\n\nneeded between completeness and complexity, which is even more critical when\n\nthe purpose is trajectory design. Complex models allow for a more realistic\n\nrepresentation of the motion, with the advantage of defining a nominal trajectory\n\nwhich inherently accounts for a large number of perturbations. Therefore, the\n\nefforts needed to control the real motion in the neighborhood of the nominal\n\ntrajectory are minimized. On the other hand, a strong modeling complexity can\n\n126 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\nspoil model usefulness because it makes difficult to explore all design possibilities\n\nby analytic or semi-analytic procedures (i.e. through an extensive parametric\n\nanalysis). As an example, for orbit design of classical, monolithic Earth observation\n\nmissions the current design practice builds on relatively simple analytical models\n\nwhich include the most relevant perturbations (e.g. J2 secular to define sun-\n\nsynchronous and/or repetitive orbits, J2 + J3 secular for frozen orbits) to define a\n\npreliminary orbit design to be successively verified by more complex numerical\n\ntools. Such models typically use classical mean orbit elements because, despite\n\ntheir weakness (singularities under special conditions), they offer a direct physical\n\nand geometrical interpretation of the design result.\n\nWith reference to relative trajectory design, it is a widespread opinion that\n\nClohessy and Wiltshire models are largely inadequate for modern formation design\n\nbecause they do not capture relative J2 perturbations and consequent relative drifts.\n\nIf a relative trajectory is designed with this model, the relative orbit control will be\n\nin practice fighting (and expelling propellant) against J2 differential perturbations.\n\nSuch disproportionate procedure would be equivalent to a design of Earth orbits\n\nunder Keplerian dynamics, with the orbit control designed to remove, among the\n\nother perturbations, ascending node and perigee precessions. Nonetheless, no\n\nstandard formation design practice has been assessed and agreed up to now,\n\nprobably because most of the huge literature contribution in the last decade, very\n\npartially summarized previously, has been mainly devoted to formation control\n\nrather than formation design. In this ambit, the first important contribution was\n\nproposed by Schaub and Alfriend [17, 21]. They introduced the concept of\n\nJ2-invariant relative orbits, i.e. obtained by means of deputy and chief orbital\n\nparameter differences (semi-major axis, inclination, and eccentricity) able to nullify\n\nmean relative drifts of ascending node right ascension and argument of latitude.\n\nTheir analysis showed that such concept may have some critical points when\n\nimplemented for near-polar orbits (when inclination is close to 90?) and for near\ncircular-orbits (when eccentricity approaches 0). In such cases in fact, a desired\n\ninclination difference usually leads to a large requirement on eccentricity differ-\n\nence, which in turn produces large relative trajectories.\n\nIn order to describe relative motion, satellites are typically defined as chief and\n\ndeputy. With this wording, it is implicitly assumed that the relative motion under\n\nanalysis is the one of the deputy with respect to the chief. Earth orbits of both\n\nsatellites are defined in the earth-centered inertial reference frame (Fig. 3.1),\n\nwhereas to model the relative motion a reference frame attached to the chief is\n\nneeded. The most typical choice is the Hill reference frame, which is rigorously\n\ndefined for chief circular orbits only as: origin in the chief center of mass, y-axis\n\ndirected along the velocity vector, x-axis along the radial direction, z-axis perpen-\n\ndicular to the angular plane (aligned with angular momentum to complete the right-\n\nhanded reference frame). Such definition can be easily generalized for chief elliptic\n\norbit by keeping the definition for the origin, x- and z-axis and by defining y-axis as\n\nthe one completing the right-handed reference frame, which leads to an y-axis in the\n\norbital plane and with positive projection along the chief velocity vector. The Hill\n\nreference frame is not to be confused with the widespread Local Horizon Local\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 127\n\n\n\nVertical (LHLV) reference frame, since xLHLV||y, yLHLV||?z, and zLHLV||?x. To\nlimit the complication of a reference frame moving with varying angular velocity\n\nand with y-axis forming a variable angle with respect to velocity vector, a fictitious\n\nsatellite on a circular orbit with the chief\u2019s semi-major axis is sometimes introduced\n\nas a reference point to describe both chief and deputy local motions.\n\nWith this background, the description of relative dynamics consists in deriving\n\nthe relative position of the deputy with respect to the chief as a function of time in\n\nthe generalized Hill reference frame once the \u201cabsolute\u201d motions are known (i.e.\n\nthe functions Rc(t) and Rd(t)). Instead, when formation is designed the issue is\n\nderiving Rd(t) on the basis of Rc(t) and a desired (application-dependent) r(t).\n\nOf course the \u201cdesired\u201d r(t) is to be traded with Earth gravity field since, as it is well\n\nknown in standard orbit design, fighting against mother nature is not cost effective.\n\nRelative motion models can be roughly grouped into two families depending if they\n\nare developed either using Cartesian coordinates in the Hill reference frame or\n\norbital parameters differences (but a few hybrid approaches have also been pro-\n\nposed). If on the one hand it is extremely difficult to give general statements, on the\n\nother hand a logical rule of thumb consists in utilizing the latter models for\n\nformation design, whereas Cartesian coordinate models are better suited for control\n\nproblems.\n\nIn the following, the formation design problem for small eccentricity chief orbits is\n\ndiscussed in Sect. 3.2, while an overview of the works developed for large eccentricity\n\norbits is presented in Sect. 3.3. It is worth noting that Sect. 3.2 covers both the class\n\nof near-circular and small eccentricity orbits as defined by Schaub [19].\n\nFig. 3.1 Geometry and\n\nreference frames to describe\n\nrelative motion (r) of the\n\ndeputy satellite (position Rd\nin the geocentric inertial\n\nreference frame, XYZ) with\n\nrespect to the chief satellites\n\n(position, Rc; inclination, i;\n\nascending node right\n\nascension, O; angular\nmomentum, h; line-of-node\n\nvector, n) in the Hill reference\n\nframe (xyz)\n\n128 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\n3.2 Relative Trajectory Modeling: Small Eccentricity Orbits\n\nRelative motion in small eccentricity orbits has special interest for distributed space\n\nsystems. From the application point of view, their majority require circular or near\n\ncircular orbits: in typical remote sensing missions, the eccentricity is at most of the\n\norder of 10?3 and it is usually set to achieve sun-synchronous and/or frozen orbits\n[22]. In addition, from the dynamics point of view, relative trajectories in small\n\neccentricity formations exhibit some simple features which are gradually lost for an\n\nincreasing eccentricity. Finally, from the mathematics point of view, motion\n\ndescription is greatly simplified by the fact that the developments in power series\n\nof eccentricity can be arrested at first order. This aspect becomes even more\n\nimportant when dealing with trajectory design.\n\nA key point for relative trajectory modeling is related to the distance (baseline)\n\nbetween satellites. As a rule of thumb, if it is of the order of 1/1,000 of the absolute\n\norbit semi-major axis, one can likely consider a linearization of the problem,\n\nneglecting higher order effects. This is especially true for design purposes, where\n\nmodeling complexity has to be carefully traded off against model applicability.\n\nIn practical terms, in the case of typical Earth observation missions flying in LEO, a\n\n\u201cclose formation\u201d is characterized by a baseline of the order of a few kilometers,\n\nwhile \u201clarge formations\u201d foresee baselines of hundreds of kilometers. Even in low\n\neccentricity cases, large formations require inclusion of second order terms for\n\nproper motion modeling. Close and large formations are treated in separate sub-\n\nsections in the following.\n\n3.2.1 \u201cClose\u201d Formations\n\nWithin the huge amount of literature on the dynamics of close formations in small\n\neccentricity and circular/quasi circular orbits, papers and research approaches are\n\nconsidered here, which can be most useful for the formation designer. As already\n\nstated in the introduction, the simplest model to describe deputy motion with\n\nrespect to the chief in terms of relative position and velocity coordinates is\n\nrepresented by Hill\u2019s equations, also called Clohessy-Wiltshire equations (HCW)\n\n[1\u20134]. HCW equations are based on the assumptions of central gravitational field as\n\nthe only external force, Keplerian circular orbit for the chief satellite, small distance\n\nbetween chief and deputy. They can be derived by writing the dynamic equation of\n\nthe deputy with respect to the chief and then linearizing the gravitational accelera-\n\ntion around the chief position. In typical cases, HCW modeling error tends to\n\nincrease with time because of the underlying assumptions. Hill\u2019s equations can be\n\nderived in differential form as follows:\n\nx\n::?2n y: ?3n2x \u00bc 0\ny\n::\u00fe2n x: \u00bc 0\nz\n::\u00fen2z \u00bc 0\n\n8><\n>: (3.1)\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 129\n\n\n\nwhere n is the Keplerian mean motion of the chief satellite.\nThese linear constant coefficients differential equations admit an analytical\n\nsolution that is, considering all the terms:\n\nx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u00f0x: 0=n\u00de sin\u00f0nt\u00de ? \u00f03x0 \u00fe 2 y0\n:\n=n\u00de cos\u00f0nt\u00de \u00fe 4x0 \u00fe 2y: 0=n\n\ny\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u00f02x: 0=n\u00de cos\u00f0nt\u00de \u00fe \u00f06x0 \u00fe 4y: 0=n\u00de sin\u00f0nt\u00de ? \u00f06nx0 \u00fe 3y\n:\n\n0\u00det? 2x\n:\n0=n\u00fe y0\n\nz\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u00f0z:0=n\u00de sin\u00f0nt\u00de \u00fe z0 cos\u00f0nt\u00de\n\n8><\n>:\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe main features of relative motion can be straightforwardly understood from\n\nthe solution. First of all, relative trajectory is a plane trajectory and its projection on\n\nthe radial/along-track plane is a 2 ? 1 ellipse, i.e., an ellipse with fixed eccentricity.\nAll the oscillating terms are at orbital frequency, and in particular while the z\n\ncoordinate exhibits a simple harmonic oscillation, an offset term appears in the\n\nradial coordinate, and both an offset and a linear secular drift appear in the y\n\ncoordinate. It is worth noting that the along-track drift is directly proportional to\n\nthe radial offset.\n\nIn HCW modeling framework, stable relative motion can be obtained if\n\ny\n:\n\n0 \u00bc ?2x0n\n\nThe origin of this behavior can be better appreciated if relative trajectory is\n\ndescribed in terms of orbital parameters and their differences.\n\nSeveral approaches can be found in literature to derive the equations describing\n\nrelative motion in the case of close formations: for example, Schaub [19] starts from\n\na linear mapping between Cartesian Hill coordinates and orbit elements differences\n\n[23], Fasano and D\u2019Errico [20, 24] and Vadali et al. [25] first write the exact relative\nmotion equations in terms of differences in orbital parameters, then apply a series of\n\nsimplifying assumptions.\n\nLet us first consider the case of chief moving on a circular orbit.\n\nIn the following, the subscript D will refer to deputy, while no subscripts will be\nused for chief parameters and the symbol d will represent the difference between\ndeputy and chief parameters.\n\nThe different approaches are all based on the assumption that all the differences\n\nin orbit parameters are very small, i.e., da/a, dO, di, de (i.e. eD) and oD + MD0?u0\nare <<1. u0 represents the initial value of chief anomaly computed with respect to\nits ascending node (that is, chief\u2019s initial argument of latitude). In the following, in\n\ngeneral u will represent the mean argument of latitude, i.e., u \u00bc o + M.\nRelative motion equations in terms of orbital parameters, under Keplerian\n\ndynamics and with the chief true anomaly as independent variable can be written\n\nas proposed by Schaub [19]:\n\n130 M.

Comparison of these equation sets puts in evidence the\n\norigin of the HCW terms, In particular:\n\n1. The radial offset is due to the difference in semi-major axes;\n\n2. The harmonic in-plane oscillations are linearly related to deputy orbit eccentric-\n\nity (de \u00bc eD);\n3. The along-track offset depends on the initial difference in (mean) argument of\n\nlatitude;\n\n4. The cross-track oscillation can be activated by means of a difference in right\n\nascension of the ascending node or inclination. The latter allows to achieve\n\nmaximum separation at the poles and minimum on the equator, the other way\n\nround for the former;\n\n5. In general (Earth oblateness effects included), the along track drift can be due to\n\nthe differential effects d u\n:\nand dO\n\n:\n\n. These terms will be further discussed later.\n\nThe equations written in terms of orbit parameters clearly show that the in-plane\n\nmotion is phased relative to the perigee (mean anomaly), while the out of plane\n\nmotion is phased relative to the ascending node (argument of latitude). Thus, the in-\n\nplane and the out-of-plane oscillations will have the same frequency as long as\n\nperigee precession is neglected (Keplerian dynamics) or nullified.\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 131\n\n\n\nLet us now consider the equations of relative motion which are applicable when\n\nthe chief does not move on a circular orbit but on a low eccentricity orbit. From an\n\napplication point if view, this means that the nominal orbit eccentricity is of the\n\norder of 10?3 (consider for example sun-synchronous frozen orbits [22]), which\nallows a linear approximation of terms related to eccentricity.\n\nOne interesting aspect to be considered is that, as noticed in Ref. [24] and then by\n\nVadali et al. [25], in a low eccentricity close formation case the difference in mean\nanomaly and in argument of perigee is not necessarily small, although the sum of\n\ntheir differences shall be.\n\nIn time explicit form one can derive the equations [20]:\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\n2\n64\n3\n75ffi a\n\nda\na ?decos\u00f0M0\u00fedM0\u00fe _MDt\u00de\u00fe2esin dM02\n\n? ?\nsin M0\u00fe _MDt\u00fe dM02\n? ?\n\n2desin\u00f0M0\u00fedM0\u00fe _MDt\u00de\u00fe4esin dM02 cos M0\u00fe dM02 \u00fe _MDt\n? ?\n\n\u00fed\u00f0o0\u00feM0\u00de\u00fedO0 cos i\u00fe t d _u\u00fed _Ocos i\n? ?\n\n?\u00f0dO0\u00fed _O t\u00desin icos\u00f0oD0\u00feMD0\u00fe _uDt\u00de\u00fed isin\u00f0oD0\u00feMD0\u00fe _uDt\u00de\n\n2\n666664\n\n3\n777775\n\n(3.6)\n\nVadali et al. [25] derive similar equations, with the in-plane terms arranged in a\ndifferent way and with some second order terms in the cross-track coordinate:\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\n2\n64\n3\n75ffia\n\nda\na \u00fe eD sindM\u00f0 \u00desinM\u00fe e?eDcosdM\u00f0 \u00decosM\u00bd ?\n\ndu\u00fedOcos i?e eD sindM\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\u00fe2 ? e?eDcosdM\u00f0 \u00desinM\u00fe eD sindM\u00f0 \u00decosM\u00bd ?\n\ndisinuD?sin idOcosuD? 32e disinoD?sin idOcosoD\u00f0 \u00de\n\n2\n66664\n\n3\n77775\n\n(3.7)\n\nIf one compares the in-plane terms in (3.6) and (3.5), at first order a new\n\nharmonic term appears both in the radial and in the along-track coordinate which\n\nis due to the difference in mean anomaly between satellites and is linearly related to\n\nchief eccentricity. For example, considering the along-track coordinate, this oscil-\n\nlation has an amplitude of 4e sin dM0\n2\n\nwhile the phase difference with respect to the\n\nother harmonic term related to de is p\n2\n? dM0\n\n2\n. Thus, it is important to underline that\n\ncontrary to the de-induced oscillation, dM impacts both the amplitude and the phase\n(with respect to the perigee) of this harmonic motion. When a small anomaly\n\ndifference between the satellites exists, the dM-dependent term is of higher order\nand thus can be neglected. Thus, the in-plane motion is a combination of two\n\nharmonic oscillations both in the radial and in the along-track coordinate, which\n\ncan be graphically explained if one considers a virtual reference point which moves\n\non a circular orbit sharing all chief orbital parameters except eccentricity (and of\n\ncourse, in time, true anomaly). Figure 3.2 describes chief and deputy motion with\n\nrespect to this virtual platform. Since at first order the Hill\u2019s reference frame of the\n\nreference point is aligned with the chief\u2019s Hill reference frame, one can easily find\n\nout the two harmonic contributions.\n\n132 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\nEquation 3.6 also shows how the deputy perigee position influences the way the\n\nin-plane motion is phased relative to the cross track oscillation: for example,\n\nFig. 3.3 shows what happens if the chief perigee is placed at 0?, at 45? or at 90?,\nand a difference in eccentricity is combined with a difference in right ascension of\n\nthe ascending node. Modifying the relative phasing of in-plane and out-of-plane\n\noscillations changes the xz and yz projections, which can be ellipses, circles or\n\nlines, while the relative trajectory always lies on the surface of an elliptic cylinder\n\nwith axis along the cross-track direction [26].\n\nConsidering mean orbit parameters and secular Earth oblateness effects, both\n\nabsolute and differential J2 effects on relative trajectory are of particular interest to\n\nthe formation designer.\n\nFrom Ref.

As a result, even in\n\nabsence of differential effects, the relative trajectory as seen from ground will\n\nmodify.\n\nThis conclusion was first pointed out by Sabol et al. [28] heuristically, referring to\n\nthe circular formation, and then by Schweighart and Sedwick [11], Fasano and\n\nD\u2019Errico [24], Vadali et al. [25]. In other terms, since as stated above the radial/\nalong-track motion is phased relative to the perigee, while the cross-track motion is\n\nphased relative to the nodal crossings, in general out-of-plane and in-plane coordinates\n\nwill oscillate with different periods. D\u2019Amico and Montenbruck [29] also noted such\n\neffect which is defined as the rotation of the relative eccentricity vector.\n\nAmong other things, the difference in the two frequencies also emphasizes the\n\nfact that the relative trajectory does not depend only on the difference of mean\n\norbital parameters, but also on the absolute parameters of the chief satellite.

Since e \u00bc O(10?3), then we have CO,a \u00bc CO,i \u00bc O(10?3 n),\nCO,e \u00bc O(10?6 n), Cu,a \u00bc O(n), Cu,i \u00bc O(10?3 n), Cu,e \u00bc O(10?6 n).\n\nOf course, Cu,a is the largest coefficient because of the Keplerian term included.\n\nIn terms of the along-track coordinate, a residual da implies an along-track drift of\nthe order of ?3pda per orbit. This term is explicitly cited in (3.3). Eccentricity\ncoefficients are the smallest ones and nullify if the chief is on circular orbit.\n\nIn practical terms this means that really small differential effects are activated by\n\ndifferences in eccentricity.\n\nFinally, node precession rate and mean angular velocity show a significant\n\ndependency on di, and the chief orbit inclination determines the relative weight\nof CO,i, CO,a, Cu,i. In fact, in the case of near polar orbits, precession rate is very\n\nsensitive to the inclination while CO,a, Cu,i tend to vanish.\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 135\n\n\n\nEquations (3.6) and ((3.11), (3.12), (3.13)) can be used in a twofold way by the\n\norbit designer. First, it is possible to quantitatively estimate formation stability in\n\ncase of non J2-invariant formations. On the other hand, the coefficients allow the\n\ntrajectory designer to understand the most efficient ways of modifying relative\n\ntrajectory by taking advantage of Earth oblateness effects.\n\nMean orbit parameters and secular J2 effects have been considered in this\n\ndiscussion. Of course, actual formation dynamics is also driven by short-periodic\n\nand long-periodic effects [29]. These effects usually have to be taken into account\n\nwhen dealing with formation control, and analytical approaches exist which allow\n\nmapping osculating parameters to the corresponding mean elements [8, 26, 29]. On\n\nthe other hand, it is also worth noting that relative motion as estimated on the basis\n\nof mean orbit parameters is different from averaged relative motion [30], due to the\n\nnon linear relations involved. In practical terms, however, both these effects can be\n\nconsidered as higher order terms which can be likely neglected in the formation\n\ndesign phase.\n\nIt is useful to arrange the relative motion equations in order to put in evidence the\n\ndesign parameters for relative motion geometry.

In fact, Keplerian and J2 gravity field harmonics\n\n(included in the model) should not disrupt the formation on a short timescale.\n\nTherefore, the semi-major axis is the most critical parameter since its variation\n\nmodifies both Keplerian mean motion and J2 effects (ascending node and perigee\n\nprecession rates, and perturbed mean motion). Then, if nearly circular orbits are\n\nconsidered, it is worth noting that inclination is the parameter with major impact on\n\nJ2 effects, while eccentricity has a minor influence as demonstrated in (3.12).\n\nIn addition, J2 effects do not depend on argument of perigee, mean anomaly, and\n\nright ascension of the ascending node. The problem can be also analyzed from\n\nanother point of view. Differential J2 effects cause drifts on ascending node,\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 137\n\n\n\nperigee, and mean anomaly, with absolute values of dO, do, and dM increasing\nwith time. If the model does not allow dO, do, and dM to be large enough, it could\nbe useless after a relatively short time. As a consequence, the non-dimensional\n\ndifference in semi-major axis (da/a) must be designed as the smallest parameter,\nwhile all the other parameter differences are larger, with di in-between.\n\nOn the basis of these considerations the following assumptions can be made:\n\n\u2013 Retain only linear and quadratic terms for dO, od0 + Md0?u0, d _ut \u00bc d _M \u00fe _o\n? ?\n\nt\n\u2013 Retain only linear terms for di\n\u2013 All mixed terms given by the product of two orbital parameter differences taken\n\ninto account, apart from the ones containing da/a.\n\nConsidering these assumptions, Fasano and D\u2019Errico derived the following set\n\nof equations [20]:\n\nx\n\na\nffi da\n\na\n? de cos MD0 \u00fe _MDt\n\n? ?\u00fe 2e sin dM0\n2\n\n? ?\nsin M0 \u00fe dM0\n\n2\n\u00fe _MDt\n\n? ?\n\n\u00fe e d _MDt\n? ?\n\nsin M0 \u00fe _MDt\n? ?? du0\u00f0 \u00de2\n\n2\n? d _u t\u00f0 \u00de\n\n2\n\n2\n? du0 ? d _u t\n\n? eD du0 \u00fe d _u t\u00f0 \u00de2 sin MD0 \u00fe _MDt\n? ?? dO cos i?\n\ndu0 \u00fe d _ut\u00fe 2eD sin MD0 \u00fe _MDt\n? ?\n ?\u00fe ? dO2\n\n2\n\u00fe dO\n\n2\n\n4\nsin2i\n\n? ?\n\n? dO\n2\n\n4\nsin2i cos x\u00fe 1\n\n2\ndOdi sin i sin x\u00fe 2e sin M0 \u00fe _Mt\n\n? ?\n ?\ndu0 \u00fe d _u t\u00fe dO cos i\u00f0 \u00de (3.17)\n\ny\n\na\nffi du0 \u00fe d _u t\u00fe dO cos i\u00fe 2de sin MD0 \u00fe _MDt\n\n? ?\u00fe 4e sin dM0\n2\n\n? ?\n\ncos M0 \u00fe dM0\n2\n\n\u00fe _MDt\n? ?\n\n\u00fe 2e d _M t? ? cos M0 \u00fe _MDt? ?\n? ed du0 \u00fe d _u t\u00f0 \u00de cos Md0 \u00fe _MDt\n\n? ?? dO cos i ed cos Md0 \u00fe _MDt? ?\n? 1\n2\ndOd i sin i\u00fe dO\n\n2\n\n4\nsin2i ? sin x\u00fe 1\n\n2\ndOdi sin i cos x (3.18)\n\nz\n\na\nffi ?dO sin i cosC\u00fe di sinC? dOeD sin i\n\n1\n\n2\ncos 2MD0 \u00fe oD0 \u00fe _MDt\u00fe _uDt\n? ?? 3\n\n2\ncos oD0 \u00fe _oDt\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\t \n\n\n\u00fe d i eD 1\n2\nsin 2MD0 \u00fe oD0 \u00fe _MDt\u00fe _uDt\n? ?? 3\n\n2\nsin oD0 \u00fe _oDt\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\t \n\n\n\u00fe dO\n2\n\n2\nsin i cos i sinC (3.19)\n\n138 M.

When the satellites\u2019 separation\n\ngrows, as shown in the second order model all coordinates are coupled. On the\n\nother hand, da only appears as an offset in the radial coordinate because of\npreviously reported assumptions;\n\n\u2013 Secular terms also appear in the radial coordinate at second order;\n\n\u2013 All the coordinates are the sum of different functions of time: constant offsets,\n\nlinear and quadratic terms, long period oscillations due to perigee precession and\n\nother periodic terms with constant or time-varying amplitude. As for the latter\n\nones, it is interesting to note that some terms appear in x and y whose frequency\n\nis twice the orbital one (3.17 and 3.18);\n\n\u2013 In typical cases, not all the terms in (3.17), (3.18), and (3.19) are of the same\n\norder of magnitude, and some can be neglected. For example, if the relative\n\ntrajectory is \u201cslowly\u201d modified by differential J2 effects (deviation in position\n\nover tens of orbits non significant in percentage), all the second order terms\n\ncontaining secular factors can be likely neglected.\n\n3.3 Relative Trajectory Modeling: Elliptic Orbits\n\nwith Arbitrary Eccentricity\n\nAlfriend et al. [26] give an overview and comparisons of some proposed models of\nrelative motion with respect to elliptic reference orbits, which are basically classi-\n\nfied on the grounds of the selected independent variable. In particular, Melton\u2019s\n\nmodel [31] is developed in both a Cartesian and a cylindrical coordinate system\n\nattached to the chief. Relative position is expressed as a function of time thanks to\n\nan expansion in powers of eccentricity. Another family of relative motion models\n\nutilizes true anomaly as independent variable and it is based on the former inde-\n\npendent developments by Lawden [32], de Vries [33], Tshauner and Hempel [7].\n\nThese latter models have been then additionally developed by Carter [13], who\n\nfound new formulations of Lawden\u2019s solutions and succeeded in removing\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 139\n\n\n\nsingularities in true anomaly. In addition, Yamanaka and Ankersen [34] found an\n\nadditional, independent solution of Lawden\u2019s equations.\n\nInalhan et al. [35] reconstruct relative dynamics between two eccentric orbits\nand identify a solution which, for homogeneous equation (i.e. in Keplerian dynam-\n\nics), coincides with the solutions identified by Lawden/Carter. They also analyze a\n\nset of initial conditions able to guarantee periodicity of relative trajectories. The\n\nfirst proposed condition coincides with the well-known equal-energy (i.e. semi-\n\nmajor axis) requirement, which is also a clear outcome of HCW equations.\n\nIn addition, Inalhan et al. also propose different conditions to avoid relative drift\nwhich depends on a set of four constants. Finally, a simulation is presented, which\n\nshows that neglecting chief eccentricity (of the order of 10?3) has an effect on in-\nplane drift larger than neglecting J2 differential perturbation. The simulations are\n\nperformed at an inclination of 52?, which could partly explain such result.\nKetema [36] also proposes an analytical model for Keplerian relative motion\n\nbetween two elliptic orbits. Method peculiarity consists in the definition of a set of\n\nrelative orbital parameters of the deputy in the chief perifocal reference frame,\n\nwhereas the time dependence of true anomaly and time is solved numerically.\n\nModeling J2 effects on the new set of orbital parameters is needed if the method\n\nneeds to be extended.\n\nLane and Axelrad [37] present a geometrical method to describe relative motion\n\nwith time as independent variable, building on previous derivations by Broucke\n\n[38]. The proposed method is based on the description of the relative motions as a\n\nfunction of chief\u2019s true anomaly and o the orbital parameter differences, which are\n\nall assumed small. Applications of the method are presented to design typical\n\nformations (in-track, follower, in-track/cross-track), with an approach similar to\n\nthe one presented in Sect. 3.2. Relative motion is modeled for Keplerian dynamics,\n\nwhich makes the model accurate over short time intervals.\n\nRelative position of the deputy with respect to the chief is expressed by Schaub\n\n[19] as a function of orbital parameter differences, with eccentricity and perigee\n\ngeneralized in order to avoid singularities, and chief\u2019s true anomaly. Schaub [19]\n\nprovides relative motion models for either arbitrary or small eccentricity (discussed\n\nin Sect. 3.2) chief\u2019s orbits. Therefore, the sixth relative parameter is selected as the\n\ndifference between chief and deputy mean anomalies, which is constant for orbits\n\nwith the same energy. J2 effects can be incorporated adequately modeling time\n\ndependence or orbital parameter differences.\n\nIn their analysis, Sengupta and Vadali [39] working with curvilinear coordinates\n\nin the LHLV reference frame of the chief and expanding a previous work by\n\nSengupta et al. [40], show relations between Lawden\u2019s solutions and the ones\nobtained with the orbital parameter difference approach. They extensively analyze\n\nthe effect of chief eccentricity putting in evidence that it introduces a number\n\nof variations with respect to the classical solution of the HCW equations: (a)\n\noscillations at frequency higher than the orbital one; (b) enlargement of relative\n\ntrajectory in cross-track and shrinkage in along-track; (c) phase shift; (d) displace-\n\nment of relative trajectory center with respect to the LHLV reference frame origin.\n\n140 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, a chief\u2019s orbit with an arbitrary eccentricity adds complications to\n\nthe description of relative motion even in Keplerian dynamics. Therefore, simplifi-\n\ncation of the relative motion model to allow a straightforward design process is still\n\nunder debate, with Schaub [19] probably offering the best option. Nonetheless,\n\nsince the vast majority of current ideas for distributed missions for Earth\n\nobservations utilize low eccentricity orbits, this limitation has limited practical\n\nimpact in the present.\n\n3.4 Relative Trajectory Design\n\n3.4.1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry\n\nAs described in detail in Chaps. 1 and 2, single pass cross-track interferometry\n\n[41, 42] builds on two antennas, one transmitting and both receiving the\n\nbackscattered echoes (transmission can be switched from one antenna to the other\n\nat each impulse), and allows one to build a three-dimensional model of observed\n\nareas.\n\nThe basic formation parameter which determines observation geometry and\n\nachievable performance in Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation is the so-\n\ncalled \u201ceffective baseline\u201d, which is the projection of the baseline vector onto the\n\nnormal of the radar viewing direction (Fig. 3.4).\n\nGiven a radar look angle y the effective baseline is a linear combination of the\nvertical (along the x-axis, radial) and the horizontal (along the z-axis, cross-track)\n\nbaseline ( x sin#? z cos#j j).\nThe effective baseline is usually chosen on the basis of a trade-off between\n\nheight reconstruction accuracy and height of ambiguity [42], thus depending on\n\nradar wavelength. The height of ambiguity is defined as the altitude difference that\n\ngenerates an interferometric phase change of 2p after interferogram flattening.\nIn fact, although larger baselines allow better height measurement sensitivity,\n\nspatial decorrelation determines larger phase measurement noise, and moreover\n\nheight of ambiguity decreases, which is a drawback especially in areas with steep\n\nslopes.\n\nFor given system parameters and effective baseline, both height accuracy and\n\nheight of ambiguity are roughly proportional to radar wavelength. This is clearly\n\nshown in Fig. 3.5 where X-band, C-band and L-band SAR are considered (the chief\n\nsatellite is considered as transmitting/receiving, while the deputy is receiving only),\n\nheight accuracy models in literature are used [43, 44], and realistic values are\n\nassumed for the other parameters (altitude 600 km, signal-to-noise ratio 15 dB,\n\n4 looks, radar range resolution 5 m).\n\nIt is worth underlining that only phase noise has been considered in evaluating\n\nheight accuracy. Uncertainties in slant range, baseline components, and attitude\n\nalso affect height accuracy but are not considered here because they depend on the\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 141\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_2\n\n\nradial axis (x)\n\nchief\nsatellite \n\ncross-track\naxis (z) \n\ndeputy \nsatellite\n\neffective baseline\n\ndirection of\nincidence \n\nnormal to the\ndirection of\nincidence  \n\n?\n\nFig. 3.4 Geometry to evaluate effective baseline (Reproduced with kind permission from\n\nSpringer Science+Business Media B.V. # 2009 Springer Published in Ref.

Nevertheless it must be noted that phase noise effect is the main\n\nsource of error, provided that baseline is very accurately estimated (millimetric\n\nlevel).\n\nOn the basis of this type of budgets, an \u201coptimal\u201d value (or, more practically, an\n\nacceptable range) of the effective baseline can be usually identified, and orbit\n\ndesign is aimed at achieving this baseline range at the required latitudes. In fact,\n\norbital motion produces a continuous change of effective baseline and a different\n\nrange of latitudes where the given performance is achieved, depending on forma-\n\ntion geometry. Thus, different candidate formation geometries must designed and\n\ntraded against effective baseline performance and orbit stability.\n\nLet us refer to the dynamics of close formations on small eccentricity orbits\n\n(3.6). First of all, it is interesting to note that two sinusoidal oscillations (in general\n\nat slightly different frequency) with zero offset have to be combined. In fact, it is\n\nnot realistic to impose an offset in the radial coordinate which would result in\n\nformation instability over short timescales. Thus, for any choice of the orbital\n\nparameters, the effective baseline has a sinusoidal trend as a function of time.\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the designer are the amplitude and the phase of the\n\noscillation with respect to latitude. If cross-track component is designed by means\n\nof di, an undesired cross-track instability (3.12) is a drawback. Thus, horizontal\nmotion has to be obtained by means of dO, which leads to an effective baseline\nvariation from the equator (maximum) to the poles (zero), depending on the radar\n\noff-nadir angle. On the other hand, the same trend is obtained in both the ascending\n\nand descending phases of the orbit. Because of the oscillation of the deputy around\n\nan axis parallel to the cross-track axis, this formation is usually known as \u201cpendu-\n\nlum\u201d. Usually, an offset in the along-track coordinate is also foreseen for safety\n\nreasons, which can be obtained by a dM (or a do). Both orbits can have some\n(common) eccentricity without effects on relative motion.\n\nIf [Bmin Bmax] is the required range of effective baseline, then from (3.6) the dO\nto maximize the useful orbit fraction can be calculated as\n\nadO sin i cos# \u00bc Bmax (3.22)\n\nIn terms of latitude coverage, this type of formation does not allow achieving the\n\ndesired baselines at high latitudes. An example of this effect is shown in Fig. 3.6.\n\nAn alternative option is the exploitation of the vertical oscillation only, which\n\ncan be achieved by utilizing either a de or opposite differences in dM and do with\nnon zero chief eccentricity. Again, the orbit fraction where the required range of\n\neffective baselines is achieved can be maximized. For example, if a difference in\n\neccentricity is selected, we can impose\n\nade sin# \u00bc Bmax (3.23)\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 143\n\n\n\nWhile, if we impose differences in mean anomaly and argument of perigee (for\n\nsmall eccentricity orbits), we have\n\n2ae sin\ndM0\n2\n\n? ?\nsin# \u00bc Bmax (3.24)\n\nIn both cases, the motion is phased relative to the perigee. Thus the latitude trend\n\ndepends on the argument of perigee, with perigee precession modifying the latitude\n\ncoverage. This type of formation is usually known as \u201ccartwheel\u201d [45, 46], and the\n\nrelative trajectory is on the 2 ? 1 in plane ellipse of Hill\u2019s equations (Fig. 3.7)\nwhile the effective baseline trend as a function of latitude is depicted in Fig. 3.8 for\n\nthe two different values for the argument of perigee.\n\nIf a de-based cartwheel is considered, it is interesting to observe that when the\nargument of perigee is 90?, the same effective baseline trend is achieved in the\nascending and in the descending phase of the orbit, which is complementary with\n\nrespect to the pendulum effect: the effective baseline is now maximum at the poles\n\nand nullifies at the equator. Instead, when the perigee lies at intermediate latitudes\n\n(e.g., 45?), then different trends are achieved in the different phases of the orbit, and\n\n\u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0 20 40 60 80\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\nlatitude (\u00b0)\n\nef\nfe\n\nct\niv\n\ne \nba\n\nse\nlin\n\ne\n\nFig. 3.6 Effective baseline as a function of latitude for a pendulum formation (COSMO/SkyMed\n\nconsidered as chief orbit, dO \u00bc 4.9 ? 10?3)\n\n144 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\nall the achievable latitudes can be covered with a relatively small effective baseline\n\npercentage variation.\n\nFinally, vertical and horizontal oscillations can be combined. Since horizontal\n\nmotion has to be necessarily obtained by means of a difference in right ascension of\n\nthe ascending node, the argument of perigee and the choice of eccentricity, de, dM\nand do, determines the vertical motion and the relative phasing of the two\noscillations, which in turn influence the latitude trend of the effective baseline\n\nand the trajectory shape in the radial/cross-track plane. A common choice in remote\n\nsensing orbits is to place the perigee at 90? to achieve sun-synchronous frozen\norbits [22]. If this is the case, then imposing a slight difference in eccentricity and\n\nno differences in perigee and mean anomaly allows obtaining a vertical oscillation\n\nwith a phase difference of 90? with respect to the horizontal motion. This implies\nthat the resulting trajectory in the radial-cross-track plane is an ellipse whose\n\nprincipal directions coincide with the coordinate axes and whose semi-minor and\n\nsemi-major axes depend linearly on dO and de, respectively. This formation is\nusually called \u201chelix\u201d and has found application in the TanDEM-X mission (Chap.\n\n13). Helix formations are characterized by the fact that the separation in the radial/\n\ncross-track plane never nullifies. This means that the baseline between the satellites\n\nis never purely an along-track separation, which is an advantage for collision\n\navoidance and relaxes formation control requirements.\n\n\u20131000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\u20132000\n\n\u20131500\n\n\u20131000\n\n\u2013500\n\n0\n\n500\n\nalong-track (m)cross-track (m)\n\nra\ndi\n\nal\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nFig. 3.7 3d relative trajectory and projections on the coordinate planes for a cartwheel formation\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 145\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_13\n\n\nThen, as in the cartwheel case for intermediate values of the argument of\n\nperigee, all the latitudes can be observed with similar effective baseline, provided\n\nthat the difference in right ascension of the ascending node and eccentricity are\n\nproperly selected.\n\nEffective baseline can be expressed as a function of time as:\n\nBeff \u00bc a x sin#? zcos#j j\nffi a ?decos M0\u00fe _MDt\n\n? ?\nsin#\u00fe\u00f0dO0\u00fe d _O t\u00de sin icos\u00f090? \u00feM0\u00fe _uDt\u00decos#\n\n?? ??\n(3.25)\n\nConsidering that the difference between _MD and _uD is _oD (three orders of\nmagnitude less than _MD), Beff is the sum of two cosines with different amplitude,\n90? phase shift, and very near frequency.

In the pendulum case, perigee precession has no effect either on latitude\n\ncoverage or on formation geometry, whereas for cartwheel formations, perigee\n\nprecession changes the latitude belts where given performance is achieved, without\n\nchanging the relative trajectory. Finally, in the helix case, perigee precession\n\nchanges both the effective baseline values and the latitude dependence. In fact, if\n\nperigee moves away from 90?, the minimum separation in the radial-cross track\nplane decreases and then nullifies for o \u00bc 0? or o \u00bc 180?. That is, the helix\nadvantage of non intersecting orbits is then lost. Figure 3.11 describes the effect\n\nof perigee precession on a helix formation, pointing out the modifications in relative\n\ntrajectory and effective baseline trend.\n\nTable 3.1 summarizes the different characteristics of the described formations.\n\nPrevious considerations about interferometry requirements and formation\n\ngeometries can be used together in an example of trajectory design.

That aperture is\n\nsynthesized by processing properly several SAR images of the same area gathered\n\nwith (slightly) different off-nadir/incidence angles (Chap. 2).

Spaceborne SAR tomography is currently an open research theme, and\n\na quantitative analysis of the relevant trade-offs is under investigation by the\n\nscientific community.\n\nAs in cross-track interferometry, the basic geometry parameter for SAR tomog-\n\nraphy is the effective baseline. In fact, the receivers have to properly sample the\n\neffective baseline along an interval that defines the tomographic aperture\n\n(Fig. 3.12).\n\nUsing mathematical models developed in Refs. [48, 50] and on the basis of the\n\nscenario depicted in Fig. 3.12, defining l as the wavelength, R0 as the slant range,\nand y as the local incidence angle (Eqs. 3.26\u20133.29 only), one can derive that the\nmaximum effective baseline is determined by the desired height resolution, Dh:\n\nB? \u00bc lR0 sin yDh (3.26)\n\nwhile the distance among the satellites is limited by the necessity to avoid\n\nambiguities in the tomographic reconstruction. Hence, if H is the desired unambig-\nuous height, it must be:\n\nDB? \u00bc lR0 sin y\nH\n\n(3.27)\n\nH and Dh also determine the number of required satellites in a single-pass\nscenario:\n\nN \u00bc 1\u00fe B?\nDB?\n\n\u00bc 1\u00fe H\nDh\n\n(3.28)\n\nFig. 3.12 Tomographic\n\ngeometry for a satellite\n\nformation of bistatic SAR\n\nsensors (small dots) teamed\nwith a monostatic SAR\n\n(large dot)\n\n150 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\nFinally it is important to remark that the coherent sum of the received signals\n\nis exploited by SAR tomography, and therefore the maximum effective baseline is\n\nalso limited by the necessity to keep phase coherence among the signals [46, 51, 52]\n\nB? \t lR0\n2 cos yDr\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhere Dr is the ground range resolution.\nWhen translating these requirements into the formation design framework, it\n\ncomes out that the basic requirement is the uniform sampling of the effective\n\nbaseline in a given interval, provided that this interval satisfies (3.29).\n\nFollowing the same line of reasoning of the previous section, different formation\n\ntypes can be exploited, such as multi-cartwheel, multi-pendulum, and multi-helix\n\nformations (and their combinations). Since at first order the effective baseline is a\n\nlinear function of dO (pendulum), de (cartwheel) or dO and de if dO/de is constant\n(helix), in all cases it can be uniformly sampled at all latitudes along the orbit by\n\nproperly scaling the differences in orbit parameters. Of course, as in the case of\n\ncross-track interferometry, the difference among the different formation types lies\n\nin the latitude coverage and the collision avoidance aspects.\n\nAs an example, let us assume X-band as operating frequency, radar range\n\nresolution of 5 m and off nadir angle of 30?, operating altitude of 600 km, chief\norbit inclination of 97.79? (sun-synchronous) and chief orbit eccentricity of 10?3.\nThen, from the tomography point of view, let us assume a vertical resolution of 5 m\n\nand a vertical dimension of 30 m. From (3.26) to (3.27), it comes out that an\n\neffective baseline of 2,400 m needs to be sampled in six intervals of 400 m, leading\n\nto the need for seven receiving apertures in a single pass scenario.\n\nIn the multi-pendulum case, assuming that the optimal observation geometry is\n\nrequired at the equator, from (3.6) it results\n\ndO \u00bc K DB?\na cos y sin i\n\nwith K \u00bc ?3;?2;?1; 1; 2; 3\u00bd ? (3.30)\n\nand in the case under analysis the second member equals K ? 0.0038?. Since the\nbaseline nullifies at the poles, tomographic reconstruction accuracy is lost at high\n\nlatitudes. In addition, proper along-track offsets have to be foreseen to minimize\n\ncollision risk. The effective baseline trend and the behavior of the out-of-plane\n\ncoordinate is shown in Fig. 3.13, assuming one of the receivers as the chief satellite\n\n(in the center of the formation) for 3 deputies only (due to the symmetry).\n\nLet us now consider a multi-cartwheel formation based on slight differences in\n\neccentricity. Again, on the basis of (3.6), the required differences in eccentricity can\n\nbe calculated as\n\nde \u00bc K DB?\na sin y\n\nwith K \u00bc ?3;?2;?1; 1; 2; 3\u00bd ? (3.31)\n\nand it results de \u00bc K ? 1.15 ? 10?4.\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 151\n\n\n\nThe effective baseline trend as a function of latitude depends on the argument of\n\nperigee. If the perigees are at 90?, the trend shown in Fig. 3.14 is obtained.\nIn the case of a multi-helix formation, it is possible to uniformly sample the\n\neffective baseline achieving a tomographic accuracy of the same order at all\n\nthe observable latitudes along the orbit. In fact, assuming as a first condition that\n\nthe ratio between the vertical and horizontal oscillations equals the tangent of the\n\nradar off-nadir angle y, dO and de can be calculated from the further condition\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nde2sin2y\u00fedO2sin2icos2y\n\np\n\u00bcKDB?\n\na\nwith K \u00bc ?3;?2;?1; 1; 2; 3\u00bd ? (3.32)\n\nand in the considered case it results K ? 5.7 ? 10?5.\nThe obtained trend of effective baseline resembles the one obtained with a multi-\n\ncartwheel with the perigees at 45?, while collision risk is minimized by the 90?\n\nphase difference between radial and cross-track oscillations (Figs. 3.15 and 3.16).\n\nIt is very interesting to consider the effect of perigee precession on geometry of\n\ntomographic observations. Again, the multi-pendulum geometry and latitude cover-\n\nage are not affected by perigee precession. In themulti-cartwheel case, the formation\n\ngeometry is not affected, rather the formation changes its latitude coverage although\n\nkeeping the capability to uniformly sample the same effective baseline interval,\n\nprovided that differential effects are counteracted by formation control. Instead, in\n\nthe multi-helix case, not only does the latitude coverage change, but the maximum\n\n\u201350 0 50\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nlatitude (\u00b0)\n\nef\nfe\n\nct\niv\n\ne \nba\n\nse\nlin\n\ne \n(m\n\n)\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\u20131500\n\n\u20131000\n\n\u2013500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\ntime (orbit fraction)\n\ncr\nos\n\ns-\ntr\n\nac\nk \n\nco\nor\n\ndi\nna\n\nte\n\ndeputy 1\n\ndeputy 2\ndeputy 3\n\nFig. 3.13 Effective baseline as a function of latitude, and cross-track coordinate along the orbit,\n\nfor a multi-pendulum formation (3 deputies)\n\n152 M.

These considerations are important if a hybrid repeat/single\n\npass scenario is considered in order to reduce the number of satellite platforms,\n\naccepting the drawback of temporal decorrelation. In this case, ground track repeat\n\ncycle can be synchronized with perigee precession in order to optimize the different\n\npassages of the formation, but eventual changes in formation geometry and baseline\n\nsampling have to be properly addressed. Furthermore, performance of absolute orbit\n\ncontrol becomes a key factor for ensuring sampling uniformity in the different\n\nformation passages.\n\n3.4.3 Large Baseline Synthetic Aperture Radar\n\nLarge baseline bistatic SAR data are gathered under relatively large angle differ-\n\nence to achieve uncorrelated information on radar cross section. This means that\n\nrelatively large differences in orbital parameters are required. However, if on the\n\none hand two satellites must be widely separated, on the other hand the passive\n\nreceiver must be capable of collecting the scattered radar signal. Thus, it must be\n\nlocated somewhere near the elevation plane of the transmitting radar. In addition, in\n\nmost cases a large satellite distance implies a large relative orbital motion with\n\n\u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0 20 40 60 80\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nlatitude (\u00b0)\n\nef\nfe\n\nct\niv\n\ne \nba\n\nse\nlin\n\ne \n(m\n\n)\ndeputy 1\ndeputy 2\ndeputy 3\n\nFig. 3.16 Effective baseline as a function of latitude for a multi-helix formation (3 deputies)\n\n154 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\nrespect to small relative displacement typical of interferometric configurations.\n\nTherefore, the need of adequate pointing to maintain the overlap between the two\n\nradar swaths along the orbit comes up as an additional peculiarity.\n\nAnother point to be considered is that large differences in orbital parameters can\n\ninduce different effects of orbit perturbations, thus requiring an unacceptable orbit\n\ncontrol effort. Following this line of reasoning, a large separation in along-track\n\ndirection, though easy to achieve imposing a difference in mean anomaly, is not\n\nadvantageous from the points of view of both SNR and attitude/pointing angles.\n\nIn addition, the required bistatic angle can be hardly obtained by a large vertical\n\nseparation because significant differential drag effect and along-track relative\n\nmotion are generated.\n\nThus, cross-track (horizontal) separation remains as the only possible solution,\n\nand the basic parameter to be exploited to achieve the required bistatic angle is a\n\ndifference in right ascension of the ascending node. The main drawback of this\n\nchoice is that the baseline will change along the orbit and nullify at orbit poles, thus\n\nloosing the bistatic geometry at high latitudes. On the other hand, since O does not\naffect J2 secular effects, large baselines can be obtained with no impact on forma-\n\ntion stability.\n\nIn practical terms, large baseline bistatic SAR can be achieved by a pendulum\n\nformation where dO depends on the maximum required bistatic angle, while as\nshown by D\u2019Errico and Moccia [53] the dM can be set imposing that at the equator\nthe receiver satellite lies in the elevation plane of the transmitter, which minimizes\n\nattitude/pointing requirements. In other terms, dM is used to compensate for the\nalong-track offset dOcosi (see 3.18) and the eventual yaw steering maneuver\nperformed by the transmitter.\n\nThis formation is J2 invariant and, if eccentricities and inclinations are properly\n\nchosen and the perigees are placed at 90?, the sun-synchronous frozen orbit\ncondition can be satisfied both for the transmitter and the receiver. However, the\n\ntwo orbits intersect at the poles and collision avoidance is based on the control of\n\nthe along-track offset.\n\nAs in helix formations, an additional (small) difference in eccentricity can be\n\nused to separate the orbits and introduce a residual vertical baseline at orbit poles. J2\ninvariancy is then lost, but the differential effects (see 3.12) are very small and can\n\nbe counteracted without a significant propellant expense.\n\nFor example, considering a transmitter satellite on a sun-synchronous circular\n\norbit at an altitude of 600 km, and imposing for the transmitter a constant off-nadir\n\nangle of 42? and for the receiver an off-nadir angle variable in the interval [5?, 23?],\nusing models in Ref. [53], one obtains for dO and dM the trends shown in Fig. 3.17.\nMoreover, a difference in eccentricity of the order of 1 ? 10?4 (with the perigee at\n90?) can be chosen to ensure a safety separation of about 1 km at the poles.\n\nSecond order equations (3.17), (3.18), and (3.19) can be used to understand\n\nthe relative trajectory. In particular, considering that, as shown in Fig. 3.17, the\n\ndifferences in right ascension of the ascending node and mean anomaly are of the\n\norder of 1?, and evaluating the order of magnitude of the different terms, at a first\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 155\n\n\n\nlevel of approximation it is possible to neglect most of the contributions thus\n\nobtaining:\n\nx\n\na\nffi? de cos MD0 \u00fe _MDt\n\n? ?? dO2\n2\n\n\u00fe dO\n2\n\n4\nsin2i\n\n? dO\n2\n\n4\nsin2i cos oD0 \u00feMD0 \u00fe u0 \u00fe 2 _uDt\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(3.33)\n\ny\n\na\nffi 2de sin MD0 \u00fe _MDt\n\n? ?\u00fe du0 \u00fe dO cos i\n\u00fe dO\n\n2\n\n4\nsin2i ? sin oD0 \u00feMD0 \u00fe u0 \u00fe 2 _uDt\u00f0 \u00de\n\n(3.34)\n\nz\n\na\nffi ?dO sin i cos oD0 \u00feMD0 \u00fe _uDt\u00f0 \u00de (3.35)\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\nRx Satellite Off-nadir angle (\u00b0)\n\n(\u00b0\n)\n\n?M\n??\n\n \n\nFig. 3.17 Differences in mean anomaly and right ascension of the ascending node in a large\n\nbaseline bistatic SAR formation, as a function of the off-nadir angle of the receiver\n\n156 M. D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\nEquation 3.33, in particular, clearly shows that the effect of the difference in\n\neccentricity is to avoid nullification of radial separation at the orbit poles.\n\nThe cross-track coordinate oscillates at orbital frequency as in the interferometric\n\ncase, while the main terms contributing to the in-plane coordinates are at a frequency\n\nthat is twice the orbital one. Offsets are generated both for the radial and the along-\n\ntrack coordinate, the former depending on dO, the latter on the yaw steering attitude\nmaneuver. The resulting 3d relative trajectory, and the projections on the coordinate\n\nplanes, are shown in Fig. 3.18 (different scales along the axes) which is obtained in\n\nthe example described above (Fig. 3.17) by selecting an off-nadir angle of 23? for the\nreceiver (dO \u00bc 2.77?, dM \u00bc 0.56?, de \u00bc 1.4 ? 10?4). The combination of\noscillations at different frequencies produces motion patterns which differ from\n\nthe case of close formations such as the ones used for SAR interferometry. This\n\nformation geometry produces a stable large baseline bistatic SAR formation, which\n\nallows generating constant trends of bistatic angle as a function of latitude.\n\nIt is also interesting to investigate \u201cdynamic\u201d large baseline formations, where\n\nrelative trajectory is modified in a controlled way to obtain SAR acquisitions with\n\nvarying bistatic angle. As shown in Refs. [54, 55], the basic concept to ensure\n\nmission feasibility it to exploit differential J2 effects to the mission advantage. On\n\nthe grounds of (3.12), a differential nodal drift can be activated by imposing a\n\ndifference in inclination. This will also cause an in-plane drift which in general\n\n15\n20\n\n25\n30\n\n35\n40\n\n\u2013500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\u201320\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201310\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nalong track (km)cross track (km)\n\nra\ndi\n\nal\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\nFig. 3.18 3d relative trajectory and projections for a large baseline bistatic SAR formation\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 157\n\n\n\ndiffers from the one required for minimization of attitude/pointing requirements.\n\nTo counteract this drawback, two solutions can be envisaged. The first one consists\n\nin applying periodical in-plane corrections to keep the optimal along-track separa-\n\ntion. Whereas, the second one builds on an ad-hoc da. In fact, considering the order\nof magnitude of the coefficients in (3.12), it comes out that due to the high\n\nsensitivity of the along-track drift on the difference of semi-major axis, along-\n\ntrack motion can be finely tuned by a very small da (of the order of a few meters)\nwhich has no significant impact on the geometry of relative trajectory. Therefore,\n\napart from the manoeuvre necessary to establish the required da, no additional\npropellant expense are foreseen for along-track relative displacement control.\n\nFinally, if the arguments of perigees equal 90? in nominal conditions, a differ-\nence in eccentricity can be again used to generate a safety separation at the orbit\n\npoles. What is obtained is a drifting bistatic formation that exploits differential J2\neffects to modify the observation geometry in a controlled way.\n\nRequired differences in orbital parameters can be calculated by straightforward\n\nanalytical relations if differential J2 effects are linearized as in (3.11), (3.12), and\n\n(3.13).\n\nIn fact, assuming a required nodal drift dO\n:\n\nreq, the optimal in-plane drift can be\n\ncalculated as [54]\n\ndu\n:\nreq ffi KreqdO\n\n:\n\nreq (3.36)\n\nwhere Kreq is a coefficient of order 1.\nNeglecting J2 dependancy on eccentricity, differences in inclination and semi-\n\nmajor axes can be calculated by solving the linear system\n\ndO\n:\n\nreq \u00bc CO;a daa \u00fe CO;idi\ndu\n:\nreq \u00bc Cu;a daa \u00fe Cu;idi\n\n(\n(3.37)\n\nIndeed, given the order of magnitude of the coefficients (see Sect. 3.2.1), it\n\ncomes out that daa ffi O 10?3di\n? ?\n\n, and equations\u2019 solution can be approximated as\n\nfollows:\n\ndi ffi dO\n:\n\nreq\n\nCO;i\n\nda\na\n\n\u00bc du\n:\nreq ?

D\u2019Errico and G. Fasano\n\n\n\n3.5 Conclusion\n\nSimple but effective relative motion model is a strong need of formation design.\n\nIn the last decade, relative motion models have been strongly improved with respect\n\nto the initial Hill\u2019s schematization in two main fields: inclusion of orbit eccentricity\n\nand J2 effects. This worldwide research effort has in fact produced a number of\n\nrelative models which, relying on linearized orbital parameter differences, bear\n\nmany similarities in their final forms. They now allow producing more effective\n\ndesign particularly for close (separation of a few kilometers) formations and small\n\neccentricities. Large formations (separations till a few hundreds of kilometers)\n\nrequire additional, quadratic terms to be included, which would lead to a complex\n\nfully general model with application difficulties. Indeed, models have been devel-\n\noped for some special cases. Relative motion models have also been developed for\n\nlarge eccentricities of the chief\u2019s orbit, although their effective application to\n\nformation design is questionable due to their complexity and the inherent\n\ndifficulties to derive design parameters from requirements.\n\nIt has also been shown how relative motion models can capture the different\n\ndynamic effects and it is possible to directly establish a cause/effect relation\n\nbetween relative trajectory components and orbital parameters for a number of\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20132\n\n0\n\n2\nra\n\ndi\nal\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n\u201310\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nal\non\n\ng-\ntr\n\nac\nk \n\n(k\nm\n\n)\n\n\u2013200\n\n0\n\n200\n\ncr\nos\n\ns \ntr\n\nac\nk \n\n(k\nm\n\n)\n\n1st 400th 800th\n\norbits (nodal period)\n\n1200th 1600th 2000th\n\nFig. 3.19 Example of relative motion components for a slowly drifting bistatic formation\n\n(Reproduced with kind permission from Springer Science+Business Media B.V.# 2010 Springer\nPublished in Ref. [55])\n\n3 Relative Trajectory Design 159\n\n\n\neffects: offset, oscillation at orbital frequency, oscillation at multiple of the orbital\n\nfrequency, etc. This possibility has a positive outcome on formation design, as it\n\nwas pointed out in previous pages. In particular, it was shown that one can derive\n\ndesired trajectory features from requirements in the case of SAR interferometry and\n\nthen utilize relative motion model to determine the needed differences in the orbital\n\nparameters, selecting the most appropriate relative trajectory shape. Such approach\n\nwas also satisfactory for SAR tomography. In addition, inclusion of some quadratic\n\nterms proved to be effective to design large formations for bistatic SAR\n\napplications.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Alfriend\n\nAbstract This chapter presents continuous and impulsive control methods for\n\nformation initialization, maintenance, and reconfiguration. For two-body, circular\n\nreference orbits, elementary impulsive control schemes are developed based on the\n\navailable state transition matrix for relative motion. Formation propagation and\n\ncontrol models are presented in the space of differential orbital elements and\n\nCartesian/curvilinear coordinate systems. The J2-perturbation effects are conve-\nniently modeled with the mean elements and their secular drift rates. Methods for\n\naccommodating the disturbance due to the J2 by modification of the relative orbit\ninitial conditions are discussed. Examples provided include multi-impulse optimal\n\nformation initializationmaneuvers and a novel inter-satellite fuel balancing concept.\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nNeighboring spacecraft in unperturbed two-body orbits of equal periods remain in\n\nclosed relative trajectories, constituting a formation. Formations with small separa-\n\ntion distances can be described by the periodic solutions of the Clohessey-Wiltshire\n\n(CW) [4] and Tschauner-Hempel (TH) [10, 19] equations, for circular and elliptic\n\nreference orbits, respectively. These classic solutions form the basis for the design\n\nof formations and methods for their control, which have to be modified to account\n\nfor the unmodeled effects of geometric nonlinearities and perturbations.\n\nPersistent disturbances must be accommodated and cannot be countered with\n\ncontrol action. Hence, the formation geometry must confirm to natural solutions\n\nS.R. Vadali (*) \u2022 K.T.

This chapter presents a descrip-\n\ntion of the geometry of satellite formations and the initial conditions required\n\nto establish them. In particular, the mean orbital element differences required to\n\naccommodate the J2-perturbation are provided, along with a brief discussion of\nmethods for continuous and impulsive control for formation establishment, main-\n\ntenance, and reconfiguration.\n\n4.2 Formation Geometry for Circular Orbits\n\nRelative motion of a satellite (deputy) in the small, with respect to a circular\n\nreference orbit (of a chief, either real or virtual), with mean motion n, is described\nby the CW equations:\n\n\u20acx? 2n _y? 3n2x \u00bc 0 (4.1)\n\n\u20acy\u00fe 2n _x \u00bc 0 (4.2)\n\n\u20acz\u00fe n2z \u00bc 0 (4.3)\n\nwhere x, y, and z represent, respectively, the radial, along-track, and cross-track\nseparations. The matrix representation of the solution to the CW equations can be\n\nexpressed as\n\nx\u00f0y\u00de \u00bc F\u00f0y\u00de x\u00f00\u00de (4.4)\n\nwhere the state vector is x \u00bc x; y; z; _x; _y; _z\u00bd ?T and the state transition matrix (STM) is\n\nF \u00bc\n\n4? 3 cos y 0 0 sin y\nn\n\n2\u00f01? cos y\u00de\nn\n\n0\n\n?6\u00f0 y? sin y\u00de 1 0 ?2\u00f01? cos y\u00de\nn\n\n4 sin y? 3 y\nn\n\n0\n\n0 0 cos y 0 0\nsin y\nn\n\n3 n sin y 0 0 cos y 2 sin y 0\n\n?6n \u00f01? cos y\u00de 0 0 ?2 sin y ?3\u00fe 4 cos y 0\n\n0 0 ?n sin y 0 0 cos y\n\n2\n66666666666666666666666666664\n\n3\n77777777777777777777777777775\n\n(4.5)\n\n164 S.R. Vadali and K.T. Alfriend\n\n\n\nThe variable y \u00bc nt is an orbit reference angle or equivalently, the nondimensional\ntime. Secular terms present in the STM can be eliminated by selecting initial\n\nconditions satisfying\n\n_y\u00f00\u00de \u00bc ?2nx\u00f00\u00de (4.6)\n\nWith the application of Eq. (4.6), the periodic solutions of the CW equations can be\n\nrepresented by\n\nx \u00bc rx sin\u00f0y\u00fe ax\u00de (4.7)\n\ny \u00bc ry \u00fe 2rx cos\u00f0y\u00fe ax\u00de (4.8)\n\nz \u00bc rz sin\u00f0y\u00fe az\u00de (4.9)\n\nwhere rx and rz are amplitudes of motion along the respective directions and\nax and az are the corresponding phase angles. The parameter ry determines the\nalong-track bias or the mean standoff distance. Relative trajectories can be shaped\n\nand oriented by choosing appropriate amplitudes and phase angles. For the special\n\ncase of ax \u00bc az, the radial and cross-track separations are in phase, i.e., they cross\nzero at the same time. On the other hand, if ax \u00bc az ? p2 , radial and cross-track\nseparations are maximally out of phase; one is at its extremum when the other is\n\nzero. The out-of-phase option is preferable for collision avoidance, in the presence\n\nof along-track drift or uncertainty in the parameter ry.\nThe Projected Circular Orbit (PCO) in the y-z plane is obtained by selecting\n\nax \u00bc az; ry \u00bc 0; rz \u00bc 2rx (4.10)\n\nSimilarly, the following choice of parameters\n\nax \u00bc p\n2\n\u00fe az; ry \u00bc 0; rz \u00bc rx (4.11)\n\nresults in the x-z PCO. The x-y-ellipse formation is the result of settingry \u00bc rz \u00bc 0.\nAlthough Eqs. (4.7)\u2013(4.9) are valid only under the ideal assumptions behind the\n\nCW model, they provide a preliminary design for the formation, which can be\n\nmodified to accommodate perturbations. The CW STM also proves useful for\n\nformation control under impulsive thrust applications.\n\n4.3 Formation Establishment by Impulsive Control\n\nBased on CW Equations\n\nMultiple satellites launched from a common launch vehicle are often inserted into\n\nthe same orbit, with some degree of separation along the reference orbit, resulting in\n\nan in-line or leader-follower formation. The separation distances or phase angles\n\nbetween satellites can be altered by phasing maneuvers to initialize or establish a\n\n4 Formation Establishment, Maintenance, and Control 165\n\n\n\nformation. This section treats elementary formation establishment problems based\n\non the CW STM and impulsive thrusting, with the number of impulses and their\n\napplication times selected a priori.\n\n4.3.1 Initialization of In-plane Elliptic Formations\n\nSatellites in an in-line formation can be initialized into the x-y ellipse by a variety of\nmaneuvers, involving radial and tangential impulses. It is assumed that the in-line\n\nstate vector of the CW equations is x(0) \u00bc [0, y(0), 0, 0, 0, 0]T. The cross-track\ncomponents of the state vector are ignored for the planar examples considered.\n\n4.3.1.1 Single Radial Impulse\n\nApplication of the selected initial conditions to Eqs. (4.4)\u2013(4.6) shows that the\n\nrequirement for achieving the desired formation with a single radial impulse is\n\n0\n\ny\u00f00\u00de\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775\u00fe\n\nsin y\nn\n\n?2\u00f01? cos y\u00de\nn\n\ncos y\n?2 sin y\n\n2\n6666664\n\n3\n7777775Dv \u00bc rx\n\nsin\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\n2 cos\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\nn cos\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\n\n?2n sin\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775 (4.12)\n\nEquation (4.12) is satisfied for ax \u00bc 0, Dv \u00bc nrx, and y(0) \u00bc 2rx. Hence, the\nsatellite achieves the x-y ellipse formation initial conditions immediately after\nthe application of the impulse, but with the restriction that the semimajor axis of\n\nthe ellipse be equal to y(0). Depending on the thrust limit, the required impulse may\nnot be realizable with a single burn if y(0) is large; multiple burns of smaller\ndurations may have to be considered.\n\n4.3.1.2 Two Tangential Impulses\n\nIt is impossible to achieve the desired initialization with a single tangential impulse.\n\nThe constraint resulting from the application of two tangential impulses, the first at\n\nthe initial point and the second, after a reference orbit angle of y, is\n\n0\n\ny\u00f00\u00de\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775\u00fe\n\n2\u00f01? cos y\u00de\nn\n\n4 sin y? 3y\nn\n\n2 sin y\n\n?3\u00fe 4 cos y\n\n2\n6666664\n\n3\n7777775Dv1 \u00fe\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDv2\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00bc rx\n\nsin\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\n2 cos\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\nn cos\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\n\n?2n sin\u00f0ax \u00fe y\u00de\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775 (4.13)\n\n166 S.R. Vadali and K.T. Alfriend\n\n\n\nThe set of parameters satisfying Eq.

[11]. A brief discussion of optimal maneuvers is presented in\n\nSect. 4.9.\n\n4.4 Description of Formations with Differential\n\nOrbital Elements\n\nThe classical orbital elements are\n\n\u2022 a, semimajor axis\n\u2022 e, eccentricity\n\u2022 i, inclination\n\u2022 O, right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN)\n\u2022 o, argument of perigee\n\u2022 M, mean anomaly\n\nIn the following the argument of latitude is defined as y \u00bc o\u00fe f . For near-circular\norbits, it is convenient to replace e, o, and M with the nonsingular elements\nq1 \u00bc ecoso, q2 \u00bc esino, and the mean argument of latitude, l \u00bc o\u00feM.\n\nIt has been shown [5, 7, 20] that in a curvilinear coordinate representation, the\n\nrelative motion variables can be expressed in terms of the differential orbital\n\nelements as\n\nx \u00bc dr (4.20)\n\ny \u00bc r0\u00f0dy\u00fe dO cos i0\u00de (4.21)\n\nz \u00bc r0\u00f0? sin i0dO cos y0 \u00fe di sin y0\u00de (4.22)\n\nwhere d indicates a differential and (?)0 refers to variables pertaining to the\nreference orbit, e.g., r0 is the radius of the chief. In the curvilinear coordinate\nsystem, radial separation is the difference between the radii of the two satellites; y is\nthe arc length from the chief to the radius vector of the deputy along an imaginary\n\ncircular orbit of radius r0 in the plane of the chief\u2019s orbit, and similarly, z is the\ncross-track arc length to the radius vector of the deputy. Linearization in the\n\ncurvilinear coordinate system captures some of the nonlinear effects neglected by\n\nthe CW model.\n\nRelationships between the differential elements and the CW parameters are\n\nobtained by comparing Eqs. (4.21) and (4.22) with Eqs. (4.8) and (4.9):\n\ndi \u00bc rz\na0\n\ncos az (4.23)\n\n168 S.R. Vadali and K.T.

The mean elements can be obtained from the\n\nosculating elements by means of a canonical transformation [3]. Under the effect of\n\nJ2, the mean a, e, and i remain constant and the mean O, o, and M vary linearly.\nThe secular rates of the angles are\n\n_M \u00bc n 1?

Note that the\n\nangular rates depend on the three parameters a, e, and i.\nSatellites in a formation will drift apart if their respective angular rates do not\n\nmatch. In general, it is impossible to simultaneously null the three primary differ-\n\nential angular rates: d _M, d _o, and d _O, by selecting the three parameters da, de, and di\n[1, 14]. The condition for eliminating cross-track drift is d _O \u00bc 0 and that for along-\ntrack drift is d _l\u00fe d _O cos i \u00bc 0 [22]. The condition for eliminating along-track drift\ncan be reduced to a condition on da [1]:\n\nda \u00bc ?0:5J2a0 Re\na0\n\n? ?2\n3?0 \u00fe 4\n\n?40\n\n? ?\n\n? 1? 3 cos2i0\n? ? q10dq1 \u00fe q20dq2\n\n?20\n\u00fe sin 2i0di\n\n? ?\n(4.35)\n\nEquations (4.23)\u2013(4.27) and (4.35) are essential for initializing relative orbits.\n\nAs an example, consider the initialization of y-z PCOs with the following mean\nelements of the chief:\n\na0 \u00bc 7;092 km; e0 \u00bc 0; i0 \u00bc 70?\n\nO0 \u00bc 45?; o0 \u00bc 0?; M0 \u00bc 0?\n(4.36)\n\nRelative orbits with rz \u00bc 1 km are shown in Fig. 4.1, for several a (\u00bc ax \u00bc az)\nvalues and for 50 orbits of the chief.

Vadali and K.T. Alfriend\n\n\n\neach case, cross-track drift is not. Moreover, the relative orbits precess due to non-\n\ncommensurate in-plane and out-of-plane frequencies, with the precession rate\n\ndepending on a.\nAs shown in Ref. [24], the in-plane frequency of relative motion is _M0 and the\n\ncross-track frequency is given by\n\nnz ? _M0 \u00fe _o0 ? sin i0d\n_Odi\n\ndi2 \u00fe \u00f0sin i0dO\u00f00\u00de\u00de2\n(4.37)\n\nBesides the perigee rotation rate, the cross-track frequency depends also on the\n\ndifferential nodal precession rate. It is interesting to note thataz also gets affected by\nJ2 and is given by\n\n_az \u00bc ? sin i0d\n_Odi\n\ndi2 \u00fe \u00f0sin i0dO\u00de2\n(4.38)\n\nA matching condition relating the orbit inclination and the initial phase angle for\n\nformations in near-circular orbits is [13, 24]\n\ni0\u00bc sin?1\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n4\n\n5\u00fe 2 cos2az\u00f00\u00de\n\ns !\n(4.39)\n\nEquation (4.39) is valid only over the short-term, since certain assumptions to this\n\neffect have been made in its derivation. Foraz(0) \u00bc 90? and 270?, the results are the\ntwo critical inclinations, i0 \u00bc 63. 43? and 116. 57?, respectively. For az(0) \u00bc 0 and\n180?, the inclination values are, respectively, i0 \u00bc 49. 11? and 130. 89?. Four\nfrequency-matched y-z PCOs satisfying Eq. (4.39) are shown in Fig. 4.2 for differ-\nent inclinations. Since a frequency-matched relative orbit adheres to the classical\n\nCW solution reasonably well, it requires relatively small control effort to counter\n\nthe precession due to J2.\n\n4.6 Formation Maintenance by Continuous Control\n\nThe problem of formation maintenance with continuous control is formulated in\n\nthis section. The CW equations have been modified in [23, 24] to account for the\n\nJ2-induced disturbance as\n\n\u20acx? 2 _M0 _y? 3 _M20x \u00bc ?3n20da\u00fe uxc (4.40)\n\n\u20acy\u00fe 2 _M0 _x \u00bc uyc (4.41)\n\n\u20acz\u00fe _M20z \u00bc ?2n0 _o0z? 2rz\u00f00\u00dekn0 sin i20 sin l0 cos az\u00f00\u00de \u00fe uzc (4.42)\n\n4 Formation Establishment, Maintenance, and Control 171\n\n\n\nwhere\n\nk \u00bc ?1:5J2 Re\na0\n\n? ?2\nn0 (4.43)\n\nand uxc , uyc , and uzc are the control accelerations along their respective axes.\nThese equations resemble the CW equations somewhat, if n is replaced by _M0 .\nThe forcing terms present in the radial and cross-track directions are functions ofda,\nrz(0), and az(0). This model, albeit approximate, accounts for the differential nodal\nprecession caused by a differential inclination. Equation (4.38) shows that az is\ntime-varying in the presence of J2 and indeed, so is rz.\n\nFigure 4.3a shows a snapshot of an ideal eight-satellite y-z PCO formation when\nthe chief is at the ascending node of its own orbit. Satellites 1 and 5 have the\n\nmaximum di and dO \u00bc 0, whereas satellites 3 and 7 have the maximum dO and\ndi \u00bc 0. For near-circular orbits, the fuel required to negate differential J2 effects is\ndominated by di. Hence, satellites 1 and 5 will require more fuel than the pair 3\nand 7. A formation maintenance approach, motivated by the flight patterns of\n\nmigratory birds, is to command a slow time variation in the phase angle of each\n\nsatellite, given by a \u00bc a\u00f00\u00de \u00fe _at , where _an0 is O\u00f0J2\u00de . As a result, the formation\nappears to regress at a subsequent ascending nodal crossing of the chief, as shown\n\nby the small white circles in Fig. 4.3b.\n\n?2 0 2\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAlong?Track (km)\n\nO\nut\n\n?\nof\n\n?\nP\n\nla\nne\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\ni=50\u00b0\n\n?2 0 2\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAlong?Track (km)\n\nO\nut\n\n?\nof\n\n?\nP\n\nla\nne\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\ni=55\u00b0\n\n?2 0 2\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAlong?Track (km)\n\nO\nut\n\n?\nof\n\n?\nP\n\nla\nne\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\ni=60\u00b0\n\n?2 0 2\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAlong?Track (km)\n\nO\nut\n\n?\nof\n\n?\nP\n\nla\nne\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\ni=63.4\u00b0\n\nFig. 4.2 Frequency matched relative orbits for various inclinations\n\n172 S.R.

In the discussion following, it is assumed that radial thrust, which has\n\nbeen proven to be inefficient for this application [24], is inhibited.

The feed-\n\nback controls for the y and z axes are augmented with the feedforward controls\ngiven by Eqs. (4.49) and (4.50):\n\nuy\nuz\n\n? ?\n\u00bc uyc\n\nuzc\n\n? ?\n?K x? xr\n\n_x? _xr\n\n? ?\n(4.53)\n\nwhere, K is the LQR gain matrix and x \u00bc x y z\t \nT. The reference position vector\nxr is obtained from Eqs. (4.46)\u2013(4.48).\n\nBeginning with a set of mean elements for the chief, the initial mean elements\n\nfor the deputies are setup as per Eqs. (4.23)\u2013(4.27) and (4.35). The mean\n\nelements of the satellites are converted into the respective osculating elements via\n\nthe procedure given in [7]. The osculating orbital elements can be converted into\n\ninertial position and velocity vectors to obtain the initial conditions required for a\n\nnumerical integration process. The relative position and velocity states are obtained\n\nfrom the inertial states of the satellites by using the transformations presented in\n\nRef. [21]. Next, the relative position and velocity states are filtered [17] to remove\n\nthe short-periodic oscillations and then feedback via the control law given by\n\nEq. (4.53).\n\nA formation of seven satellites in a 1 km, PCO configuration with initial\n\nphase angles ranging from 0? to 90? is considered in Ref. [24]. The chief is\n\nassumed to be in a circular orbit with a0 \u00bc 7,100km and i0 \u00bc 49.11?. For this example,\n_aopt \u00bc ?2:07?=day . The control weight matrix is diagonal, with entries [1, 1]/n04;\n\n174 S.R. Vadali and K.T. Alfriend\n\n\n\nthe stateweightmatrix is also diagonalwith unitweights for the position coordinates and\n\nn0\n?2 for the rate errors.\nFigure 4.4 shows the cost of formation maintenance using a mean-element based\n\nfeedback controller, with and without fuel-balancing, obtained by evaluating\n\nEq. (4.44) for each satellite. The balanced cost curves are close to each other and\n\nhave a smaller average slope compared to the unbalanced cost curves. The total\n\nformation maintenance cost with fuel balancing is 8.49?10?5 m2/s3/year, compared\nto 1.59 ?10 ? 4 m2/s3/year obtained by holding a(0) constant for each satellite.\n\nAn alternative virtual center approach [18] for formation maintenance with fuel\nbalancing is to exert control on each satellite in proportion to its fuel content\n\nwith respect to the formation average. The satellite with the least fuel is designated\n\nthe uncontrolled chief, with respect to which the remaining satellites are\n\ncommanded to maintain formation. A method for controlling formations by\n\nestablishing the required differential mean elements via a control Lyapunov func-\n\ntion approach is presented in Ref. [16].\n\n4.7 Gauss\u2019 Variational Equations Including Mean J2 Effects\n\nGauss\u2019 variational equations (GVE) provide a convenient model for computing\n\nsolutions to multi-impulse orbit correction problems.

Control problems involving mean circular orbits can be\nformulated with Eqs. (4.58) and (4.60).\n\n4.8 Gim-Alfriend State Transition Matrix\n\nThe Gim-Alfriend State transition matrix (GA STM) propagates the relative states\n\n(position and velocity vectors) under the influence of J2. Included in this method is\na conversion between the mean and osculating differential orbital elements. The\n\ncurvilinear state vector, x \u00bc x; _x; y; _y; z; _z\u00bd ?T is propagated as\nx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc S\u00f0t\u00def\u00f0t; t0\u00deS?1\u00f0t0\u00de x\u00f0t0\u00de (4.61)\n\nwhere S(t) is the transformation matrix relating the instantaneous osculating,\nnonsingular differential orbital element vector d\u0153(t) and f(t, t0) is the STM for\nthe relative mean elements. The nonsingular orbital element vector is defined as\n\n\u0153 \u00bc [a,y, i, q1, q2, O]T. The elements ofS(t) andf(t, t0) have been derived in [1, 7].\nThe GA STM is an analytical propagation method and hence, is faster than\n\nnumerical integration procedures. Generally, it is more accurate than the mean-\n\nJ2-augmented-GVE approach. Of course, the most accurate method for relative\nmotion prediction is to difference the results of numerical integration of the\n\nequations of motion of the individual satellites.\n\n4.9 Fuel-Optimal Control\n\nIn this section an impulsive thrust approximation is used for fuel-optimal formation\n\ncontrol. If each impulse vector is produced by a single thruster which can be pointed\n\nin the desired direction, by attitude control of the satellite, then the appropriate\n\nperformance index is\n\nj1 \u00bc\nXN\nj\u00bc1\n\nkDvjk \u00bc\nXN\nj\u00bc1\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nDv2xj \u00fe Dv2yj \u00fe Dv2zj\n\nq\n(4.62)\n\n178 S.R. Vadali and K.T. Alfriend\n\n\n\nwhere N is the number of impulses. Alternatively, if the scalar components of an\nimpulse vector are independently produced, the appropriate cost function is\n\nj2 \u00bc\nXN\nj\u00bc1\n\nDvxj\n\n\n \n\n\u00fe Dvyj\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00fe Dvzj\n\n \n\n (4.63)\n\nThe problem of minimization of Eq. (4.63) can be simplified if each impulse is\n\nrepresented as follows [9]:\n\nDv \u00bc Dv\u00fe ? Dv? (4.64)\n\nwith Dv + and Dv ? limited by\n\n0 \t Dv\u00fe \t Dvmax (4.65a)\n\n0 \t Dv? \t Dvmax (4.65b)\n\nwhere Dvmax is the maximum impulse magnitude. With the above representation,\nthe performance index can be written as\n\nj2 \u00bc\nXN\nj\u00bc1\n\n\u00f0Dv\u00fexj \u00fe Dv?xj \u00fe Dv\u00feyj \u00fe Dv?yj \u00fe Dv\u00fezj \u00fe Dv?zj \u00de (4.66)\n\nwith the understanding that the solution for each impulse will be characterized by\n\neither Dv \u00fe or Dv ? being zero.\nThe impulse application times and the Dv magnitude/directions become the free\n\nparameters for optimization. For example, the computation of a two-impulse\n\nmaneuver requires the determination of six impulse components (three per\n\nimpulse), the two impulse application times, and a final coast interval, leading to\n\nnine parameters. Although the number of impulses required for an optimal transfer\n\nis unknown a priori, two to four impulses are adequate for most orbit establishment\n\nmaneuvers. Collision avoidance between satellites and compensation for thrust\n\nimplementation errors are important factors, not considered in this chapter.\n\n4.9.1 Formation Establishment and Reconfiguration\n\nIn this section, an example of a formation establishment/reconfiguration problem is\n\npresented. The fuel-optimal control problem is formulated with j2 as the perfor-\nmance measure. The simulation model is based on numerical integration of the\n\nJ2-perturbed equations of motion of the satellites in the Earth Centered Inertial\n(ECI) frame. Relative motion variables are transformed into the chief-centered\n\n4 Formation Establishment, Maintenance, and Control 179\n\n\n\nrotating frame for visualization, the process for which is given in Ref. [1]. The chief\n\nis assumed to be uncontrolled, with initial classical mean elements\n\noe0 \u00bc \u00bd7;100 km :05 60? 00 0?T (4.67)\n\nThe deputy is assumed to be in the chief\u2019s orbit, but with a separation distance of\n\n1 km. Hence, all the differential mean elements are zero, except for dM \u00bc ry=a0,\nwith ry \u00bc 1 km. The deputy is to be initialized into a y-z PCO with r \u00bc 2 km and\na \u00bc 0, for which the constraints are given by Eqs. (4.27) and (4.35). The optimal\nsolutions for the impulse magnitudes and the application times (tj) obtained from\nthe software package SNOPT [6] are presented in Table 4.1. The four-impulse\n\nproblem has been solved without radial thrust, resulting in a reduction of 50% in the\n\nin-plane thrust.\n\nThe two-impulse maneuver is primarily executed by radial and cross-track\n\nimpulses, along-track impulses being negligible. The impulses are separated by a\n\nhalf orbital period. The solution to this problem is non-unique. A similar example,\n\nwith the use of Eq. (4.54), is provided in Ref. [1]. There are slight differences in\n\nthe two results due to the model used for orbit propagation. Figure 4.5 provides\n\ntwo views of the relative trajectory of the deputy, identifying the locations of\n\nTable 4.1 Formation establishment results\n\nImp\n\nRadial\n\n(m/s)\n\nAlong-track\n\n(m/s)\n\nCross-track\n\n(m/s)\n\nj2\n(m/s)\n\ntj\n(orbits)\n\n2\n0:812\n?0:243\n? ?\n\n0\n\n?0:002\n? ?\n\n0\n\n?2:007\n? ?\n\n3.065\n0\n\n:5\n\n? ?\n\n4 0\n\n?0:072\n0\n\n0:263\n?0:193\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775\n\n0\n\n?2:007\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 2.535\n\n0:238\n0:5\n\n0:762\n1:239\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775\n\n?2 ?1.5 ?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nalong?track (km)\n\nra\ndi\n\nal\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\n12\n\n?2 ?1 0 1 2\n\n?1.5\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nalong?track (km)\n\na b\n\ncr\nos\n\ns?\ntr\n\nac\nk \n\n(k\nm\n\n)\n\n1\n2\n\nFig. 4.5 Establishment of a y-z PCO with a \u00bc a(0) starting from an in-line formation by a\ntwo-impulse maneuver\n\n180 S.R. Vadali and K.T. Alfriend\n\n\n\nthe impulses. Figure 4.5a shows that the minimum separation distance during\n\nthe course of the two-impulse maneuver is ?0.7km in the radial direction. Fig-\nure 4.6 shows that the four-impulse maneuver maintains a higher clearance between\n\nthe two satellites.\n\nFormation reconfiguration is a special case of initialization. An example of a\n\ntwo-impulse PCO reconfiguration problem, based on the analytical solution to\n\nEqs. (4.60), is presented in Ref. [26]. In general, J2 does not significantly alter\nthe results for maneuvers performed over the course of one or two orbits. The\n\nimpulse magnitudes and maneuver times can be well estimated by two-body\n\nmodels. However, even the implementation of the impulse data obtained from\n\none J2-model into another equivalent simulation model can produce unacceptable\nresults. Hence, it cannot be overemphasized that in practice, maneuvers in close\n\nproximity to other satellites require careful planning and accurate execution.\n\nChaps. 11 and 12 of Ref. [1] and [8, 12] deal with the practical realities of dealing\n\nwith off-nominal thruster performance and navigation errors.\n\n4.9.2 Formation Maintenance\n\nLong-term formation maintenance and inter-satellite fuel balancing is a challenging\n\nproblem, especially with impulsive control. For mean circular orbits, a two-\n\nimpulse-per-orbit scheme based on Eqs. (4.60) has been developed in Ref. [25].\n\nImpulse magnitudes and their application times are obtained analytically by\n\ndecoupling in-plane and cross-track dynamics. Results are presented for the fol-\n\nlowing choices of the mean nonsingular elements of the chief:\n\na0 \u00bc 7;092 km; y0 \u00bc 0 rad; i0 \u00bc 70?\nq10 \u00bc 0; q20 \u00bc 0; O0 \u00bc 45?\n\n(4.68)\n\n?1.5 ?1 ?0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n?1.5\n\n?1\n\n?0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nalong?track (km)\n\na b\nra\n\ndi\nal\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n?2 ?1 0 1 2\n\n?1.5\n?1\n\n?0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nalong?track (km)\n\ncr\nos\n\ns?\ntr\n\nac\nk \n\n(k\nm\n\n)\n\n1, 2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nFig. 4.6 Establishment of a y-z PCO with a \u00bc a(0) starting from an in-line formation by a\nfour-impulse maneuver\n\n4 Formation Establishment, Maintenance, and Control 181\n\n\n\nA reference y-z PCO given by Eqs. (4.7)\u2013(4.9) is selected with r \u00bc 1 km.\nWithout fuel balancing, the maximum cross-track and in-plane impulse\n\nrequirements are 41 m/s/year and 6 m/s/year, respectively. Since the cross-track\n\ncontrol component dominates in this example, it is used to determine _a for fuel\nbalancing. For a y-z PCO, with a uniform distribution of a(0) values and\ncorresponding to the selected mean elements of the chief, _a ? ?2:723?=day .\nIn-plane and out-of-plane impulse components are combined into a single impulse,\n\neach of which is applied at an interval of half the orbital period. The performance\n\nmeasure j1 is applicable to this problem.\nFigure 4.7 shows the impulses for the satellite with a(0) \u00bc 0. The average cost\n\nper satellite with fuel balancing is 25.8 m/s/year, close to the average of the\n\nmaximum cross-track and in-plane control costs. The error in the radius of PCO\n\nformation is shown in Fig. 4.8. The maximum error in the radius of the PCO due to\n\nthe effect of J2 is approximately 3 m. As shown in Ref. [25], the error bound\nincreases to 40 m if the impulses are applied during every tenth orbit of the chief.\n\n4.10 Conclusions\n\nThis chapter presents a geometric description of formations in circular and elliptic\n\norbits using Cartesian/curvilinear coordinates and differential orbital elements.\n\nThe initial conditions for unperturbed formations are modified to accommodate\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\nx 10?3\n\n?V\nx \n\n(m\n/s\n\n)\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\nx 10?3\n\n?V\ny \n\n(m\n/s\n\n)\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\nx 10?3\n\nOrbits\n\n?V\nz \n\n(m\n/s\n\n)\n\nFig. 4.7 Impulse components for formation maintenance, a(0) \u00bc 0 and _a \u00bc ?2:723?=day\n\n182 S.R.

Similar to terrestrial applications, the relative\n\nnavigation benefits from a high level of common error cancellation. Furthermore,\n\nthe integer nature of double-difference carrier phase ambiguities can be exploited in\n\ncarrier phase differential GPS (CDGPS). Both aspects enable a substantially higher\n\nrelative accuracy than can be achieved in single-spacecraft navigation. Following\n\nan overview of spaceborne GPS receivers, the dynamical and measurement models\n\nfor relative navigation using single- or dual-frequency measurements are presented\n\nalong with a discussion of estimation schemes for real-time and offline applications.\n\nActual flight results from the TanDEM-X and PRISMA missions are presented to\n\ndemonstrate the feasibility of mm-level post-facto baseline determination and\n\ncm-level real-time navigation using CDGPS.\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nOriginally conceived as a purely military system, the Global Positioning System\n\n(GPS) has long evolved into a ubiquitous and indispensable tool for civil navigation\n\nand timing [1]. From car navigation to precision farming and from network time\n\nsynchronization to aircraft landing, a vast range of applications has evolved, which\n\nare enabled or at least supported by GPS. However, use of the Global Positioning\n\nSystem is not restricted to the immediate vicinity of the Earth alone. Similar signal\n\ncoverage can be achieved up to altitudes of at least 1,500 km, which covers most\n\nof the low Earth orbit (LEO) and opens the way for GPS navigation in space.\n\nO.

A wide range of space-capable\n\nGPS receivers is offered today and in fact most LEO satellites launched these\n\ndays are equipped with GPS receivers for either spacecraft operations or as science\n\ninstruments. While GPS tracking at high altitudes remains a persistent challenge,\n\nthe increased demand for GPS use in space has already resulted in the definition of a\n\ndedicated Space Service Volume [2] for the next generation of GPS satellites.\n\nFormation flying naturally depends on an accurate knowledge of the relative\n\nmotion of multiple spacecraft to acquire and maintain a given formation geometry.\n\nFor single-satellite navigation, absolute positioning accuracies in the 10\u20135 cm\n\nrange can presently be achieved with GPS depending on the timeliness\n\nrequirements (onboard real-time versus ground based offline processing), the hard-\n\nware capabilities (single versus dual-frequency receiver) and the sophistication of\n\nthe processing techniques. On the other hand, the full potential of GPS can best be\n\nexploited in relative navigation, where mm level positioning accuracies can be\n\nachieved through the use of differential carrier phase measurements (Fig. 5.1). This\n\nis well known in surveying, deformation monitoring and geodesy, but likewise\n\napplicable to formation flying missions in space [3].\n\nAs a rule of thumb, maintaining a formation of a given size requires a 10 times\n\nbetter control accuracy [4], which in turn requires a navigation accuracy that is\n\nbetter by yet another factor of ten. Many \u201cloose\u201d formations can thus be controlled\n\nbased on absolute orbit determination results for the individual spacecraft, but a\n\nrelative navigation technique is clearly advisable for close formation flight at\n\nseparations of less than 100 m.\n\nEvidently, the use of GPS based navigation is of primary relevance for formation\n\nflying missions in low Earth orbits, where one can fully benefit from a simultaneous\n\ntracking of numerous GPS satellites. Even though the subsequent presentation is\n\nfocussed on LEO applications, it should be mentioned that GPS-based relative\n\nnavigation is likewise considered for formation flying in highly elliptical orbits [5]\n\nAbsolute Navigation\n\nRelative Navigation\n\n10 m\n\n1m\n\n10 cm\n\n1cm\n\n1mm\n\nReal-time\n\nOffline\n\nReal-time\ndifferential\n\nReal-time\nnon-common GPS\n\nOffline\ndifferential\n\nFig. 5.1 Range of achievable\n\nGPS navigation accuracies\n\nusing absolute and relative\n\npositioning techniques\n\n186 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nor collocation of geostationary satellites. However, the achievable performance in\n\nthese orbits is certainly far below that in LEO formation flying missions due to a\n\nheavily constrained GPS visibility.\n\nThe present chapter starts with a discussion of spaceborne GPS technology and\n\nan overview of receivers that can be applied for spacecraft formation flying.\n\nFollowing a presentation of general principles and models for GPS-based orbit\n\ndetermination, the specific aspects of real-time relative navigation of formation\n\nflying spacecraft and the precise post-facto baseline reconstruction are discussed in\n\nmore detail. Flight data from the PRISMA and TanDEM-X formation flying\n\nmissions are used in the respective sections to illustrate the current status of carrier\n\nphase differential GPS navigation in onboard and ground applications.\n\n5.2 Spaceborne GPS Receivers\n\n5.2.1 SGPS Technology Aspects\n\nWhile the basic functionality of a spaceborne GPS (SGPS) receiver is the same as\n\nthat of a terrestrial or aeronautical receiver, its design has to properly account for\n\nthe high signal dynamics and the more hostile environment [6] in which these\n\nreceivers are operated. Whereas the signal tracking aspects can largely be handled\n\nby suitable adaptations of the core receiver software, the environmental robustness\n\nof space equipment is a continued source of concern and dedicated engineering and\n\nqualification standards have been established by relevant space agencies [7] and\n\nsatellite manufacturers. Key issues to be considered in this context include the\n\nresistance to thermal-vacuum conditions, vibration and shock loads as well as\n\nionizing radiation and single event effects. Besides a cost driving test and qualifi-\n\ncation effort that is implied by these standards, suitably qualified electronic\n\ncomponents are often less powerful and require higher resources (mass, power)\n\nthan state-of-the-art consumer electronics. Aside from technical issues, it has to be\n\nemphasized that the threat of a possible abuse of spaceborne GPS receivers for\n\nmilitary purposes imposes stringent export restrictions under both national and\n\ninternational export control laws [8, 9]. A free trade is only permitted for GPS\n\nreceivers which inhibit operation above altitudes of 18 km (60,000 ft) and velocities\n\nof greater than 515 m/s (1,000 nautical miles per hour), which clearly excludes their\n\nuse in orbit.\n\nFor a continued use in the space, the receiver components (baseband processor,\n\nCPU, memory, power conditioning) need to be sufficiently tolerant against the\n\ninfluence of space radiation. Radiation may cause both long-term effects, i.e. a\n\ngradual component aging, as well as single event effects (SEE) such as upsets\n\n(SEU) or latch-ups (SEL). Long-term effects are typically caused by ionization in\n\nthe electronics components which is described by the total ionization dose (TID).\n\nFor use in low Earth orbits (i.e. altitudes of several hundreds of kilometers) a TID of\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 187\n\n\n\nabout 10 krad should be tolerated, but substantially higher limits may apply for long\n\nduration missions with stringent reliability requirements. A large TID will, among\n\nothers, result in increased power consumption and an eventual failure of the device.\n\nThe sensitivity of individual components or an entire electronics board can be\n\ntested through irradiation with a radioactive Co-60 source. Board-level tests for\n\nvarious types of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) GPS receivers have shown a\n\nrepresentative TID tolerance of 5\u201315 krad [10], which often justifies their use in\n\nlow-cost micro- and nano-satellite missions.\n\nSingle-event effects are caused by individual high energy particles causing a\n\ntemporary build-up of free charges in the semi-conductor material. These may\n\ncause bit flips and software errors disturbing the proper function of a GPS receiver.\n\nMore severely, they may also trigger short circuits (through parasitic transistors)\n\nresulting in the release of excessive heat and often a permanent destruction of the\n\naffected chip area. While total dose effects can be reduced by external shielding,\n\nother means of protection are required for single event effects. In a fully space grade\n\ndesign, specific manufacturing processes, such as Silicon-on Insulator (SOI) tech-\n\nnology, may be applied to obtain radiation tolerant components. Memory contents\n\nmay further be protected by an error detection and correction (EDAC) code\n\nsupported through hard- or software. For COTS GPS receivers that do not incorpo-\n\nrate such features, a latch-up protection must be considered as a minimum to avoid\n\nthe risk of fatal damages. Fundamentally, a latch-up protection is a rapid electronic\n\nfuse, which shuts down the receiver power, if a non-nominal over-current is sensed.\n\nThe design of a proper latch-up protection and its overall feasibility depend\n\ncritically on the specific design of the employed receiver. Besides the nominal\n\npower consumption, the TID-induced current increase, the in-rush current and the\n\nenergy stored in capacitors have to be accounted for. SEL (and SEU) testing for\n\nspace electronics can only be performed in large accelerator labs and may comprise\n\nboth heavy-ion and proton irradiation (see e.g. [11]). So far, board level SEL tests\n\nhave only been conducted for a very limited number of COTS GPS receivers (such\n\nas the DLR Phoenix receiver [12] and the Javad Triumph receiver [13]) to demon-\n\nstrate the survivability of the respective devices in combination with specific power\n\nsupply and latch-up protection circuitry.\n\nIn addition to radiation, other, but generally less critical, environmental\n\nconditions must be taken care of, when selecting a GPS receiver for use in space.\n\nAmong others, the outgassing of components, vibration stress during launch and\n\nthe combined effects of temperature and vacuum need to be considered. Tempera-\n\nture ranges of ?30 to +60?C that might apply in a satellite are generally well\ncompatible with consumer electronic components, but care must be taken in the\n\nhardware design to enable adequate heat dissipation in the absence of convection.\n\nBesides hardware related effects of the space environment, the signal tracking\n\nand navigation software has to properly account for the specific conditions of\n\nan orbiting platform. Even though the signal levels encountered in LEO are almost\n\nidentical to those of a terrestrial or aeronautical receiver, the constellation of visible\n\nsatellites changes much more rapidly and the signal is subject to much more\n\npronounced line-of-sight velocities and accelerations. Also, mission specific,\n\n188 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nsub-optimal GPS antenna orientations may affect the capability of a spaceborne\n\nreceiver to properly track or acquire GPS signals. Concerning the signal dynamics,\n\npeak Doppler shifts of up to 45 kHz may be encountered by a LEO satellite, which\n\nresults in representative cold start times of about 10 min for a traditional sequential\n\nsignal search [14]. Modern receivers make use of dedicated fast acquisition units\n\nwith massively parallel correlators or Fourier-transform processing [15] to achieve\n\na substantially improved acquisition performance even under high dynamics. As an\n\nadvanced example, a cold-start time-to-first-fix of 60 s has been obtained for LEO\n\norbits with the Javad Triumph receiver selected for the ACES experiment onboard\n\nthe ISS [13].\n\nFor use in formation flying missions with demanding navigation and control\n\nrequirements, particular care must be taken to ensure a high overall accuracy of the\n\ncode and carrier phase measurements provided by the employed GPS receiver. As a\n\nrule of thumb, pseudorange measurements in a single-frequency receiver should\n\nexhibit an average noise level of 0.5 m or better, while carrier phases should be\n\naccurate to about 1 mm. In case of dual-frequency measurements, the ionosphere-\n\ncombination amplifies errors by a factor of three, which results in somewhat tighter\n\nbudgets for the individual measurements. To avoid systematic measurement errors,\n\nuse of a 3rd-order phase-locked-loop (PLL) is recommended for tracking the carrier\n\nphase of the C/A-code signal, while aided loops of lower order can typically be used\n\nfor code tracking and tracking of other signals. Further more, great care is required\n\nin the formation of measurements of a spaceborne GPS receiver envisaged for\n\nformation flying missions. Given the orbital velocity of a LEO satellite, even a\n\ntiming inconsistency of only 1 ms causes a 7 mm position error, which may not be\ntolerable for precise navigation. Such timing offsets have been identified in a\n\nvariety of geodetic space receivers [16] and a thorough receiver calibration in a\n\nsignal simulator testbed is therefore strongly advisable.\n\nWhen forming differential measurements from two spaceborne receivers\n\n(Sect. 5.3.1) it is likewise mandatory to synchronize the measurement epochs to\n\nroughly 0.1 ms, if mm-level relative navigation accuracies are desired. This is auto-\nmatically ensured by receivers that steer theirmeasurements to integer seconds ofGPS\n\ntime.Otherwise, the synchronization can in part be achieved by inter- or extrapolation,\n\nbut even then the physical measurement epochs should not differ by more than 1 ms.\n\nReceivers with free-floating measurements epochs require highly stable oscillators\n\nand extensive post-processing to achieve synchronized measurements.\n\nFinally, the GPS antenna system and its accommodation on the spacecraft must\n\nbe designed in accord with mission specific accuracy requirements. In order to\n\nfully exploit the high precision of differential carrier phase measurements for\n\nrelative navigation of satellites, use of a choke ring antenna is mandatory. Other-\n\nwise, multipath and nearfield distortions of the antenna phase pattern may cause\n\nsystematic carrier phase measurement errors of up to several centimeters. Even\n\nwhen using a choke ring antenna, phase center variations of up to 10 mm have been\n\nobserved in geodetic space missions that call for a dedicated ground and inflight\n\ncalibration [17, 18].\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 189\n\n\n\nAs concerns the frequency bands and signals required by a GPS receiver for\n\nformation flying applications in low Earth orbit, both single- and dual-frequency\n\nreceivers may be considered and have successfully been applied in actual missions.\n\nThe choice is ultimately driven by the dimension of the formation, the targeted\n\naccuracy and the available (technical and financial) budgets. Evidently, dual-frequency\n\nreceivers enable a rigorous elimination of ionospheric path delays and allow for a\n\nhighly accurate (5 cm level) absolute navigation. On the other hand, ionospheric\n\npath delays are effectively cancelled when differencing observations over short\n\nbaselines [19]. Depending on solar activity and accuracy requirements, single-\n\nfrequency receivers can thus be used for sub-centimeter level relative orbit\n\ndetermination of two spacecraft across distances of up to a few kilometers. With\n\nrespect to carrier phase ambiguity resolution, dual-frequency receivers offer addi-\n\ntional advantages through the availability of two independent carrier phase\n\nmeasurements. This enables, for example, the formulation of a wide-lane combi-\n\nnation, which exhibits a large effective wavelength of 86 cm and thus allows for a\n\nvery simple ambiguity resolution. However, the trade-off between single-and\n\ndual-frequency ambiguity resolution in formation flying missions with short and\n\nmoderate baselines remains a topic of further research and final conclusions may\n\nonly be possible after thorough analysis of flight data from the recently launched\n\nPRISMA and TanDEM-X missions (see Chaps. 21 and 13).\n\nEven though a variety of new GPS signals and new Global Navigation Satellite\n\nSystems (GNSS) are presently emerging, their impact on future formation flying\n\nmissions remains to be assessed. Evidently, the availability of new civil signals\n\n(such as GPS L2C, GPS L5, or Galileo E1 and E5) will ultimately replace the need\n\nfor semi-codeless tracking of the encrypted GPS P(Y)-code signals on the L1 and\n\nL2 frequencies and enable measurements with a presumably lower noise level.\n\nAlso, the use of tri-carrier measurements (GPS L1/L2/L5 or Galileo E1/E6/E5) is\n\nconsidered to enable an improved ambiguity resolution in differential navigation\n\napplications by various authors (see, e.g., [20]). It is unclear, though, when and to\n\nwhat extent the potential benefits of such new signals can be materialized and\n\nextensive research is pending to ensure a consistent measurement and processing\n\nquality across GNSS constellations and signals [21].\n\n5.2.2 Receivers\n\nAs illustrated by an annual review of the \u201cGPS World\u201d magazine, roughly 500\n\ndifferent GPS receiver models are presently offered by more than 70 manufacturers\n\nworld wide [22]. Compared by number of receiver units and total market volume,\n\nspaceborne GPS receivers certainly constitute a niche market even though the\n\nnumber of providers appears still large in view of the limited range of potential\n\ncustomers. Following Ref. [23] a total of 480 LEO satellites is expected to be\n\nlaunched between 2007 and 2016, which ultimately places a natural limit of roughly\n\n50 units per year to the demand for space grade GPS receivers.\n\n190 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_21\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_13\n\n\nThe small market segment and high specialization of SGPS receivers as well as\n\nthe associated test and qualification effort inevitably results in high unit cost\n\nranging from roughly 100 k\u20ac to 1 M\u20ac. Various companies and research institutes\nhave therefore made efforts to come up with low cost solutions based on the use of\n\ncommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components.\n\nWithin Europe, ESA has continuously supported and promoted the independent\n\ndevelopment of dual-frequency receivers for space applications through the AGGA\n\ncorrelator chip. The Advanced GPS/GLONASS ASIC (AGGA) was initially devel-\n\noped (version 0) by the Institute of Navigation, University of Leeds (UK) from\n\n1993\u20131995. Funded by ESA initiatives, the chip has evolved to version 2, which is\n\ncurrently used in the GRAS and Lagrange receivers for MetOp and GOCE and will\n\nlikewise be employed for the upcoming SWARM and Sentinel missions. As a\n\nsuccessor to the AGGA-2, the next generation AGGA-4 chip will support new signals\n\n(GPS L2C &L5, Galileo O/S), provide a larger number of channels (30\u201336), and\n\nexhibit a built-in 32-bit LEON microprocessor [24].\n\nAn overview of relevant GPS receivers currently in use or considered for space\n\nmissions is provided inTables 5.1 and 5.2 for single- and dual-frequencyGPS receivers,\n\nrespectively. Both spacegrade receiver designs and COTS receivers are considered.\n\nSo far, none of the listed receivers can support Galileo tracking, with the\n\nexception of the Javad Triumph receiver selected for the ACES payload onboard\n\nthe ISS.\n\nOut of the listed receivers, the MosaicGNSS, IGOR and Phoenix receivers are\n\npresently in use for actual formation flying missions (cf. Fig. 5.2). Other receivers\n\nsuch as the Viceroy and Tensor receivers have been used for relative navigation in\n\nshort term rendezvous missions to the MIR space station and the ISS.\n\n5.3 GPS Orbit Determination Principles\n\nWhile each GPS receiver computes its own navigation solution, it is generally\n\ndesirable in space applications to process GPS raw measurements in a separate\n\nnavigation filter or orbit determination process to achieve a higher accuracy and\n\nrobustness. The present section introduces the basic concepts of this processing\n\nand describes relevant models and algorithms.\n\n5.3.1 Observation Types and Measurement Models\n\nGPS receivers provide two basic measurement types that can be used for navigation\n\npurposes, namely pseudorange and carrier phase measurements [1, 38].

In practice the pseudorange differs from the geometric range by\n\nadditional clock offset contributions. In addition, the signal propagation time is\n\naffected by atmospheric delays, whenever the signal traverses the ionosphere or\n\ntroposphere. For orbiting spacecraft, the latter contribution is of no relevance and the\n\npseudorange measurement r can thus be modeled as\n\nr \u00bc r? rGPSj j \u00fe cdt? cdtGPS \u00fe I (5.1)\n\nHere r and rGPS denote the position of the user and GPS satellite antenna, dt and\ndtGPS are the offsets of the receiver and satellite clocks from the GPS system time\nand I denotes the ionospheric path delay. For the ease of presentation, measurement\nerrors such as multipath and receiver noise are ignored in this equation.\n\nCarrier phase measurements are obtained by mixing the incoming signal with a\n\ncarrier replica on the nominal signal frequency and measuring the phase of the\n\nresulting beat signal. Any variation in the distance between the GPS satellite and\n\nthe receiver causes a Doppler shift of the received signal and likewise of the beat\n\nfrequency. The carrier phase (or integrated Doppler) therefore constitutes a mea-\n\nsure of the distance change over time (but not the absolute distance). For conve-\n\nnience, the sign of the carrier phase measurement is chosen such as to match the\n\nvariation of the pseudorange. Depending on the application, the carrier phase\n\nmeasurement may either be expressed in range units (\u2019) or cycles (F). Both\nrepresentations differ by a wavelength factor l and can be modelled as\n\n\u2019 \u00bc lF \u00bc r? rGPSj j \u00fe cdt? cdtGPS ?

Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nwhere A is a (dimensionless) phase ambiguity that depends on the initial value\nassigned to the carrier phase measurement at start of tracking. The last term, finally\n\ndescribes the so-called phase wind-up that describes the change in the observed\n\ncarrier phase due to a time varying rotation angle C of the transmit and receiver\nantenna boresights with respect to the line of sight vector [39]. Similar to the\n\npseudorange, the carrier phase model includes two clock offset terms since the\n\nmeasured phase varies with the integrated frequency error of the GPS satellite and\n\nreceiver clocks. Comparing (5.1) and (5.2), it may further be noted that the\n\npropagation through the ionosphere results in a carrier phase change that is of\n\nequal size but different sign as compared to the ionospheric path delay affecting the\n\npseudorange measurement. This difference is caused by the fact that the ionosphere\n\nis an electrically charges plasma, where the group and phase velocity of a\n\nmodulated signal are affected in opposite manners [38]. Since the ionospheric\n\ndelay varies with the inverse square of the signal frequency f, it can be rigorously\neliminated by forming the ionosphere-free linear combination\n\nrIF \u00bc\nf 2L1\n\nf 2L1 ? f 2L2\n? rL1 ?\n\nf 2L2\nf 2L1 ? f 2L2\n\n? rL2 (5.3)\n\nof pseudorange measurements (or likewise carrier phases) on the L1 and L2\n\nfrequency. For single-frequency receivers, a ionosphere-free linear combination\n\ncan be obtained from the arithmetic mean of the pseudorange and carrier phase\n\nrGRAPHIC \u00bc\n1\n\n2\nr\u00fe \u2019\u00f0 \u00de; (5.4)\n\nwhich is known as GRAPHIC (GRoup and PHase Ionospheric Correction) mea-\n\nsurement [40].\n\nA course model of ionospheric path delays for orbital vehicles has been proposed\n\nby Lear [41]. Ignoring regional variations of the vertical total electron content\n\n(VTEC), the delay of an individual pseudorange measurement may be expressed as\n\nthe product I \u00bc I0 ? m\u00f0E\u00de of the vertical path delay\n\nI0 \u00bc 0:162 m ? f 2L1 f 2\n?? ? ?

The model is frequently\nemployed in simulations but can also be employed for coarse measurement\n\ncorrections in GPS based orbit determination or relative navigation [19, 42].\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 195\n\n\n\nWhile orbit determination of a single spacecraft may be affected by numerous\n\nerror sources (GPS orbit and clock errors, unmodelled atmospheric delays, antenna\n\nphase center variations and multipath) relative navigation over sufficiently short\n\nbaselines usually benefits from a high level of common error cancellation. This is\n\nmost obvious when working with receiver-receiver differenced observations. These\n\ncan be modeled as\n\nDrAB \u00bc rB ? rA \u00bc D r? rGPSj jAB \u00fe cDdtAB \u00fe DIAB\nD\u2019AB \u00bc \u2019B ? \u2019A \u00bc D r? rGPSj jAB \u00fe cDdtAB ? DIAB \u00fe lDAAB \u00fe lDCAB ;\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere D\u00f0?\u00deAB \u00bc \u00f0?\u00deB ? \u00f0?\u00deA denotes the single difference (SD) of quantities for\nspacecraft B and A, respectively. While the satellite clock offset contribution\n\ncancels immediately, the impact of GPS satellite ephemeris errors is strongly\n\nsuppressed for short separations. Similar considerations hold for the differential\n\nionospheric path delays that can typically be neglected for separations of 1 km or\n\nless. The differential phase wind-up effect vanishes on short baselines, if both\n\nreceiver antennas maintain the same attitude with respect to the transmitting GPS\n\nsatellite, but will have to be considered for spacecraft with notably different antenna\n\norientations [43]. However, this would likewise imply a restricted number of\n\ncommonly tracked GPS satellites and is therefore avoided in missions with strin-\n\ngent relative navigation requirements.\n\nBeyond the receiver-receiver difference, a satellite-satellite difference r\u00f0?\u00deij\n\u00bc r\u00f0?\u00dej ?r\u00f0?\u00dei may be formed to further eliminate the satellite clock offset.\nIgnoring the differential ionospheric path delays and phase wind-up, the resulting\n\ndouble difference (DD) depends primarily on the relative geometry of the GPS\n\nsatellites and the two receivers:\n\nrDrijAB \u00bc D r? rGPSj jijAB\nrD\u2019ijAB \u00bc D r? rGPSj jijAB\u00felrDAijAB\n\n(5.8)\n\nIn case of carrier phase measurements, the observation model always involves\n\nthe phase ambiguities, which are not known beforehand but have to be determined\n\nas part of the data processing. While the ambiguities are float values quantities, in\n\ngeneral, their double difference can be shown to be of integer nature for a properly\n\ndesigned GPS receiver [43]. Once the true integer value rDAijAB \u00bc NijAB of the DD\nambiguity is known, the carrier phase measurements are effectively translated into\n\npseudoranges with mm noise level and can thus be used to obtain high precision\n\ndifferential positions.\n\nConceptually, the integer ambiguities can indeed be obtained from the comparison\n\nof DD code and phase measurements (cf. (5.8)) and rounding to the nearest integer:\n\nNijAB \u00bc\n1\n\nl\nrD\u2019ijAB ?rDrijAB\n\n? ?? \t\nround\n\n(5.9)\n\n196 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nHowever, more advanced methods are required in practice for a robust ambigu-\n\nity fixing, particularly if large baselines result in non-negligible ionospheric path\n\ndelays. These include the use of special linear combinations as well as general\n\nsearch techniques [38, 44].\n\nWith dual-frequency measurements, a wide-lane combination\n\n\u2019WL \u00bc\nf L1\n\nf L1 ? f L2\n? \u2019L1 ?\n\nf L2\nf L1 ? f L2\n\n? \u2019L2 (5.10)\n\ncan be formed from the L1 and L2 carrier phases. Due to the larger effective\n\nwavelength of lWL \u00bc c=\u00f0f L1 ? f L2\u00de ? 0:86 m, the determination of the wide-lane\nambiguity NWL \u00bc NL1 ? NL2 using the integer rounding (5.9) is less sensitive to\npseudorange noise than that of the L1 and L2 measurements alone. Once the wide-\n\nlane ambiguity is known, the associated narrow-lane ambiguity NNL \u00bc NL1 \u00fe NL2\nand, finally, the individual L1 and L2 carrier phase ambiguities can be determined\n\nusing only carrier phase measurements. With the upcoming availability of three\n\nsignal frequencies in modernized GPS and the new Galileo system, the wide-laning\n\ntechnique may be extended by forming extra-widelane combinations (from L2 and\n\nL5 or E6 and E5 measurements) with an even longer effective wavelength.\n\nIn another class of ambiguity resolution method, the double-difference\n\nambiguities are considered as unknowns in a adjustment problem for the relative\n\nantenna positions at a larger set of measurement epochs. After linearization, a\n\nstandard least squares technique can be used to find the relative position and the\n\nfloat-valued DD ambiguities that minimize the residuals between the observations\n\nand the modeled measurements. However, what is actually desired is a solution,\n\nin which the permitted ambiguities are constrained to integer values.\n\nDifferent search techniques have been developed for this type of mixed real/integer\n\nproblems, among which the Least-squares Ambiguity Decorrelation Adjustment\n\n(LAMBDA; [45]) is probably the most popular and widely applied. It is based on an\n\ninteger-preserving transformation of the search space. This enables an efficient\n\ndetermination of the optimum ambiguities in the presence of pronounced\n\ncorrelations, which are naturally encountered in the dual-frequency processing.\n\nFurthermore, the LAMBDA method provides the algorithmic framework for\n\nvalidating the estimated ambiguities.\n\nIn the context of spacecraft formation flying the LAMBDA method and related\n\nvariants have been adopted by various authors both for simulation studies [46, 47]\n\nand actual flight data processing [48, 49]. A potential limitation in its application\n\nresults from the large number of ambiguity parameters (typically 1,000 per 24 h arc)\n\nthat need to be handled in a batch orbit determination for a satellite in low Earth orbit\n\nand may result in excessive computing times. Traditional wide-lane/narrow-lane\n\nambiguity resolution techniques have therefore been preferred by other researchers\n\n[50, 51] and are considered for on-board real-time applications [52]. Methods for\n\nbounding the number of past integer ambiguity states in a Kalman filter/smoother for\n\nspacecraft relative navigation have, furthermore, been studied byM.L. Psiaki [53] in\n\nan effort to limit the computational effort while retaining a near-optimal estimator.\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 197\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Dynamical Models\n\nFor close formations in near-circular orbits around the Earth, the relative motion\n\nof two spacecraft can conveniently be described by the well known Clohessy-\n\nWilthshire (CW) equations [54]. In the absence of perturbations, the relative\n\nmotion decomposes into a (periodic plus linear) in-plane motion and a harmonic\n\noscillation perpendicular to the orbital plane [55]. As an alternative to a purely\n\nCartesian formulation, relative orbital elements can be employed to describe the\n\nsolution of the CW equations, which facilitates the incorporation of Earth oblate-\n\nness perturbations and extends the applicability of the relative motion model for\n\nlarger along-track separations [56, 57]. To overcome the constraining\n\nsimplifications of the unperturbed CW equations, considerable effort has been\n\nmade to develop more sophisticated relative motion models for eccentric orbits [58,\n\n59] as well as different types of orbital perturbations [60\u201363]. While the resulting\n\nanalytical orbit models provide a high level of insight into the basic properties of\n\nrelative motion and form an excellent basis for formation design and controller\n\ndesign, more rigorous, numerical models are typically desired in GPS-based rela-\n\ntive navigation to comply with the high measurement accuracy.\n\nIt is therefore common to revert to a separate treatment of the individual\n\nsatellite trajectories using accurate models of the relevant accelerations a(t,r,v)\nas a function of time t, position r and velocity v rather than expanding the\ndifferential acceleration in terms of the relative separation. The resulting relative\n\nmotion can then be obtained by differencing the trajectories obtained from\n\nthe numerical integration of the equation of motion for each individual satellite in\n\nthe formation:\n\nDrAB\nDvAB\n\n\n ?\n\u00bc DrAB\n\nDvAB\n\n\n ?\n0\n\n\u00fe\nZ t\nt0\n\nvB\naB\u00f0t0; rB; vB\u00de\n\n\n ?\ndt0 ?\n\nZ t\nt0\n\nvA\naA\u00f0t0; rA; vA\u00de\n\n\n ?\ndt0\n\n(5.11)\n\nAlternatively, the difference of the individual accelerations can be formed and\n\nintegrated along with the equation of motion of a reference satellite:\n\nrA\nvB\n\nDrAB\nDvAB\n\n0\nBB@\n\n1\nCCA \u00bc\n\nrA\nvB\n\nDrAB\nDvAB\n\n0\nBB@\n\n1\nCCA\n\n0\n\n\u00fe\nZ t\nt0\n\nvA\naA\u00f0t0; rA; vA\u00de\n\nDvAB\naB\u00f0t0; rB \u00fe DrAB; vB \u00fe DvB\u00de ? aA\u00f0t0; rA; vA\u00de\n\n0\nBB@\n\n1\nCCAdt0\n(5.12)\n\nThe motion of each individual satellite is governed by various types of gravita-\n\ntional and non-gravitational forces that need to be accounted in the numerical\n\n198 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\ntrajectory modeling. Key contributions (in a rough order of importance) include the\n\naspherical gravitational field of the Earth, air drag, luni-solar gravitational\n\nperturbations, solar radiation pressure, solid Earth and ocean tides, relativistic\n\nperturbations, and Earth albedo. Relevant models are well documented in the\n\nastrodynamics literature and the reader is referred to relevant textbooks and articles\n\n(see Refs. [55, 64] and references therein) for detailed information.\n\nGravitational forces can, in general, be described by high-fidelity physical\n\nmodels with known parameters. The choice of models in a specific application is\n\ntherefore solely based on a trade-off between accuracy requirements and computa-\n\ntional complexity. While the full range of perturbations is considered in GPS\n\nprecise orbit determination tools [65\u201368], notable simplifications are commonly\n\nmade in real-time, onboard navigation systems [69, 70]. Non-gravitational force\n\nmodels, in contrast, suffer to a large extent from a limited knowledge of physical\n\nconditions (such as air density [71] or reflected Earth radiation) and satellite\n\nsurface/body properties (drag coefficients, reflectivity and absorption, etc.).\n\nTo achieve a high overall navigation accuracy despite force modeling limitations\n\nand to fully exploit the high geometric strength of GPS measurements, the\n\nconcept of reduced dynamics orbit determination has been introduced in Ref.\n\n[72]. Here, potential deficiencies in the a priori dynamical model are compensated\n\nby empirical accelerations that are estimated along with other adjustment\n\nparameters. In view of a more direct physical interpretation, a frame aligned with\n\nthe radial (R), along-track (T) and normal (N) direction is commonly used to\n\ndescribe these empirical accelerations. For GPS-based precise orbit determination\n\nof scientific satellites in low Earth orbit the adjustment of piece-wise constant RTN\n\naccelerations at intervals of 6\u201315 min has been adopted in many least-squares batch\n\norbit determination systems [67, 73]. For sequential estimation, in contrast, the\n\nempirical accelerations are best treated as exponentially correlated random\n\nvariables [67, 70, 72].\n\nOrbital maneuvers represent a special case of non-gravitational \u201cperturbation\u201d\n\nthat needs to be taken care of within the orbit determination process. Similar to the\n\nempirical accelerations, the RTN-frame represents a natural choice for the descrip-\n\ntion of in-plane or out-of-plane maneuvers. For a generic model, a constant thrust\n\nlevel can be assumed, even though actual thruster systems may employ a pulse\n\nwidth modulation and varying net thrust across the total burn duration. While\n\norbital maneuvers are rarely exercised in single satellite missions (once per week\n\nor month), the need for tight formation keeping may result in a much higher\n\nmaneuver frequency (from several burns per orbit to quasi-continuous thrusting).\n\nEven though some a priori information on the actual thrust or velocity increment is\n\ngenerally available (e.g., from the maneuver planning or onboard accelerometers)\n\nthe remaining uncertainties need to be covered as part of the navigation process.\n\nThis can be accomplished by a suitable increase of process noise in a sequential\n\nnavigation process or by a rigorous incorporation of maneuver states into the\n\nestimation parameter vector [74\u201377].\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 199\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Numerical Integration\n\nA wide range of numerical integration methods that can be used for satellite orbit\n\nmodeling is known in the literature (see Refs. [64, 78] and references therein) and\n\neach method exhibits different advantages and disadvantages. As such, there is no\n\nunique method that is ideal for all types of problems and the choice is largely\n\ndependent on the requirements of a specific application.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, higher order methods provide the best efficiency (in terms of\n\ncomputational cost versus accuracy) when integrating the orbital motion of a\n\nsatellite over large arcs without intermediate state updates or force model\n\ndiscontinuities (for example maneuvers). Multi-step methods provide the added\n\nadvantage that interpolated values of the trajectory can easily be obtained from\n\npre-computed data, which allows a decoupling of the integrator step size from the\n\ndesired output step size. A general purpose Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method that\n\nsupports variable order and stepsize and is well suitable for a wide range of orbital\n\nmechanics problems has been developed by Shampine and Gordon [64, 79]. The\n\nmethod is used for GPS-based precise orbit determination in the GHOST software\n\n[80], but a variety of alternative multi-step methods or collation methods has been\n\nadopted with great success in other software packages [65, 66, 68].\n\nLow order methods, in contrast are preferable if the required time step is only a\n\nsmall fraction of the orbital period. This situation is typically encountered in real-\n\ntime navigation systems where filter state updates are performed at time intervals in\n\nthe 1\u201330 s range. Following a measurement update, the trajectory integration has to\n\nbe restarted with a new state vector, which becomes highly inefficient for a high\n\norder integration method. In this case, the classical fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta\n\n(RK4) method represents a well justified choice, which combines the ease of use\n\nwith reasonable short term accuracy.

Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach, which has originally been proposed in Ref. [81],\n\ncombines the basic RK4 method with the concept of Richardson extrapolation\n\nto construct a fifth-order integration method with a lower number of derivative\n\ncomputations than would be required by any existing fifth-order RK method.\n\nGiven the initial value y(t), approximate solutions hh1 and h\nh\n2 at t + h and t + 2h\n\nare obtained from two consecutive RK4 steps of step size h. In addition a\nsingle RK4 step of size 2h is performed that delivers an independent approxi-\nmation h2h2 . Knowing that the error of the RK4 method grows with the fourth\npower of the step size, the difference of the two solutions at t + 2h can be used\nto extrapolate the solution to a fictitious step size of zero.

The method has successfully been applied in various real-time navigation\nsystems for single and multiple satellites [76, 77, 82, 83], where it enables dense\n\ntrajectory output without constraining the integrator and filter update interval.\n\n5.3.4 Estimation\n\nThe combination of the numerical trajectory model and the GPS measurement\n\nmodel enables a prediction of the measurements for a given set of initial conditions\n\nand model parameters. By comparing the difference of the actual observation and\n\nthe modeled measurements, corrections to the assumed parameters may be inferred\n\nto obtain an optimal estimate of the spacecraft position and related parameters.\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 201\n\n\n\nA wide range of estimation methods has been developed that may be divided into\n\nbatch and sequential estimators. By their very nature, batch least-squares estimation\n\nmethods are primarily employed in post-processing, where data collected over a\n\nlarger time span can be jointly processed to find the trajectory that best fits the entire\n\nset of measurements. Recursive estimation methods, in contrast, are favored in real-\n\ntime applications, where they can provide new estimates of the instantaneous state\n\nvector at each measurement epoch.\n\nThe batch least-squares orbit determination using GPS observations is typically\n\ncharacterized by a large number of estimation parameters. The need to adjust epoch\n\nwise clock offsets results already in about 3,000 unknowns per spacecraft when\n\nprocessing a 24 h data arc at a 30 s sampling interval. Empirical accelerations add\n\nanother 500 parameters per spacecraft considered in the orbit determination while\n\nthe number of ambiguity parameters may range from a minimum of 500 to more\n\nthan 1,000 (depending on the number of frequencies processed and the amount of\n\nphase discontinuities encountered in the data). Fortunately, the dimension of the\n\nresulting normal equations can be notably reduced by a pre-elimination of the clock\n\nparameters. To this end, the normal equations are partitioned into clock offset\n\nparameters and non-clock parameters (i.e., dynamical and ambiguity parameters).\n\nThe sub-block of the normal matrix related to clock offset parameters is a pure\n\ndiagonal matrix and can therefore be directly inverted and allows a formal elimina-\n\ntion of these parameters from the normal equations (see, e.g., Ref. [84]). The\n\nreduced system then has a much smaller dimension and can thus be solved with\n\nreasonable computational effort. For precise relative navigation (or \u201cbaseline\n\ndetermination\u201d), batch estimation strategies have so far been adopted by different\n\nresearchers using the Bernese [50], EPOS-OC [85] and ZOOM [51] software\n\npackages. Here, trajectory parameters and float valued ambiguities for the\n\nionosphere-free L1/L2 carrier phase combination of each individual spacecraft in\n\nthe formation are first determined similar to a single satellite precise orbit determi-\n\nnation. Thereafter double-difference ambiguities between GPS satellites and the\n\nformation flying spacecraft are resolved using a wide-lane/narrow-lane technique.\n\nFixed ambiguities are then treated as additional constraints in a final orbit determi-\n\nnation step that re-adjusts the (relative) trajectory and any unresolved ambiguity\n\nparameters.\n\nSequential estimation methods are a primary choice for onboard navigation\n\nsystems requiring continuous information on the instantaneous formation geome-\n\ntry. Nevertheless, the concept has also been adopted for offline processing in Refs.\n\n[48, 49], since it reduces the number of ambiguity parameters that need to be\n\nsimultaneously adjusted and fixed to the number of currently tracked channels. In\n\nthe sequel, we briefly review the concept of the extended Kalman filter (EKF, [86]),\n\nwhich is the best known and most widely applied sequential estimation method,\n\nbefore discussing the different choices for the set of estimation parameters in\n\nrelative navigation applications. For completeness, we mention that alternative\n\nfilter concepts such as the sigma point or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) have\n\nreceived increasing attention in recent years [87\u201389]. They promise a higher\n\nrobustness and improved convergence in case of non-linearities compared to the\n\n202 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nEKF. However, practical experience with actual flight data shows that the EKF\n\ndesign is fully suitable and sufficient for GPS-based relative navigation of LEO\n\nsatellites when working with reasonably accurate dynamical models and dense GPS\n\nmeasurements.\n\nThe extended Kalman filter is a recursive estimation method made up of a time-\n\nupdate step and a measurement update step. It starts with an initial value of the\n\nestimation state vector y\u00fei and the associated covariance P\n\u00fe\ni at epoch ti . The\n\nindividual components of the state vector, which comprises the spacecraft position\n\nand velocity along with various other adjustable force and measurements model\n\nparameters, is then propagated to the epoch ti\u00fe1 of the subsequent measurement.\nThe new position and velocity are obtained from a numerical integration of the\n\nequation of motion, while more simple models (assuming constancy or exponential\n\ndamping) are used to propagate force model coefficients, clock parameters and\n\nambiguities. Along with the propagated estimation state y?i\u00fe1 , the state transition\nmatrix Fi\u00fe1 \u00bc @yi\u00fe1=@yi is computed, from which the covariance\n\nP?i\u00fe1 \u00bc Fi\u00fe1P\u00fei\u00fe1FTi\u00fe1 (5.19)\n\nof the propagated state can then be obtained. Here, the superscript \u201c?\u201d is used to\nindicate quantities based on the propagation, while \u201c+\u201d denotes improved estimates\n\nobtained from the measurements processing. Statistical uncertainties in the state\n\npropagation can, furthermore, be taken into account by adding a process noise\n\nmatrix Qi\u00fe1 on the right hand side of (5.19). This completes the time-update step.\nWithin the measurement-update of the Kalman filter, a refined estimate\n\ny\u00fei\u00fe1 \u00bc y?i\u00fe1 \u00fe Ki\u00fe1 ? \u00f0zi\u00fe1 ? h\u00f0y?i\u00fe1\u00de\u00de (5.20)\n\nof the estimation state at the new epoch is computed from the residuals, i.e.,\n\nthe difference of actual observations zi\u00fe1 and modeled measurements h\u00f0y?i\u00fe1\u00de .\nThe Kalman gain\n\nKi\u00fe1 \u00bc P?i\u00fe1HTi\u00fe1 ? \u00f0Cov\u00f0zi\u00fe1\u00de ?Hi\u00fe1P?i\u00fe1HTi\u00fe1\u00de\n?1\n\n(5.21)\n\nwithHi\u00fe1 \u00bc @h\u00f0y\u00de=@yji\u00fe1 maps the residuals from the measurement space into the\nstate vector space, taking into account the covariance of the measurements and\n\nthe propagated state. The blending of information from the predicted state and the\n\nmeasurements, furthermore results in a decreased covariance\n\nP\u00fei\u00fe1 \u00bc \u00f01? Ki\u00fe1Hi\u00fe1\u00de ? P?i\u00fe1 (5.22)\n\nof the state vector following the measurement-update. Subsequently, the Kalman\n\nfilter proceeds recursively with the next time- and measurement-updates.\n\nThe equations given above describe only the most elementary form of the EKF and\n\nsome aspects deserve further mentioning. First of all, the covariance update equation\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 203\n\n\n\n(5.22) is prone to numerical errors and numerically stable variants of the filter\n\nequations (such asUD factorization [90])may be required in case of limited arithmetic\n\nprecision. Secondly, the \u201ctuning\u201d of the filter, i.e. the optimal choice of measurement\n\nweights, a priori covariances and process noise, may pose considerable challenges\n\nwhen working with actual flight data. While software simulations or hardware-in-the-\n\nloop simulations with known truth states can provide a good starting point, a need to\n\nre-adjust filter settings is typically encountered in real-world applications. To increase\n\nthe robustness of the filter in the presence of environmental uncertainties the use of an\n\nadaptive filter has been proposed and successfully demonstrated for relative naviga-\n\ntion of formation flying satellites by F.D. Busse [91]. A final remark concerns the use\n\nof the extended Kalman filter in offline processing for precise relative navigation (see\n\nRefs. [48, 49]). Other than in a batch least-squares processing, the state estimate in the\n\nEKF is only based on past observations when processing in the order of increasing\n\ntime. In the offline navigation, the filtermay instead be used to process the data in both\n\na forward and backwards direction and a smoothed solution can then be obtained from\n\ntheweighted average at each epoch [84]. The filter/smoother solution is typicallymore\n\naccurate and robust than the individual solutions and does not suffer from degradation\n\nin the start-up phase.\n\nBesides the use of a specific filter concept, the set of estimation parameters\n\nconsidered in the filter remains to be decided in the implementation of a navigation\n\nsystem. A wide range of different options has been considered by different authors\n\nand the following discussion aims to highlight a few aspects of general interest.\n\nFundamentally, the filter may comprise the following types of parameters:\n\n\u2022 the position and velocity (y \u00bc (r,v)) of the spacecraft under consideration;\n\u2022 parameters related to the dynamical motion model, such as drag (CD) and\n\nradiation pressure coefficients (CR), empirical accelerations (aemp), or\n\nmaneuvers (Dv);\n\u2022 the receiver clock offset (cdt);\n\u2022 ambiguity parameters (A) for single or dual frequency carrier phase\n\nmeasurements;\n\n\u2022 ionospheric parameters such as channel-wise path delays (I) (for dual-frequency\nprocessing) or a common vertical path delay (I0) (for single-frequency\nprocessing; cf. (5.5)\u2013(5.6)).\n\nMost of these parameters can either be handled as absolute quantities (i.e.,\n\nreferring to a single spacecraft) or relative quantities (i.e., describing the difference\n\nof the respective parameter for one s/c relative to a reference spacecraft in the\n\nformation) and both representations can be rigorously transformed into each other.\n\nAs mentioned in Sect. 5.3.2, the lack of suitably accurate relative motion models\n\nrequires the use of independent trajectory propagation for each spacecraft.\n\nIrrespective of the dynamical modeling, it can, nevertheless, be beneficial to\n\nconsider only the relative position and velocity in the filter to keep the number of\n\nstate parameters at a minimum. Such \u201crelative-only\u201d filters have, for example\n\nbeen proposed in Refs. [91\u201393] and [48], while a fully symmetric handling\n\nusing absolute state vectors for all spacecraft in the formation is preferred in\n\n204 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nRefs. [76, 77, 94] and [49]. Both approaches are perfectly legitimate and yield\n\nconsistent results, if a priori information on the relative dynamics is incorporated in\n\na proper and comparable manner. As an example, the relative empirical\n\naccelerations can be constrained more tightly in a formation involving nearly\n\nidentical spacecraft than the empirical acceleration for the absolute motion of\n\neach individual spacecraft. Similar considerations apply for constraints on\n\nionospheric path delays in a close formation, which favor a parameterization in\n\nterms of relative quantities. Clock offset parameters, on the other hand, are entirely\n\nuncorrelated for different receivers and a relative formulation provides no\n\nadvantages over the estimation of individual biases.\n\nAltogether, a minimum of about 18 parameters [92], to a maximum of about 80\n\nparameters [49] has to be considered in the various filter concepts assuming a\n\nrepresentative number of 12 tracking channels per receiver. Since each filter step\n\ninvolves extensive vector\u2013matrix operations that scale with the dimension of the\n\nfilter state, the computational effort for the measurement update may well exceed\n\nthat of the trajectory propagation and time update phase. Specific care in the choice\n\nof an optimum parameter set is therefore required for onboard navigation systems\n\nwith tight real-time requirements. Evidently there is no unique choice that can be\n\nrecommended for all types of applications and a trade-off between accuracy,\n\nrobustness and computational load will have to be made in each individual case.\n\n5.4 Mission Results\n\n5.4.1 Rendezvous Missions\n\nRelative navigation using differential GPS has first been applied in the context of\n\nvarious rendezvous missions and precursor experiments.\n\nIn Sep. 1995, a first relative navigation experiment was conducted on the STS-69\n\nflight of the Space Shuttle. It made use of a Rockwell-Collins 3M GPS receiver on\n\nthe Shuttle and a Turbo-Rogue receiver of JPL that was installed on the Wake\n\nShield Facility (WSF) free-flyer. While the envisaged real-time navigation demon-\n\nstration could not be performed as planned, the data were re-processed offline and\n\nused to demonstrate the feasibility for relative navigation at the 10\u2013100 m level\n\nusing as little as four pseudorange measurements [95].\n\nAs part of the ATV Rendezvous Precursor (ARP) project for the European\n\nAutomated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), a total of three flight experiments were\n\nconducted between 1996 and 1998. Flight Demonstration 1 (FD1) was performed\n\nin Nov./Dec. 1996 during the STS-80 flight of the Space Shuttle. It made use of a 9-\n\nchannel Laben Tensor GPS receiver on the free-flying Shuttle PAllet Satellite\n\n(SPAS) and a 6-channel Tans Quadrex receiver on the Shuttle. GPS data were\n\nrecorded for ground analysis but suffered from irregular sampling that inhibited a\n\ndirect double-differencing [96]. Following Ref. [97], an 8 m position accuracy and\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 205\n\n\n\na 3 cm/s velocity accuracy were achieved in a relative navigation filter processing\n\npseudoranges along with a Clohessy-Wiltshire orbit model. Two further\n\nexperiments (FD2, FD3) were conducted as part of the STS-84 (May 1997) and\n\nSTS-86 (Sep.\u2013Oct. 1997) flights of the Shuttle to the Russian MIR space station.\n\nData from the Laben receiver on the Shuttle and the Motorola Viceroy receiver [26]\n\nof the MOMSNAV payload on MIR were recorded onboard and later processed on\n\nground [98].\n\nBased on the experience gained in the ARP program, a GPS based real-time\n\nrelative navigation system was implemented for the autonomous approach of the\n\nATV to the International Space Station (ISS). The system is intended for approach\n\nnavigation in the 30\u20130.3 km distance range [28] and received its flight qualification\n\non the Jules Verne maiden flight of the ATV in April 2008. It processes data from\n\nthe 9-channel Laben Tensor GPS receiver on the ATV and the Russian 12-channel\n\nASN-M receiver onboard the ISS in a relative navigation filter (RGPS) based on the\n\nClohessy-Wiltshire dynamical model. Besides pseudorange or code phase data the\n\nfilter makes use of Doppler or carrier phase measurements to improve the velocity\n\nknowledge. Compared to the Flight Control Monitor (FCM) which employs a\n\nfiltering of the GPS receiver positioning fixes, the RGPS module of ATV achieved\n\naccuracies in the 10 m and 2 cm/s range [99].\n\nAlready 10 years before the ATV, a very first in-flight demonstration of GPS\n\nguided autonomous approach was successfully conducted in Aug. 1998 as part of\n\nthe Japanese ETS-VII mission [100]. The 2.5 t chaser spacecraft and the 0.4 t target\n\nsatellite were each equipped with a 6-channel GPS receiver that offered a\n\npseudorange accuracy of about 7 m and delta range accuracy of 1.5 cm (rms).\n\nBased on a filtering of differential pseudoranges and carrier phases a relative\n\nposition and velocity accuracy of 10 m and 3 cm/s, respectively, was obtained in\n\ncomparison to a post-processed trajectory. This is well within the specified limits of\n\n21 m and 5 cm/s established for the far range approach down to a 150 m distance.\n\nFurther improvements down to 5 m and 1 cm/s were later achieved offline by\n\nincorporation of carrier phase measurements [101].\n\nWhile all of the above results stay well below the accuracy potential of carrier\n\nphase based differential GPS navigation, they represent important milestones on the\n\nway to more advanced systems and important achievements based on the technol-\n\nogy available at that time.\n\n5.4.2 Precise Baseline Determination\n\nA precise, a posteriori reconstruction of the relative motion of two spacecraft is\n\nrequired in many formation flying missions to support the scientific mission\n\ngoals or to assess the real-time navigation and control performance. The most\n\nstringent accuracy requirements in this context have so far been formulated for\n\nSAR interferometry missions such as TanDEM-X (see Chap. 13). A primary goal\n\nof TanDEM-X consists in the generation of a global digital elevation model\n\n206 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\n(DEM) using cross-track interferometry [102]. Here, complex-valued SAR\n\nimages are simultaneously taken by two spacecraft and combined into an inter-\n\nferogram from which the terrain height can be derived. In this process, the line-\n\nof-sight component of the relative position (or \u201cbaseline\u201d) of the two SAR\n\nantennas must be known with utmost accuracy. At an X-band wavelength of\n\nonly 3 cm and a representative SAR incidence angle of about 30?, a line-of-sight\nbaseline error of 1 mm will result in vertical and horizontal DEM shifts of 1 and\n\n2 m, respectively [103].\n\nThe feasibility of precise baseline reconstruction based on GPS measurements\n\nhas first been demonstrated within the GRACE mission (see Chap. 19). Orbiting the\n\nEarth at a 450 km altitude and a mutual separation of about 200 km, the two\n\nGRACE satellites form a large gradiometer in space [104]. By measuring distance\n\nvariations between the satellites with a precision in the 10 mm range, the mission\nenables a detailed study of the Earth\u2019s gravity field and its variation in time. Even\n\nthough the primary instrument on GRACE is a K-band ranging system, the satellites\n\nmake use of high-grade dual-frequency GPS receivers for precise orbit determina-\n\ntion and timing [105]. As part of the mission operations, orbits of each individual\n\nsatellite with an estimated accuracy at the few cm level are determined on a routine\n\nbasis by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. While these exhibit a certain level of\n\ncommon errors, the relative position obtained from a differencing of the absolute\n\ntrajectories still exhibits representative errors of 10\u201320 mm (1 s) in comparison to\nthe high precision K-band measurements of the inter-satellite distance [84]. Early\n\nefforts for a fully differential orbit determination exploiting the integer nature of\n\ndouble difference carrier phase ambiguities resulted in baseline estimates with\n\nprecision of several mm in along-track direction [106] and an even better perfor-\n\nmance of <1 mm (cf. Fig. 5.3) was later achieved by researchers at TU Delft, JPL,\nand the University of Bern [48\u201350]. Due to the large separation of the GRACE\n\nsatellites, ionospheric path delays do not cancel and a rigorous resolution of the L1\n\nand L2 ambiguities is therefore required to achieve relative navigation solutions of\n\nthis quality. Following Ref. [48], success rates of about 85% could be achieved in\n\nthe dual-frequency ambiguity resolution.\n\nAn interesting opportunity to assess relative navigation concepts for shorter\n\nspacecraft separations occurred in late 2005 when the leading and trailing\n\n2007/12/01\n\n1.Dec 3h 6h 9h 12h 15h 18h 21h\n\nGPS Time\n\n?2.5\n?2.0\n?1.5\n?1.0\n?0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n\nK\nB\n\nR\n-R\n\nel\nN\n\nav\n [m\n\nm\n] ?0.00+/?0.74[mm]\n\nFig. 5.3 Comparison of GPS-derived distance of the GRACE satellites with K-band ranging\n\nmeasurements for a sample day in December 2007 based on processing with the FRNS baseline\n\nprocessing module of the GHOST software (see Ref.

For a period of about 12 h on Dec. 10 the spacecraft stayed\n\nwithin a distance of less than 10 km, thus enabling a study of differential\n\nionospheric path delays at short baselines [19] and the first flight demonstration\n\nof precise relative navigation using single-frequency carrier phase differential GPS.\n\nAccuracies of better than 2 mm (3D rms) were obtained for the single-frequency\n\nsolution (in comparison to the dual-frequency reference) during the proximity\n\nphase when using the Lear mapping function (5.6) along with an adjustable\n\nVTEC parameter to model the differential ionospheric path delays. Aside from a\n\nlower noise level of the individual carrier phase measurements, the single-\n\nfrequency processing benefits from a higher ambiguity fixing rate of up to 98%\n\nnear the encounter.\n\nUnfortunately, the K-band radar does not measure the absolute distance between\n\nthe two GRACE satellites but only distance changes. Therefore, it can only be used\n\nto assess the precision but not the accuracy of the GPS-based baseline determina-\n\ntion and provides no hint at all on the quality of the radial and cross-track\n\ncomponent. Inter-comparisons of GRACE baseline products derived by different\n\ninstitutions revealed the risk of systematic biases of up to several mm in the\n\nindividual baseline solutions [18]. While the nature of these biases is not finally\n\nunderstood, their presence illustrates the natural limitations of a microwave-based\n\nmeasurement system operating at a wavelength that is substantially larger than the\n\ndesired accuracy.\n\nEven though the GRACE mission itself never required a precise relative naviga-\n\ntion it paved the way for SAR interferometry missions that rely on GPS-based\n\nbaseline products of utmost accuracy. Key lessons learned from the GRACE data\n\nprocessing include the benefit of low noise carrier phase measurements from the\n\nC/A code tracking branch (rather than from the semi-codeless P(Y) tracking) and\n\nthe improvements achievable through empirical phase pattern corrections of the\n\nGPS antennas [17, 18, 50].\n\nThe TanDEM-X project builds directly on experience gained from the GRACE\n\nGPS data processing. The two spacecraft of the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X formation\n\nare equipped with high-grade dual-frequency GPS receivers contributed by the\n\nGeoForschungszentrum (GFZ). The Integrated GPS Occultation Receiver (IGOR;\n\nsee Fig. 5.2) selected for the mission represents a commercial rebuild of the\n\nBlackJack receiver flown earlier on numerous other science missions. On the\n\nTerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites it provides pseudorange and carrier phase\n\nmeasurements with a mean noise level of 15 cm and 0.7 mm, or, equivalently, 21 cm\n\nand 1 mm for the receiver-receiver single-difference (Fig. 5.4). Aside from precise\n\norbit and baseline determination, the GPS receivers are also used as radio science\n\ninstruments for atmospheric sounding. Such radio-occultation measurements of\n\nGPS satellites close to the Earth\u2019s limb enable the reconstruction of temperature\n\nand density profiles of the troposphere and are a key input for global weather\n\nmodels [107].\n\nAs part of the TanDEM-X mission requirements, a 1 mm (1D rms) baseline\n\naccuracy has been specified to avoid tilts and shifts in individual DEMs and to\n\n208 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nenable a flawless mosaicking. In view of the criticality of accurate baseline products\n\nfor the overall mission performance, the baseline generation is routinely performed\n\nby two processing centers at GFZ and the German Space Operations Center (DLR/\n\nGSOC). The two solutions are generated with different algorithms and tool chains\n\nto ensure maximum independence and to facilitate a basic consistency check.\n\nFurthermore, a merged baseline product is generated from a weighted average of\n\nthe individual solutions, which is then employed in the DEM generation [108].\n\nDue to the lack of an independent measurement system providing a truth\n\nreference, the inter-comparison of independently generated solutions provides the\n\nprimary means for assessing the quality of the TanDEM-X baseline products. As an\n\nexample, Fig. 5.5 shows the difference of two baseline products generated in the\n\nsingle- and dual-frequency processing, respectively, during the early mission phase,\n\nwhen the spacecraft were still separated by 20 km. The two solutions show a high\n\nlevel of consistency except for systematic biases at the 1\u20132 mm level. These can in\n\npart be attributed to phase pattern distortions that are corrected in the dual-\n\nfrequency solution but not the single-frequency processing.\n\n2010/08/08\n\n8.Aug 6h 12h 18h\n\nGPS Time\n\n?10\n?8\n?6\n?4\n?2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n\nC\nro\n\nss\n-t\n\nra\nck\n\n [m\nm\n\n] 1.46+/?0.64mm\n\nFig. 5.5 Difference of single- and dual-frequency solutions for the cross-track baseline of the\n\nTanDEM-X formation\n\n2010/08/18\n\n18.Aug 3h 6h 9h 12h 15h 18h 21h\n\n?1.2\n?1.0\n?0.8\n?0.6\n?0.4\n?0.2\n?0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n\nS\nD\n\n C\nod\n\ne \n[m\n\n]\n?0.07+/?0.21m\n\n2010/08/18\n\n18.Aug 3h 6h 9h 12h 15h 18h 21h\n\n?0.006\n?0.004\n?0.002\n0.000\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n\nS\nD\n\n P\nha\n\nse\n [m\n\n] 0.17+/?0.99mm\n\nFig. 5.4 Residuals of L1 single-difference pseudorange and carrier phase measurements from the\n\nIGOR receivers on TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 209\n\n\n\nA comparison of TanDEM-X baseline products generated by various agencies\n\nhas been presented in Ref. [109]. Here, differences with a standard deviation of\n\n0.5\u20131.0 mm per axis have been obtained between individual solutions, but system-\n\natic biases of similar size could likewise be identified. These biases reflect the\n\nimpact of different processing concepts and are of similar order as the biases\n\nobserved earlier in the GRACE mission.\n\nBeyond biases in the GPS-derived relative motion of the two spacecraft, the\n\ninterferometric SAR processing is likewise affected by uncertainties in the SAR\n\nantenna phase centers and instrumental delays. To assess the cumulative impact of\n\nall system specific biases on the measured instrument phase, dedicated calibration\n\ndata takes are performed on a routine basis in the TanDEM-X mission over flat\n\ntarget sites with well known altitude profiles. By comparison with uncalibrated raw\n\nDEMs from the SAR interferometry systematic biases may be identified and\n\ncorrected. Initial tests documented in Ref. [103] suggest residual biases at the\n\nlevel of a few mm, which is well within the pre-mission expectations. However, a\n\ncombined analysis of calibration data takes in different observations modes will be\n\nrequired to arrive at a consolidated system calibration.\n\nOther than the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellites, which are equipped with\n\nhigh-grade, dual-frequency GPS receivers, the PRISMA mission (Chap. 21) relies\n\nexclusively on single-frequency measurements for GPS-based relative navigation.\n\nComplementary to the real-time use (Sect. 5.4.3) the baseline between the two\n\nPRISMA satellites (named Mango and Tango) is reconstructed on ground from the\n\nPhoenix GPS (Fig. 5.2) raw measurements to provide a reference for assessing\n\nother sensors and the formation control performance [110]. Absolute orbits of the\n\nindividual satellites are first determined in a reduced dynamic orbit determination\n\nusing the ionosphere-free GRAPHIC combination (cf. (5.4); [67]) of the\n\npseudorange and carrier phase measurements. The subsequent precise baseline\n\nreconstruction makes use of an extended Kalman filter/smoother which processes\n\nsingle-difference code and carrier phase measurements and resolves double differ-\n\nence ambiguities. The filter builds on earlier work described in Ref. [84] but is\n\nspecifically adapted for single-frequency measurements. Instead of channel-wise\n\nionospheric path delays and L1/L2 ambiguities, the vertical path delay and\n\nL1-only ambiguities are adjusted in this mode of the relative orbit determination\n\nsoftware.\n\nThe differential carrier phase measurements exhibit post-fit residuals at the level\n\nof 6 mm, which clearly exceeds the value of 2 mm observed in pre-mission tests\n\nusing Phoenix GPS measurements from a signal simulator test bed [111]. This\n\nhigher error level is mainly attributed to lacking knowledge of the GPS antenna\n\nphase pattern distortions and a reduced attitude knowledge for the TANGO satel-\n\nlite. Carrier phase ambiguities can be fixed to integer values with success-rates of\n\nup to 95% in smooth mission phases with (near)-zenith-pointing GPS antennas and\n\nlimited thruster activity. During periods with heavy orbit and attitude maneuvers, in\n\ncontrast, processing reverted to a float-ambiguity-only solution.\n\nIn the absence of a truth reference only limited possibilities exist to assess the\n\nquality of the ground based relative orbit determination of PRISMA. One such\n\n210 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nopportunity was given during the early mission, when the two spacecraft were still\n\noperated in a clamped configuration. Despite a partial obstruction of the TANGO\n\nantenna field of view the estimated baseline was found to match the theoretical\n\nvalue with a better than 1 cm 3D rms accuracy when ambiguity fixing was\n\nemployed. In case of a float ambiguity solution, a degraded performance of 5 cm\n\n3D rms was obtained [110].\n\nDuring specific experiment campaigns, the separation of the two satellites could\n\nindependently be measured with the Formation Flying Radio Frequency sensor\n\n(FFRF; Chaps. 21 and 6) on PRISMA. Aside from a systematic bias reflecting an\n\nincomplete system calibration, the FFRF measurements agree with the GPS-\n\nderived distance at a noise level of less than 1 cm [112], which demonstrates a\n\ngood overall performance of both measurement systems.\n\n5.4.3 Real-Time Navigation\n\nThe first demonstration of precise onboard relative navigation based on carrier-\n\nphase differential GPS has been carried out by the PRISMA formation flying\n\nmission (Chap. 21). The GPS relative navigation system employs DLR\u2019s Phoenix\n\nreceivers (Sect. 5.2) and represents the primary formation flying sensor on-board\n\nthe PRISMA satellites. Its key objective is the continuous provision of accurate and\n\nreliable relative position and velocity information at all times during the mission.\n\nThe relative navigation state is used on-board the Mango spacecraft to autono-\n\nmously control its motion with respect to Tango throughout a multitude of experi-\n\nment scenarios including, among others, formation keeping and reconfiguration of\n\npassive relative orbits and quasi-continuous control of forced motion trajectories. In\n\nthe absence of a relative navigation system characterized by higher technology\n\nreadiness level, relative GPS represents also the safe mode sensor of the PRISMA\n\nformation. In particular the GPS relative navigation is used on-board Mango to\n\nsupport fault detection isolation and recovery (FDIR) functionalities like relative\n\nmotion monitoring and collision avoidance. The twofold scope of the GPS naviga-\n\ntion onboard PRISMA poses challenging requirements to the system design since\n\nultimate accuracy is desired for precision control purposes whereas robustness and\n\nreliability are needed for safe mode activities.\n\nIn order to fulfill these objectives, a tailored GPS hardware/software system has\n\nbeen designed for PRISMA [76, 77, 113]. The cold-redundant hardware architecture is\n\nidentical onMango and Tango. It is based on two single-frequency (L1) Phoenix GPS\n\nreceivers and two passive GPS antennas which are located at opposite sides of the\n\nspacecraft structure to provide a nearly omni-directional GPS coverage. Only one\n\nantenna is active at any time, but it is possible to select the desired GPS antenna in use\n\neither autonomously on-board or via telecommand from ground. The measurements\n\ncollected on Tango are provided to Mango through an Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF)\n\nInter-Satellite-Link and processed together with the Mango measurements by the\n\nnavigation software which is integrated into the FPGA-based LEON-3 Mango\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 211\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_21\n\n\non-board computer clocked at 24 MHz. The estimation approach employs a common\n\nEKF for the absolute states of the two satellites, which accounts for the interdepen-\n\ndency of absolute and relative navigation without the need of an explicit relative state.\n\nThank to the sequential processing of GRAPHIC data types and single-difference\n\ncarrier-phase measurements (Sect. 5.3.1), common GPS satellite visibility does not\n\nrepresent a prerequisite to estimate the relative state of the formation. In the case of\n\nrotating spacecraft with non-zenith pointing antennas, a relative navigation solution\n\ncan be obtained through the processing of un-differenced ionosphere-free\n\nmeasurements alone.\n\nThe PRISMA satellites have been launched aboard a Dnepr launcher from\n\nYasny, Russia, on June 15, 2010. The two satellites were released, clamped together\n\nin launch configuration, into a nominal dusk-dawn orbit at a mean altitude of\n\n757 km, 0.004 eccentricity and 98.28? inclination. After the successful accomplish-\nment of the launch and early operations phase, on June 17, 2010, PRISMA entered a\n\n57-days long commissioning phase. This phase was characterized by the careful\n\nverification and checkout of on-board equipment, essential on-board functions and\n\nby the calibration of navigation algorithms such as attitude, rate estimators, and\n\nGPS-based navigation. Most of the commissioning phase operates PRISMA as a\n\ncombined spacecraft where Tango is still mated to Mango. However, the last part of\n\nthis phase included the Tango separation from Mango (on August 11, 2010) and the\n\nsubsequent GPS relative navigation calibration campaign (5 days from August 16,\n\n2010). The flight results from the initial and final commissioning phase of the GPS\n\nnavigation system have been presented in Refs. [30, 110].\n\nThe adopted calibration process is based on a comparison of the real-time on-\n\nboard navigation estimates available in the telemetry stream with the post-facto\n\nprecise orbit determination products (Chap. 21) and consists of basically three\n\nsteps. First the navigation flight software is replayed on-ground and fed with the\n\nsame data inputs received on-board. To this end native GPS messages produced by\n\nthe Phoenix receivers, spacecraft attitude estimates of Mango and Tango, as well as\n\nmaneuver delta-v estimates from accelerometers are recorded on-board and\n\ndownloaded as telemetry. Once the data output of the flight software\u2019s playback\n\nmatch the on-board results, a tuning process can start where dedicated EKF\n\nparameters like e.g. measurements standard deviations, a-priori standard deviations\n\nof state parameters, data editing thresholds are changed in order to improve the\n\noverall behavior of the flight software in comparison with the precise orbit deter-\n\nmination. The third and final step of the calibration process is the upload of the\n\nnewly derived EKF parameters to the spacecraft. This approach proved to be\n\nextremely useful to improve the robustness of the navigation software in unfavor-\n\nable scenarios characterized for example by frequent data gaps, or spacecraft\n\ntumbling during safe modes. Furthermore the playback process enabled the rigor-\n\nous analysis and debugging of the navigation software behavior during two\n\nanomalies which resulted in the release of a new flight software version and its\n\nupload to the spacecraft.\n\nThe overall outcome of the extensive numerical and hardware-in-the-loop test-\n\ning performed before launch [113] and the in-flight calibration process resulted in\n\n212 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nthree possible configurations for the PRISMA GPS relative navigation, each given\n\nby dedicated settings for normal performance, frequent thrusting, and robust\n\nbehavior. Due to the satisfactory results obtained in orbit, no changes have been\n\nmade to the normal performance and frequent thrust configurations selected before\n\nlaunch during testing and validation. As compared to the normal performance,\n\nthe frequent thrust settings apply a ca. 10 times higher standard deviation to pseud-\n\norange and carrier-phase measurements. This reduces the weight of measurements\n\nand increases the trust in the force model thus providing more dynamic features to\n\nthe EKF. This approach can be better understood if we consider that a set of GPS\n\nmeasurements is processed every 30 s (sample time of the EKF) and frequent orbit\n\ncontrol phases activate 1-N thrusts at typical rates between two minutes and 10 s.\n\nThese are considered as extreme conditions for the navigation filter which augments\n\nits state to estimate delta-v maneuvers in real-time using a marginal number of\n\nobservations.\n\nOn the contrary the robust behavior configuration is a specific outcome of the\n\nflight commissioning phase. As recognized in orbit, the purely absolute formulation\n\nof the EKF does not allow the constraining of the relative empirical accelerations\n\nbetween co-orbiting spacecraft to the desired level without disrupting the estimates\n\nof the absolute empirical accelerations (Sect. 5.3.4). This inherent weakness of the\n\nfilter design became transparent during occasional phases characterized by frequent\n\nand consecutive data gaps of typically 20 min duration where the Phoenix receivers\n\nwere switched off to reduce the risk of radiation induced single event effects\n\n(Sect. 5.2). The application of the normal performance settings results in exces-\n\nsively large estimates of the empirical accelerations which act as a force during the\n\npropagation phase and consequently degrades the navigation accuracy. The replay\n\nand tuning on-ground of the navigation filter during the calibration phase in August\n\n2010 showed that ca. 100 times smaller standard deviation and noise of the\n\nempirical accelerations provide the desired robustness to the filter during contin-\n\ngency scenarios at the cost of a reduced absolute navigation accuracy. As a\n\nconsequence the so-called robust EKF settings have replaced the normal perfor-\n\nmance settings as default telecommands on-board and are usually applied in\n\nscenarios characterized by data gaps, spacecraft tumbling and in general during\n\nsafe mode activities.\n\nThe successful completion of the commissioning phase and the consolidation of\n\nthe real-time navigation filter parameters paved the way to the start of the nominal\n\nPRISMA mission. At the time of writing, nearly one year of primary experiments\n\nhave been successfully conducted without interruptions. The on-board navigation\n\nsolution is routinely used as trustworthy information for numerous autonomous\n\ntasks like relative motion monitoring, collision avoidance, formation keeping and\n\nreconfiguration as well as forced motion control. The GPS-based relative naviga-\n\ntion has been demonstrated to properly perform under all possible formation flying\n\nscenarios within the range of the Inter-Satellite-Link, i.e., between virtually 0 m (in\n\nclamped configuration) and 30 km (maximum separation achieved so far). Key\n\nflight results from the PRISMA GPS-based navigation system obtained during\n\nthe conduction of various experiments have been presented in Refs. [114\u2013116].\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 213\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6 illustrates representative on-board navigation errors obtained from the\n\ncomparison with the post-facto precise orbit determination. In order to show how\n\nthe navigation system behaves over the comprehensive range of scenarios offered\n\nby PRISMA, four different time arcs have been selected.\n\nFirst, sparse orbit control activities on April 4, 2011 are shown over 24 h.

Secondly, dense orbit control activities on November\n\n26, 2010 are considered over 3 h. Here frequent thrust settings are applied, the GPS\n\nantennas are near-zenith pointing, and the spacecraft separations are between 10\n\nand 20 m in forced motion. Third, a scenario characterized by periodic pitch\n\noscillations of ?30? from Zenith of the Mango GPS antennas is considered on\nMarch 22, 2011 over 12 h.

Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nMango is permanently pointing at the Tango spacecraft in a relative elliptic motion\n\ncentered at 500 mmean along-track separation with 200 m amplitude oscillations in\n\nradial and cross-track direction. Finally, a slow tumbling 360? pitch motion of\nMango is considered on March 31, 2011 over 3.5 h where the robust settings are\n\napplied and the usage of only one GPS antenna is forced during the once-per-orbit\n\nrotations of the spacecraft (ca. 0.06 deg/s).\n\nFor simplicity, the plots in Fig. 5.6 provide only the real-time navigation\n\naccuracy in the radial direction, which is characterized by the largest errors.\n\nHowever, full statistics of the 3D relative position and velocity errors are listed in\n\nTable 5.3 for completeness.\n\nIn most of the encountered scenarios, the demonstrated overall performance is\n\nwell below 10 cm and 1 mm/s (3D, rms) for relative position and velocity respec-\n\ntively. The navigation error budget is dominated by maneuver executions, attitude\n\nestimation errors, multi-path, and phase pattern distortions. As discovered during\n\nthe commissioning phase, the relative navigation accuracy does not degrade sub-\n\nstantially during large attitude motions of the Mango spacecraft [30]. Due to a\n\nlacking ground plane, the GPS antennas at the end of the solar panels are notably\n\nsensitive to signals received from the antenna backside and offer a near omni-\n\ndirectional visibility. Despite the lower signal-to-noise ratio of signals tracked at\n\nnegative elevations, the availability of commonly tracked satellites by the Phoenix\n\nreceivers on Mango and Tango strengthens the relative navigation whose accuracy\n\nis not dominated by the meter level noise of the GRAPHIC data types as expected\n\nfrom the system performance testing conducted before launch.\n\n5.5 Conclusion\n\nGPS-based relative positioning is an enabling technology for distributed sensors for\n\nEarth system monitoring. Especially in the context of formation flying missions,\n\nwhich are commonly considered to offer new or enhanced science opportunities,\n\nTable 5.3 Real-time onboard GPS-based relative navigation accuracy during representative\n\noperational scenarios including sparse/dense orbit maneuvering (first two rows) and small/large\n\nattitude rotations (last two rows)\n\nOperational scenario (date) and applied\nnavigation settings\n\nRel. position (cm), 3D Rel. velocity (mm/s), 3D\n\nMean Std Rms Std Mean Rms\n\nSparse orbit control (Apr. 4, 2011)\n\nNormal performance settings\n5.00 2.00 5.39 0.13 0.15 0.20\n\nDense orbit control (Nov. 26, 2011)\n\nFrequent thrust settings\n8.78 3.89 9.61 0.69 0.58 0.90\n\nSmall attitude rotations (Mar. 22, 2011)\n\nNormal performance settings\n5.49 2.39 5.99 0.14 0.14 0.20\n\nLarge attitude rotations (Mar. 31, 2011)\n\nRobust settings\n6.83 2.94 7.44 0.08 0.04 0.09\n\n5 GPS Based Relative Navigation 215\n\n\n\ndifferential GPS provides high-accuracy relative (and absolute) navigation at\n\nadequate cost.\n\nThe intensive research conducted in the past decade has demonstrated the\n\nsuitability of carrier-phase differential techniques for high-precision relative navi-\n\ngation of spacecraft in low Earth orbit. Carrier phase measurements offer a noise\n\ntwo to three order of magnitude lower than pseudorange measurements and,\n\nespecially in formation flying applications, benefit from a high level of common\n\nerror cancellation. If properly combined with a rigorous orbit dynamics model,\n\ndifferential carrier-phase enables mm to cm positioning accuracies in post-\n\nprocessing and real-time applications.\n\nSince the availability of an adequate relative navigation system is a prerequisite\n\nfor a successful formation flying mission, this chapter has presented the state-of-the-\n\nart of three key aspects which need to be carefully considered throughout the design\n\nand development: GPS hardware, estimation approach, and flight experience.\n\nA wide selection of spaceborne GPS receivers is offered by numerous suppliers,\n\nand some of them are presently in use for actual formation flying missions or have\n\nbeen used for relative navigation in short-term rendezvous. This includes fully\n\nspace qualified dual-frequency hardware for high-end projects as well as low-cost\n\nminiaturized receivers built around commercial-off-the-shelf components for tech-\n\nnology demonstrators.\n\nIn advanced space applications it is generally desirable to process GPS raw\n\nmeasurements in a dedicated on-ground or on-board orbit determination process to\n\nachieve a higher accuracy and robustness as compared to the receiver navigation\n\nsolution. To this end an introduction of the basic processing concepts has been\n\nprovided, including observation types, relevant dynamical models, and available\n\nestimation schemes.\n\nFinally, a summary of key flight results obtained from precursor experiments as\n\nwell as rendezvous and formation flying missions has been presented. Although the\n\nvery first in-flight demonstrations of GPS relative navigation with meter-level\n\naccuracy were already performed in the 1990s as part of various national rendez-\n\nvous programs, it took more than a decade to exploit the full potential of differential\n\ncarrier-phase techniques. Certainly much better performances could later be\n\nachieved in hardware-in-the-loop simulations using GPS signal simulators, but it\n\nis only since the GRACE mission that the feasibility of reconstructing the relative\n\nposition between co-orbiting spacecraft with mm-level accuracy has been proven.\n\nEven though the understanding and removal of all system specific biases still\n\nrepresents a tremendous challenge, the 3D baseline between the TanDEM-X\n\nsatellites, the first synthetic aperture radar interferometer in orbit, is nowadays\n\nroutinely determined with a consistency of 1\u20132 mm on-ground. Moreover the\n\nhigh technology readiness level reached by real-time relative GPS is clearly\n\ndemonstrated by the PRISMA satellites whose relative motion is autonomously\n\ncontrolled on a regular basis using a cm-accurate GPS-based relative navigation\n\nsystem as primary sensor.\n\nGiven the wide range of orbiting and proposed formation flying missions, a\n\nsingle navigation system will never be able to fulfill all functional and performance\n\n216 O. Montenbruck and S. D\u2019Amico\n\n\n\nrequirements. In fact, the use of differential GPS is typically restricted to\n\ncooperative missions in low Earth orbit, whereas independent optical or radiometric\n\nsensors are required for the approach to non-cooperative targets, for deep-space\n\nformation flying and for interferometric space telescopes. Nevertheless, the use of\n\nGPS has already been considered for high-altitude missions and even lunar naviga-\n\ntion despite severe performance restrictions that have to be expected at large\n\ndistances from the Earth.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Maessen, E. Gill, T. Grelier, and M. Delpech\n\nAbstract For distributed systems in space, knowledge of the relative position and\n\nvelocity is required to maintain the relative geometry of the satellites within certain\n\nboundaries. This knowledge can be obtained using an autonomous relative naviga-\n\ntion system based on radio frequency (RF) signals. The design aspects of such a\n\nsystem are detailed in this chapter. As all RF-based relative navigation systems are\n\nbased on GNSS technology, the discussion is limited to this technology only.\n\nNavigation is performed by measuring the range (rate) between the satellites,\n\nwhich allows, in combination with a relative dynamics model and the exchange\n\nof data between the satellites, an onboard estimation of the relative state of the\n\nsatellites. Obtaining accurate and unambiguous measurements requires a balanced\n\nsignal design that minimizes measurement errors, but which also takes into account\n\nmultiple access and formation safety considerations. Hardware-induced measure-\n\nment biases should be minimized and hardware (self-) calibration is mandatory to\n\nachieve satisfactory performance in space. Details on the design, testing, and\n\nperformance of one particular system, the FFRF, are provided.\n\nA/D Analog to digital\n\nAC Alternating current\n\nADCS Attitude determination and control system\n\nAFF Autonomous formation flying\n\nAFRL Air force research laboratory\n\nD.

Relative navigation can be performed in two\n\nways: (1) using external systems like GNSS or tracking stations to determine\n\nabsolute states that can be differenced or (2) using systems which are implemented\n\non the individual satellites in the formation and which provide relative information\n\nonly. This chapter deals with the latter option. This introductory section introduces\n\nthe need for such a relative navigation system, its basic principles, and the outline\n\nfor the remainder of the chapter.\n\n6.1.1 Need\n\nChapter 5 has shown that highly accurate relative navigation for Earth-orbiting\n\nformation flying satellites can be achieved using differential GNSS measurements.\n\nHowever, there are missions for which this type of relative navigation is not\n\nsufficient to obtain the required performance. These can be missions that demand\n\nextremely accurate relative navigation or missions where the orbit altitudes are,\n\nentirely or for a certain time period, higher than those of the GNSS constellations.\n\nIn addition, it might be desirable to have a supplementary system next to the relative\n\nGNSS system as a back-up or for cross-calibration purposes.\n\n6.1.2 Basic Principles\n\nRelative navigation deals with the estimation of a set of parameters which suffi-\n\nciently defines the relative state of two platforms at a certain epoch. As shown in\n\nFig. 6.1, physical measurements and both absolute and relative dynamics models\n\nare used to produce this estimate.\n\nHere, the physical measurements constitute a number of RF range (rate)\n\nmeasurements between a transmitter and a receiver. Figure 6.1 also shows the\n\nRange (rate) measurement\n\nSignal generation\nand\n\ntransmission\nAttenuation\n\nSignal reception and\ntreatment (front-end)\n\nRange (rate)\nmeasurement (back-\n\nend)\n\nRelative state\nestimate\n\nRelative state \nestimator\n\nRelative attitude\nestimate\n\nAbsolute and \nrelative dynamics\n\nmodels\n\nFig. 6.1 RF-based relative navigation principle\n\n228 D. Maessen et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_5\n\n\nrelative attitude estimate as an input for the relative state estimator since this\n\ninformation is needed to convert the measurements from their local reference\n\nframe to a co-rotating or inertial reference frame in case measurements are not\n\nobtained from external systems like GNSS. Relative attitude information can be\n\nobtained by differencing the inertial attitudes of the platforms, as determined by\n\ntheir Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), or by using multiple\n\ntransmitters and receivers provided that these are present in sufficient quantity\n\n(hence the dashed line in Fig. 6.1). In addition, accurate time-tagging of\n\nthe measurements and relative attitude estimates is essential to produce an accurate\n\nrelative state estimate.\n\n6.1.3 Chapter Outline\n\nThis chapter is structured as follows. First, the overall concept of relative navigation\n\nusing locally generated ranging signals is discussed. This is followed by a descrip-\n\ntion of the system design on signal and hardware level. Next, examples are given of\n\nexisting system designs and their performances. The chapter ends with conclusions\n\nand an outlook for future system improvements.\n\n6.2 Relative Navigation\n\nThe main objective of relative navigation is to determine the relative state\n\n(e.g., relative position and velocity) of two platforms at a certain epoch. The focus\n\nhere is on methods commonly applied in relative navigation for formation flying\n\nsatellites. The section first discusses the nature and the modeling of the observations\n\nwhich serve as inputs to the relative state estimation, which is detailed in the second\n\npart of the section.\n\n6.2.1 Observations\n\nIn RF-based relative navigation, ranging signals are used to measure range or range\n\nrate between two objects. In the present discussion, we will mainly focus on\n\nrange measurements as these provide information that is typically better suited\n\nfor the relative navigation. Range rate measurements are assumed to be available as\n\nadditional measurements. We first introduce the basic range (rate) measurement\n\ntechniques and list typical error sources that need to be dealt with in order\n\nto achieve high ranging accuracy. Next, we model the measurements made using\n\ncode or carrier observations. From these, we can construct range and clock\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 229\n\n\n\nbias estimates. In case of multiple receiving antennas, angular measurements can be\n\nconstructed based on the difference in their measured range.\n\n6.2.1.1 Ranging Principles\n\nWhen using RF signals to directly estimate the range between two points, two\n\nbasic measurement types are possible, namely time-of-flight (requires\n\nknowledge of the time tTx when the signal is radiated) and carrier phase shift\n(requires knowledge of the signal phase when radiated). A direct estimate of the\n\nchange in range can be obtained by measuring Doppler shift (requires knowledge\n\nof the transmitter frequency fTx). Equations 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 provide the basic\nrelationships for time-of-flight measurement, phase measurement and Doppler\n\nmeasurement respectively [1]\n\nrt \u00bc ct \u00bc cDt \u00bc c tRx ? tTx\u00f0 \u00de (6.1)\n\nr\u2019 \u00bc l\n2p\n\nD\u2019 \u00bc l\n2p\n\n\u2019Rx ? \u2019Tx\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nc\n\n2pf\n\u2019Rx ? \u2019Tx\u00f0 \u00de (6.2)\n\n_r \u00bc ?cDf\nfTx\n\n\u00bc c fTx ? fRx\nfTx\n\n: (6.3)\n\nIn the above equations, r denotes range, _rdenotes range rate,D denotes arithmetic\ndifference, c denotes the speed of light in vacuum, t denotes time-of-flight, l denotes\ncarrier wavelength, \u2019 denotes carrier phase, and f denotes frequency. The subscripts\nRx and Tx denote the receiver and the transmitter, respectively. These observations\n\ncan be performed using one-way or two-way ranging signals. In the former method,\n\nthe transmitter is located on one platform and sends the ranging signal to a different\n\nplatform where it is received and processed. In the latter method, the transmitter\n\nsends a signal to the other platform where it is either reflected (radar) or received,\n\namplified, re-transmitted at a different frequency (transponder) and finally received\n\nand processed at the original transmitting platform. In case of a two-way ranging\n\nmethod, the result obtained from (6.1) to (6.3) needs to be divided by two to obtain\n\nthe range (rate) between the platforms. Note that in case of using of a transponder the\n\nre-transmission delay at the transponder has to be known and needs to be stable over\n\ntime. In addition, to obtain accurate results, the relative motion between the vehicles\n\nduring the signal travel time needs to be taken into account. This is not done in (6.1),\n\n(6.2) and (6.3). Phase measurements can be used to construct highly accurate range\n\nand angular measurements, which are treated in Sect. 6.2.1.3.\n\nFor all ranging methods, the measurements are affected by errors. The most\n\nimportant error sources for space-based relative navigation are:\n\n\u2022 Ionosphere (if present): The free electrons in this dispersive medium cause a\nfrequency dependent carrier phase advancement (i.e., shorter apparent range)\n\n230 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nand group (code) retardation (i.e., longer apparent range) of a modulated RF\n\nsignal. As the effect is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency, the\n\ninduced error can be eliminated by performing measurements using multiple\n\nfrequencies and adding these in a linear fashion to form a \u2018synthesized\u2019\n\nionosphere-free measurement. This comes however at the price of increased\n\ncontributions from other error sources if these are uncorrelated with signal\n\nfrequency. Alternatively, knowledge on the variation of total electron content\n\n(TEC) can be used to mitigate this effect in case of a single frequency ranging\n\nsystem. If measurements from different receiver antennas are differenced on the\n\nsame satellite, this error is cancelled.\n\n\u2022 Multipath: This phenomenon is caused by the reception of reflected replicas of\nthe desired signal. Since the path traveled by a reflection is longer than the direct\n\npath, multipath signals are delayed with respect to the direct signal. In addition,\n\nthe signal power of the multipath signals is less than that of the direct signal.\n\nHowever, since the reflection is caused by the receiving satellite structure, the\n\ndelay is very small (order of ns) and is thus very difficult to separate from the\n\ndirect signal. Currently, mitigation of this effect can only be achieved by means\n\nof calibration, which is further elaborated in Sect. 6.4.3.\n\n\u2022 Thermal noise in receiver hardware: This results from random variations in\ncurrent or voltage caused by the random movement of electrons due to thermal\n\nenergy. Thermal noise can be reduced by reducing the temperature of the circuit.\n\n\u2022 Receiver resolution: Due to the use of digital equipment, the measurement\naccuracy is limited by the granularity of the receiver equipment (e.g., correlator\n\nspacing, analog-to-digital quantization error).\n\n\u2022 Receiver bias: Signals are delayed as they travel through the antenna, analog\nhardware (RF and intermediate frequency (IF) filters, low noise amplifiers\n\n(LNAs), mixers) and digital processing until the point where the measurements\n\nare physically made. This causes an artificial ranging bias which must be\n\ncalibrated out. However, as this bias is not constant over time due to temperature\n\ndifferences and component aging, the system must be able to perform\n\nself-calibration once in orbit. Impedance mismatch causing hardware-induced\n\nmultipath must also be prevented.\n\n\u2022 Phase windup: A circularly polarized antenna\u2019s phase depends directly on the\nantenna\u2019s orientation with respect to the signal source. As a result, the observed\n\ncarrier phase depends on the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiv-\n\ning antennas as well as the direction of the line of sight between them. Changing\n\nthe receiver antenna orientation changes the reference direction and thus the\n\nmeasured phase. Similarly, changing the orientation of the transmitting antenna\n\nchanges the direction of the electric field at the transmitting antenna and\n\nsubsequently that at the receiving antenna. The result is also a change in the\n\nmeasured phase. As one or both of the antennas rotate, the phase change\n\naccumulates and is referred to as phase wind-up. In addition, the rotation of\n\nthe receiving antenna causes an apparent change in the carrier frequency. It is\n\ndistinguished from the normal Doppler shift in that phase wind-up is carrier-\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 231\n\n\n\nfrequency independent and does not affect ranging modulation group delay. The\n\npolarization-induced frequency shift is sometimes called rotational Doppler.\n\n\u2022 RF signal interference: RF-based relative navigation in space will predomi-\nnantly be affected by self-interference. Depending on the multiple access\n\nscheme chosen for the inter-satellite links, this interference can be in-band or\n\nout-of-band. When the received signals have similar power levels and are\n\northogonal to each other, the receiver can acquire the correct signal with little\n\ndifficulty. Only when the power level of the interfering signal is much higher\n\nthan the power level of the desired signal there is a chance that the receiver\n\ncannot lock onto the desired signal since it is \u2018drowned\u2019 in the noise caused by\n\nthe interferer. Telemetry (TM) and telecommand (TC) signals can also interfere\n\nharmfully with the inter-satellite links, as is the case in the PRISMA mission.\n\nThere, this is solved by applying appropriate filtering [2].\n\n\u2022 Antenna phase center location: Since the true phase center of an antenna can be\noffset from its geometric center by several mm, this is a significant error source\n\nfor very accurate range measurements. The antenna phase center location is also\n\na function of pointing angle (azimuth and elevation) and will thus change if there\n\nis any significant relative motion. Uncertainties in the location of the antenna\n\nwith respect to the satellite center of mass further contribute to this error.\n\nExtensive calibration is needed to minimize this error.\n\n\u2022 Relative clock drift: As for navigation with GNSS, the clocks commonly applied\non formation flying satellites exhibit non-negligible relative drift in time and are\n\nnot actively synchronized. This causes a non-negligible bias in the range mea-\n\nsurement in case of one-way ranging. This bias can be estimated using an\n\nadditional range measurement. This is further elaborated on in Sect. 6.2.1.2.\n\n6.2.1.2 Code and Carrier Observations\n\nCode and carrier observations are both phase shift measurements and are therefore\n\nambiguous in nature since it is unknown, without extra information, how many\n\ncomplete cycles are between the transmitter and the receiver. The only situation for\n\nwhich this ambiguity is not present is for code and carrier periods longer than the\n\ndistance to be measured. For all other cases, extra information is needed to resolve\n\nthe ambiguity. For any signal modulated with a ranging code, carrier phase\n\nobservations, due to their shorter period, will result in more accurate range estimates\n\nthan code observations. Therefore, it is highly desirable to resolve the ambiguity on\n\nthe carrier phase. A typical phase measurement accuracy is 0.1 rad (1s) [3] for code\nand carrier phase measurements, leading to measurement accuracies of ~1.6 m for\n\ncode wavelengths of 100 m and ~2.2 mm for carrier frequencies of 2.2 GHz\n\n(S-band). Unfortunately, resolving the ambiguity on the carrier phase measurement\n\nis difficult. It is treated briefly in Sect. 6.2.2.3. For now, we assume this ambiguity to\n\nbe known.\n\nFor space systems employing one-way ranging, due to non-synchronized clocks\n\non the transmitter and the receiver, a relative clock bias will exist that will greatly\n\n232 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nincrease the error in the range measurement. Thus, this bias needs to be resolved.\n\nThis is done using two range measurements, one from platform A to platform B and\n\nanother one from platform B to platform A. This method is known as dual one-way\n\nranging and is common practice in RF-based relative navigation. Throughout the\n\nremainder of this chapter, it will be assumed that this method is used to perform the\n\ninter-satellite range measurements. Following Ref. [4], dual one-way ranging\n\nresults in the following fractional phase measurements\n\n\u2019BA t1\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u2019A t1\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe d\u2019A t1\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? ? \u2019B t1 ? t1\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe d\u2019B t1 ? t1\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? \u00fe EA\n\u2019AB t2\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u2019B t2\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe d\u2019B t2\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? ? \u2019A t2 ? t2\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe d\u2019A t2 ? t2\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ? \u00fe EB\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere \u2019BA t1\u00f0 \u00de and \u2019AB t2\u00f0 \u00de represent the phase measurements at times t1 and t2 at\nreceivers A and B respectively due to signals transmitted at times t1\u2013t1 and t2\u2013t2.\nThese consist out of the difference between the received phase \u2019(t) and the\nreference phase \u2019(t\u2013t), phase noise due to oscillator instability d\u2019 and a lumped\nerror term E including ionospheric delay, signal multipath, hardware induced noise,\netc. The signal travel time, or time-of-flight, is denoted as t.

For ambiguous code-based range measurements, N can be determined by\nproviding data on the time of transmission of the ranging signal. When this is\n\nknown, the phase measurement can be converted to meters by multiplying with the\n\nwavelength l of the signal and dividing by 2p to obtain an estimate for\nthe pseudorange r:\n\nr? \u00bc lcode\n2p\n\ncD\u2019\u00fe lcodeN: (6.9)\nSimilarly, the clock bias Dt is estimated as\n\nbDt \u00bc lcarrier\n2pc\n\ndDd\u2019: (6.10)\nNote that in the above, we have made no distinction between code and carrier\n\nobservations, which is made possible by collecting all non-oscillator related errors\n\nin a common error term E. The same approach can be applied to Doppler\nmeasurements to obtain estimates for the range rate and relative clock drift.\n\nThe contribution of lumped errors practically vanishes for the clock bias estimation\n\nbut is still significant for the pseudorange estimate. The effect of these errors can be\n\nreduced using techniques already treated in Sect. 6.2.1.1.\n\n6.2.1.3 Line-of-Sight Observations\n\nA very rough initial estimate of the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) between two satellites can\n\nbe obtained by using code-based pseudorange observations and received signal\n\npower levels. This requires knowledge on the original power level of the transmit-\n\nted signal and the variation of the receiving antenna\u2019s gain with the angle from the\n\nantenna boresight. The resulting LOS estimate typically has an accuracy of tens of\n\ndegrees. When phase measurements are made at two antennas, it is possible to\n\nconstruct a much more accurate derived observation of the LOS of the antenna\n\nbaseline with respect to the transmitter. This is depicted in Fig. 6.2 where the\n\nranging signal of a faraway transmitter (dotted cyan arrows) arrives at antennas\n\n1\n\nb\n\nd\n\nq\n\n2\n\nFig. 6.2 Definition of LOS\n\n234 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\n1 and 2. When the path difference d (dashed purple line) and the antenna baseline\nlength b (black arrow) are known, the LOS angle y is computed as\n\ny \u00bc sin?1 d\nb\n\n? ?\n: (6.11)\n\nWith a third antenna, a second LOS angle can be obtained. These angles allow\n\nthe creation of a unitary LOS vector and hence the direction of the transmitter is\n\nknown in the local frame. Addition of a range measurement then allows estimation\n\nof the position of the transmitter in the local frame of the receiving satellite.\n\nA difficulty of this method is that, for highly accurate LOS angle determination,\n\nthe path difference needs to be determined using carrier phase measurements.\n\nSince only the fractional phase is measured, the integer number of carrier wave\n\ncycles in d is generally unknown. Relative attitude information from the ADCS\ncannot be used to solve this ambiguity. Therefore, there exists an integer ambiguity\n\nproblem on both LOS and range. A long wavelength for the carrier signal can\n\npotentially remove the ambiguity problem, but then the phase measurement is\n\nrelatively inaccurate, leading to a poor LOS estimate. Methods to solve the integer\n\nambiguity problem are treated in Sect. 6.2.2.3.\n\n6.2.2 Relative State Estimation\n\nThis section deals with all aspects involved in the estimation of the relative state of\n\ntwo formation flying satellites. We will start by briefly mentioning the states that\n\nare typically to be estimated. Next, some commonly used dynamic models that\n\ndescribe the relative motion in the local orbital frame are introduced. We then have\n\na look at some methods that are utilized to resolve the integer ambiguity in\n\nthe carrier phase measurements, which is vital for accurate navigation solutions.\n\nLastly, we briefly touch upon the estimation itself.\n\n6.2.2.1 State Vector Components\n\nThe estimation of the relative state of the satellites relies on the treatment of various\n\nmeasurements. These measurements can be obtained from the RF-based relative\n\nnavigation system, but can also be provided by other sensors (GNSS sensors are not\n\nconsidered here). We will first discuss the states that can only be estimated by\n\nmaking use of the measurements from the RF-based relative navigation system.\n\nThereafter we will treat the states that can be estimated using different sensors.\n\nAssuming that the parameterization is performed using rectilinear coordinates,\n\nthe relative state vector will contain at least three states x, y, z to describe the\nrelative position r \u00bc x; y; z\u00f0 \u00deT , three states _x; _y; _z to describe the relative velocity\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 235\n\n\n\nv \u00bc _x; _y; _z\u00f0 \u00deT, and a state Dt to describe the relative clock bias. Next to these seven\n\u2018basic\u2019 states, three states to describe non-modeled (empirical) relative accelerations\n\nax, ay, az can be used to improve the estimation results. The integer ambiguities N in\nthe phase measurements for all carrier signals used also need to be estimated if high\n\naccuracy is desired. The estimation of LOS biasesDxLOS andDyLOS and a range bias\nDr is also advisable as these can persist even after calibration. Furthermore, if the\napplied dynamic model allows for it, the differential atmospheric drag coefficient\n\nDCD can also be estimated. The estimation of relative clock driftD _twill also improve\nthe relative navigation solution. Depending on the orbital altitude, it can also be\n\nnecessary to estimate the ionospheric path delay I. Thus, the number of states that\ncan/must be estimated using an RF-based relative navigation system can be up to 18\n\n(assuming a dual frequency ranging system) for a two-satellite formation.\n\nThe estimation of the relative position and velocity and the LOS bias requires an\n\nestimate of the relative attitude. This is needed to transform the measurements from\n\nthe body frame to the local orbital frame. For the LOS biases this is needed since\n\nthese are dependent on the relative attitude. In case the two satellites are equipped\n\nwith multiple transmitters and receivers or if there are more than two satellites in\n\nthe formation and if signals can be transmitted and received between all satellites,\n\nthen it is in principle possible to estimate the relative attitude of the satellites using\n\nmeasurements from the RF-based relative navigation system [6]. If this is not the\n\ncase, relative attitude must come from differencing the absolute attitude estimates\n\nof the satellites. To enhance the estimator\u2019s responsiveness to maneuvers, three\n\nstates are needed to fully estimate all delta-V components. The estimation of these\n\nstates requires information from onboard accelerometers.\n\n6.2.2.2 Relative Dynamics Modeling\n\nThe relative motion of two satellites is commonly expressed in a co-orbiting local\n\norbital reference frame. Many denominations exist for this frame but of these the\n\nLocal Vertical Local Horizontal (LVLH), Radial-Tangential-Normal (RTN), and\n\nHill frame are the most common. The orientation of this frame changes in time and\n\ncan be inferred from the Earth-centered inertial position vector R and inertial\n\nvelocity vector V of the origin of the reference frame. The reference frame is\n\ndepicted in Fig. 6.3. The unit vectors in radial (eR), tangential/along-track (eT),\n\nand normal/cross-track (eN) directions are computed as\n\neR \u00bc R\nRk k ; eT \u00bc eN ? eR ; eN \u00bc\n\nR? V\nR? Vk k : (6.12)\n\nIn this subsection, two linearized relative dynamics models for the relative\n\nmotion of two objects orbiting the same primary body are introduced. Both models\n\nassume unperturbed, i.e., Keplerian, relative motion, a small distance between the\n\n236 D.

For the angular parameters, the\n\ncarrier phase measurements need to be differenced between receiving antennas\n\non the same satellite. A major complication here is that the measured phase\n\ndifferences represent a combination of geometry (the desired LOS of the remote\n\ntransmitter) and instrumental offsets, including an integer-cycle ambiguity. As long\n\nas the geometry remains fixed, the two contributions are indistinguishable and the\n\nLOS indeterminate. In order to separate the two components of differenced phase,\n\ntwo integer ambiguity resolution (IAR) methods can be used and will be detailed in\n\nthe following. The first method effectively adds extra information in the ranging\n\nsignal which allows resolution of the integer ambiguities while the second method\n\nrelies on a relative geometry change to separate the two contributions.\n\nThe first IAR method uses multiple signals with different frequencies, which\n\nallows the construction of artificial phase measurements by linearly combining the\n\nphase measurements of the individual signals. The goal here is to form multiple\n\n(if possible) so-called wide-lane signals, whose wavelength, lWL, is much longer\nthan that of the original signals. The integer ambiguity on these long wavelength\n\nsignals is much easier to resolve than for the shorter wavelength signals. Thus, if we\n\nuse ranging signals S1 and S2 with frequencies fS1 \u00bc 2.25 GHz (lS1 \u00bc 13.3 cm)\nand fS2 \u00bc 2.1 GHz (lS2 \u00bc 14.3 cm) and with phase measurements \u2019S1 and \u2019S2\nrespectively, the resulting wide-lane wavelength lWL and the wide-lane phase\nmeasurement \u2019WL are\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 239\n\n\n\n\u2019WL \u00bc m1\u2019S1 ? m2\u2019S2\nlWL \u00bc c\n\nm1fS1 ? m2fS2\n(6.18)\n\nwith m1; m2 2 N . Choosing m1 \u00bc m2 \u00bc 1 results in lWL \u00bc 2 m >> lS1, lS2.\nHaving two frequencies S1 and S2 allows the formation of two linearly independent\n\nwide-lane combinations WL1 and WL2 of S1 and S2. Using also a third frequency\n\nS3 increases the number of possible linearly independent wide-lane combinations\n\nto three. In addition, since the accuracy of the wide-lane measurement sWL scales as\nsWL \u00bc ((m1sS1)2 + (m2sS2)2 + . . . + (mNsSN)2)\u00bd, the magnitude of m should\ngenerally be kept small [11].\n\nBy now choosing the frequencies of the ranging signals in such a way that the\n\nwavelength of the different wide-lane combinations gradually reduces (lWL1 >\nlWL2 > . . . > lS), the integer ambiguity on the carrier phase of ranging signal S\ncan be resolved in a cascaded approach. For example, assuming we want to remove\n\nthe carrier phase integer ambiguity on a distance measurement, the process starts, if\n\nnecessary, with smoothing the unambiguous but relatively inaccurate code-based\n\npseudorange measurement with the much more accurate carrier phase measure-\n\nments using a sufficiently long averaging time. When the accuracy of the smoothed\n\npseudorange, sr,smoothed, is better than half the wavelength of the wide-lane signal\nwith the longest wavelength, i.e. sr,smoothed < \u00bdlWL1, the ambiguity on this wide-\nlane signal can be resolved with high confidence. This unambiguous wide-lane\n\nsignal is subsequently treated as a pseudorange measurement and smoothed using\n\ncarrier phase measurements until its accuracy is better than half the wavelength of\n\nthe next wide-lane signal (sWL1,smoothed < \u00bdlWL2). This cascaded process\ncontinues all the way up to the carrier phase of the transmitted signal.\n\nWhen choosing the signal frequencies to be used by the relative navigation\n\nsystem, a proper balance needs to be found between the magnitude of lWL and the\ndifference between lWL and lS: A relatively large magnitude for lWL results in\nhigher confidence for the IAR performed on the wide-lane, but results in a large\n\ndifference between lWL and lS, which makes it hard to resolve the ambiguity on\nsignal S with high confidence. The system design is further constrained by the\n\nfrequencies that are allowed to be used for this application, to be discussed in\n\nSect. 6.3.1.1, and by the increase in system complexity when the number of used\n\nsignal frequencies is increased.\n\nAn example of an RF-based relative navigation sensor that applies this maneuver-\n\nfree principle is the Autonomous Formation Flying (AFF) sensor, which utilizes a\n\nspecial \u201cultra-BOC\u201d (Binary Offset Carrier) signal, cf. Fig. 6.4. The signal consists\n\nout of a central carrier that is modulated with a ranging code, two inner tones that are\n\nslowlymodulated with data, and two unmodulated outer tones. First the pseudorange\n\nis determined using code measurements with accuracy of ~0.5 m. Then the closely\n\nspaced tones on one side of the carrier frequency are used to form awide-lane (WL1)\n\nwith 7.5 m wavelength. The code measurements can now be used to solve the\n\nambiguity on this wide-lane. Now a second wide-lane (WL2) of 1 m wavelength\n\n240 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nis formed using the two outermost tones. The unambiguous WL1 is now used to\n\nsolve the ambiguity on WL2. In the last step, the unambiguous WL2 is used\n\nto resolve the phase ambiguity at the carrier phase itself [12].\n\nThe second method makes use of the fact that a precisely known change in the\n\nrelative geometry should result in a predictable change in the measurements. Since\n\nmultipath-induced bias and antenna phase center location are a function of the LOS,\n\nthe geometry change is best not effected through a change in the LOS but through a\n\nreal or apparent change in the inter-satellite distance along the LOS vector. An\n\napparent change in the inter-satellite distance can be achieved by rotating the\n\nsatellite around the boresight of the transmitting antenna in case of a circularly\n\npolarized signal. The change in the measured carrier phase will be different for\n\ndifferent receiving antennas and is a function of the LOS. This allows removal of\n\nsome candidates from the integer search space and selection of the correct integer\n\nfor the LOS.\n\nNaturally, IAR is preferably performed using a maneuver-free approach since\n\nmaneuvers require precious time (usually minutes), energy, and need to be repeated\n\nwhenever a receiver loses lock on a signal. This is still manageable for a small\n\nformation consisting out of just a few satellites, but not for formations consisting\n\nout of tens of satellites. The Formation Flying Radio Frequency (FFRF) instrument,\n\nwhich can support formations consisting of up to four satellites, uses a mixed\n\napproach: It uses two separate signals which can be used to form a wide-lane\n\nand thus allows for a cascaded approach. However, due to multipath biases, this\n\nstrategy will not always result in high enough confidence levels to assure a correct\n\nIAR. Therefore, it initiates the IAR procedure using a satellite rotation to first solve\n\nthe ambiguity on the LOS. The exact procedure for the FFRF is outlined in Sect. 6.4.2.\n\nfc-\n150 MHz\n\nfc+\n150 MHz\n\nfc-\n110 MHz\n\n& 100 bits/s\n\nfc+\n110 MHz\n\n& 100 bits/s\n\nBPSK ranging code, 10 Mch/sStep 3\n\nStep 2 Step 1\n\nStep 3\n\nStep 2\n\nStep 1\n\nObservable Formation\n\nfc\n\nAcquisition\n\nFig. 6.4 Ultra-BOC signal structure and processing steps [12]\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 241\n\n\n\nAs a final note, IAR is widely recognized to be one of the most challenging\n\naspects of highly accurate RF-based relative navigation, which is mainly due to\n\nthe presence of various measurement biases, of which signal multipath is perhaps\n\nthe most problematic. For example, differencing carrier phase measurements\n\nbetween antennas removes correlated noise sources (e.g., clock errors, ionospheric\n\nrefraction effects) but amplifies uncorrelated noise sources (e.g., multipath).\n\nIn addition, without careful design and calibration, instrumental biases can be\n\ndifferent between antennas, resulting in a residual bias even after differencing\n\nmeasurements between antennas.\n\n6.2.2.4 Estimation\n\nReal time estimation of the relative states is typically performed using a reduced\n\ndynamics approach, which uses the highly precise measurements together with a\n\ndynamical model which is augmented with to-be-estimated empirical accelerations\n\nto cope with the imperfections of the dynamic model. A sequential filter such\n\nas an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) performs relative and/or absolute orbit\n\ndetermination and prediction using the (smoothed) code and carrier measurements\n\nfrom both satellites. As there is a wealth of information on the general implementa-\n\ntion of an EKF in the literature, the algorithms involved will not be discussed here.\n\nNote that in case of dual one-way ranging, the dual one-way measurements will be\n\nonly available to the filter some time after the actual one-way measurement took\n\nplace since the measurement data needs to be transmitted between the satellites.\n\nThus, for real time onboard implementation, this needs to be accounted for in the filter\n\ninnovation: The delayed measurements must be propagated to the time reference\n\nused by the EKF, taking into account relative dynamics if high accuracy is needed.\n\nIn case only inter-satellite range measurements are used as inputs for the EKF,\n\nthe relative orbit estimation is hampered by the following issue: If a relative\n\ndynamics model is used in the estimator (e.g., CW, YA), the relative states are\n\nexpressed in a local orbital frame, for which commonly the Hill frame is adopted.\n\nTo enable conversion of the measured ranges and angles from the body frame to the\n\nHill frame, the orientation of the satellite with respect to the Hill frame has to be\n\nknown. Therefore, not only the satellite attitude, but also the orientation of the Hill\n\nframe has to be known on board. The latter can only be known when the absolute\n\norbit of at least one of the satellites is known since the orientation of the Hill frame\n\nis a function of the absolute orbital parameters. This information can in principle be\n\ndetermined by the satellites themselves, but requires, in absence of GNSS\n\nmeasurements, a high-fidelity dynamic model and a specific attitude sensor suite.\n\nTherefore, it can be more practical to upload this information from ground.\n\nThe estimation of the relative states can be done centrally or distributed,\n\ndepending on the number of satellites in the formation and the desired accuracy:\n\nIf all measurements are collected and processed centrally in one large filter, the\n\nresult will be more accurate than when many local solutions are computed which\n\nare based on limited information. Drawback of the centralized approach is that the\n\n242 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nsatellite which runs the filter requires a large amount of processing power\n\n(since matrix operations such as multiplication and inversion scale with the third\n\npower of the number of states to be estimated) and needs to be able to communicate\n\nwith all other satellites in a timely fashion for command and control dissemination.\n\nIn addition, in the centralized approach, if only one satellite is capable of\n\nperforming the relative state estimation for the entire formation, this satellite\n\nrepresents a single point of failure for the formation and thus for the mission.\n\nThis can be overcome by designing multiple satellites such that they can assume\n\nthe role of \u2018leader\u2019, but comes at the cost of increased complexity of these satellites.\n\n6.3 System Design Considerations\n\nRelative navigation using RF signals imposes various design challenges and\n\nconsiderations on the complete formation system design. These are addressed on\n\nsignal level and hardware level.\n\n6.3.1 Signal Level Design Considerations\n\nAs the inter-satellite links between the satellites in the formation must enable both\n\nranging and communication to allow relative navigation to be performed, it makes\n\nsense to combine these two functions in a single signal as this provides spectral\n\nefficiency and reduced satellite complexity. This subsection deals with the available\n\nfrequencies for the signal, multiple access considerations, ranging signal design,\n\nand data modulation. It is noted that networking protocols are considered to be out\n\nof the scope of the current discussion.\n\n6.3.1.1 Available Frequencies\n\nRF frequency bands are regulated by the International Telecommunication Union\n\n(ITU). Table 6.1 lists the frequency bands between 1 and 100 GHz that are\n\nrecommended for use in RF-based inter-satellite crosslinks. Frequency selection\n\nis also affected by the frequency used for the Telemetry, Tracking and Command\n\n(TT&C) subsystem. Additional filtering can be required when these frequencies do\n\nnot have sufficient spectral separation. It is noted that the Ultra-High Frequency\n\n(UHF) band, due to its low propagation loss, is an interesting option for inter-\n\nsatellite ranging if there are no high accuracy requirements, but requires regulatory\n\nchanges to be put into effect to obtain the necessary frequency allocations.\n\nConversely, higher frequency bands allow for higher ranging accuracy and lower\n\nmultipath error, but require more transmitter power to compensate for increased\n\nfree space loss, reduced effective C/N0, and ultimately make the overall communi-\ncation system more complex.\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 243\n\n\n\n6.3.1.2 Multiple Access\n\nAccurate inter-satellite ranging requires the use of multiple access technologies to\n\nprevent mutual interference. The basic forms of multiple access are Frequency\n\nDivision Multiple Access (FDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and\n\nTime Division Multiple Access (TDMA). Hybrid forms of these can also be\n\nemployed. Usage of FDMA and CDMA allows transmission and reception of\n\nranging signals by multiple platforms at the same time, thereby preventing the\n\nneed for scheduling as required when using TDMA. Downside is the potential for\n\nnear-far interference which occurs when a high power signal transmitted by a\n\nplatform close by completely drowns the signal transmitted by a platform far\n\naway. This problem is especially severe when the high power signal is produced\n\nby the receiving platform itself, which is known as self-interference, and is difficult\n\nto remove completely using hardware solutions (filtering, internal loop). FDMA is\n\nfurthermore hampered by the need for a very wide frequency bandwidth for the\n\nentire formation in case the formation consists out of many satellites, complicating\n\nhardware design and ITU frequency filing.\n\nThe usage of TDMAwill not lead to near-far interference problems, but it can be\n\ninefficient in case of highly varying separation distances between the platforms.\n\nIn that case, the guard bands between different time slots must be large enough to\n\nprevent signals transmitted by far away platforms arriving after a nearby platform\n\nhas started transmitting in its time slot. Then, there can be a large time interval\n\nbetween the dual one-way range measurements between two platforms, resulting in\n\na relatively large clock drift and thus inaccurate results. In addition, to prevent\n\nconstantly needing to reacquire a signal, the receiver needs to flywheel a certain\n\nchannel in case the transmitter assigned to that channel is silent. However, when\n\nflywheeling is applied, if the TDMA duty cycle is too long, the clock will drift out\n\nof the delay lock loop (DLL) capture range, and signal reacquisition will need to be\n\nperformed unless data is provided that allows dynamic compensation of the\n\ntracking loop [14]. The greatest challenge of TDMA is time synchronization with\n\na maximum synchronization error that is equal to the propagation time of the\n\nranging signal (e.g. smaller than 10 ms when the separation distance is less than\n3 km). The usage of TDMA for multiple access is generally preferred for small\n\nformations (2\u20134 satellites) since it requires the least complicated hardware.\n\nReference [12] presented variations on the traditional TDMA scheme which are\n\ndeliberately non-synchronized, but still guarantee that all satellites receive each of\n\nTable 6.1 Recommended frequencies for RF-based inter-satellite crosslinks [12, 13]\n\nBand S Ku Ka W\n\nFrequency range (GHz) 2.025\u20132.110 13.75\u201314.3 22.55\u201323.55 59\u201364\n\n25.25\u201327.5\n\n2.200\u20132.290 14.5\u201315.35 32.3\u201333.4 65\u201371\n\n244 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nthe others equally after a long period of time. These schemes remove the need for\n\nsynchronization, but suffer from near-far interference (although self-interference is\n\nruled out).\n\nHybrid forms of multiple access start to become attractive once the number of\n\nsatellites in the formation gets larger than about five. A popular approach then\n\napplied is a combination of FDMA and CDMA [15]. The satellites within small\n\nsub-clusters in the formation then use the same frequency for their ranging signals\n\nand achieve spectral separation by means of CDMA. Spectral separation between\n\nthe sub-clusters is achieved by means of FDMA. The choice of multiple access\n\ntechnology is also driven by the mission need. Sometimes half-duplex (TDMA) is\n\nsufficient, but full-duplex can be required for challenging missions.\n\n6.3.1.3 Ranging Signal Design\n\nRF-based inter-satellite ranging typically relies on a signal modulation technique\n\ncalled Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), which is also used for GNSS\n\nsignals. Therefore, ranging signal design for formation flying satellites benefits\n\ntremendously from the work done in this field. DSSS uses a periodic high rate\n\nPseudo-Random Noise (PRN) waveform to spread a low rate data signal modulated\n\non a carrier wave over a wider bandwidth, reducing the effect of interference from\n\nother signals and allowing signal acquisition even when the signal power is well\n\nbelow the noise floor. The PRNwaveform can be used for coarse rangemeasurements\n\nby correlating a locally generated replica with the received PRNwaveform. The finite\n\nsequence of bits used to generate the PRNwaveformover one period is referred to as a\n\nPRN sequence or code. Assigning each transmitter with its own PRN code and using\nPRN codes with low cross-correlation properties allows unambiguous identification\n\nof the transmitter at the receiver and CDMA-based operation.\n\nRanging by means of a DSSS ranging signal occurs in two steps. First, a coarse\n\ntwo-dimensional search over frequency and time is performed over the entire PRN\n\ncode length, with steps of one code chip, and a representative frequency range, also\n\nwith fixed steps, to find the ranging signal by means of correlation with the local\n\nreplica. Once the signal has been acquired, the tracking phase starts in which a DLL\n\nis used to maintain lock onto the signal and to obtain an accurate measurement of\n\nthe code phase, also by means of correlation, and a phase lock loop (PLL) is used to\n\nmeasure the carrier phase and to aid the DLL. The PLL does this by forming a phase\n\nvector of inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the signal. Due to the\n\npresence of data bits in the signal, of which the sequence is not known a priori, a\n\nCostas PLL loop has to be used to extract the data contained in the signal.\n\nFor code ranging, the phase measurement discussed in Sect. 6.2.1.2 can be made\n\nunambiguous by providing information on the time of transmission of the code. This\n\nis done by means of the data signal modulated on the same carrier. Therefore, code\n\nphase measurements can be treated as time delay measurements. New GNSS signals\n\nhave one signal component containing a PRN code and data (data component) and\n\none signal component with only a PRN code (pilot component). The latter allows for\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 245\n\n\n\nlonger integration times and therefore higher ranging accuracy. Typically, both\n\ncomponents are assigned equal power levels in the combined signal.\n\nThe minimum time interval between transitions in the PRN waveform is known\n\nas the chip period Tc, the portion of the PRN waveform is referred to as a chip or\nspreading symbol and the reciprocal of the chip period is known as the chipping\nrate fc. The traditional modulation used for the chips is Binary Phase Shift\nKeying (BPSK), often referred to as BPSK-R due to the rectangular shape of the\n\nspreading symbols. In recent years, BOC signals and their derivatives (alternate\n\nBOC (altBOC), Composite BOC (CBOC), Multiplexed BOC (MBOC)), have made\n\ntheir way to implementation on GNSS systems like Galileo and modernized GPS,\n\nbut not yet to inter-satellite ranging. A BOC(m, n) signal is created by modulating a\nsine wave carrier with the product of a PRN spreading code and a square wave\n\nsubcarrier having each binary ?1 values. The parameter m stands for the ratio\nbetween the subcarrier frequency and the reference frequency, usually 1.023 MHz,\n\nand n stands for the ratio between the code rate and the reference frequency. Thus,\nBOC(10, 5) means a 10.23 MHz subcarrier frequency and a 5.115 MHz code rate.\n\nFor ranging signals, chip pulse design is limited by practical hardware\n\nlimitations. Since the ranging accuracy depends on the ability of the hardware to\n\nfaithfully reproduce the spreading waveform, the use of signals that can be\n\ngenerated using simple digital means is highly preferred. Spreading symbol shapes\n\nunder consideration for future implementation are Binary Coded Symbols (BCS),\n\nMultilevel Coded Spreading Symbols (MCS), Composite BPSK (CBPSK),\n\nSinusoidal Offset Carrier (SOC) signals, and Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions\n\n(PSWF) [16]. Figure 6.5 depicts the principles of BPSK-R and BOC modulation.\n\nThe chipping rate of a ranging signal influences the ranging accuracy in that a\n\nhigher chipping rate results in more accurate code ranging for the same pulse shape\n\ndue to a sharper autocorrelation peak, cf. Fig. 6.6. This comes at the price of larger\n\nsignal bandwidth. The pulse shape also affects the autocorrelation function.\n\nFigure 6.6 shows that BOC(1,1) has a much sharper correlation peak than the\n\nFig. 6.5 DSSS modulation using BPSK-R (a) and BOC (b) (in (a), \u201cC\u201d is code and \u201cD\u201d is data\n\nand in (b), navigation data is not shown) [17] (With kind permission from Springer Science +\n\nBusiness Media B.V.)\n\n246 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nGPS C/A code, which uses a rectangular pulse, even though their chipping rate is\n\nthe same. However, the correlation function of BOC signals has side extremes that\n\nare not present for rectangular pulses, negatively influencing their acquisition and\n\ntracking robustness since the receiver can potentially lock onto the wrong peak in\n\ncase of for instance significant multipath.\n\nUsing the Crame?r-Rao lower bound theory, it can be proven [18, 19] that for the\n\nbest code ranging accuracy the signal energy should be concentrated as much as\n\npossible at the band edge of the signal This way, a gain (or actually a decrease) of\n\nseveral dB can be obtained in the required carrier to noise ratio (C/N0) for a desired\ncode ranging accuracy [18]. In that respect, out of the presently used chip pulse\n\nshapes, BOC modulation is inherently better than BPSK-R modulation. However,\n\ntracking and acquisition robustness must also be considered, which means that the\n\namplitude of the side extremes of the autocorrelation function must be limited as\n\nmuch as possible. There, BPSK-R has a distinct advantage over BOC. Band\n\nlimiting of the signal and spectral separation can also be important parameters for\n\nformation flying ranging signal design, but this depends greatly on the multiple\n\naccess technology used in the formation. For instance, if FDMA is used, band\n\nlimiting is of crucial importance to avoid large guard bands or complex filter\n\ndesigns, but when TDMA is used, this is of much less concern.\n\nMultipath is an important performance limitation for current designs.\n\nImportant parameters in this respect are the multipath-to-direct signal power\n\nratio, the multipath carrier phase difference with the direct path, the multipath\n\ndelay, and the signal frequency. The detrimental effects of multipath are best\n\nmitigated using small correlator spacing, large precorrelation bandwidths (to cap-\n\nture as much of the signal energy as possible) and a high code chipping rate (sharp\n\ncorrelation peak). For satellites, multipath delay is caused by the satellite structure\n\nand since the satellite dimensions are on the order of meters at most, the multipath\n\ndelay is in the order of nanoseconds. Unfortunately, in that region, code and carrier\n\nmultipath error is practically similar for different pulse shapes and chipping rates,\n\n\u201320 \u201315 \u201310 \u20135 0 5 10 15 20\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201310\n\n\u20135\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFrequency [MHz]\n\nP\now\n\ner\n s\n\npe\nct\n\nra\nl d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n [d\n\nB\n/H\n\nz] C/A code\nBOC(1,1)\nP code\nBOC(10,5)\n\n\u20132 \u20131.5 \u20131 \u20130.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\n\u20131\n\n\u20130.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nDelay [ms]\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n a\nut\n\no?\nco\n\nrr\nel\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n[?\n\n] C/A code\nBOC(1,1)\nP code\nBOC(10,5)\n\nFig. 6.6 Normalized auto-correlation and amplitude spectrum properties of the GPS C/A, GPS P\n\n(Y), BOC(1,1) and BOC(2,1) code\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 247\n\n\n\nso a different signal design will hardly alleviate this problem. Current practice for\n\nmultipath mitigation in space is calibration and will be detailed in Sect. 6.4.3.\n\nThe PRN code is, as the name suggests, a code designed mimic white noise but\n\nwhich is actually deterministic. The most famous example is the set of codes\n\ndevised by Gold [20] which are used in the GPS C/A codes. There, the Gold\n\ncodes have a length of 1,023 chips and have very good cross-correlation properties,\n\nmaking it possible to track multiple codes transmitted at the same time and with\n\ncomparable C/N0. Longer codes will approximate white noise better and will thus\nexhibit better cross-correlation properties. On the other hand, shorter codes lend\n\nthemselves well for rapid acquisition since a smaller search space has to be covered.\n\nIt is for that reason that GPS uses the short C/A code, which was initially not\n\nintended to be used for actual positioning, and the long P-code. This strategy is also\n\napplied in the Star Ranger instrument [21]. Downside of this strategy is that a\n\nrelatively long search has to be done over time to acquire the longer code. To reduce\n\nthis search time, so-called tiered codes have been developed. There, a primary code\n\nis modulated with a short secondary code, resulting in a long combined code,\n\nallowing the user to first quickly acquire the short primary code and then quickly\n\nswitch to tracking of the long code. Some PRN code examples are Maximum\n\nLength Sequences (MLS, they form the basis for most of the codes used nowadays\n\nfor GNSS), Kasami codes, Weil codes, and Random Memory codes [22].\n\n6.3.1.4 Data Modulation and Bit Errors\n\nAutonomous1 formation flying requires the distribution of data between the\n\nsatellites in the formation. Navigation data such as relative distance, velocity,\n\nattitude, and time information is essential for formation control purposes.\n\nEngineering data such as satellite health should also be exchanged to enable fault\n\ndetection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Even science data can potentially be\n\ndistributed between satellites if for instance a star topology is used in which one\n\nmaster satellite transmits all science data to the ground. The volume and transmis-\n\nsion frequency of the navigation data is tightly coupled to the nature of the mission.\n\nIn case of tightly cooperating satellites in close formations (separation distances\n\n<1 km) with high positioning accuracy and tight control windows, the frequency of\nbroadcast of navigation data can be on the order of seconds or even continuously\n\n[23]. Data rates can vary from kbit/s for missions with rather relaxed requirements\n\nto Mbit/s for challenging missions with a distributed control architecture.\n\nTraditionally, this data is modulated on top of the PRN code using BPSK. Then,\n\nthe achievable data rate is limited since the width of a data bit cannot be smaller\n\n1 In this chapter, \u201cautonomous\u201d implies that all the information which the system (the formation)\n\nrequires for the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of the relative state of the satellites in the\n\nformation is obtained internally in the system itself. Thus, external information (e.g., GNSS\n\nmeasurements, telecommands) is not required for GNC of the formation.\n\n248 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nthan the code period because this would lead to failure of the acquisition process. In\n\naddition, acquisition is made easier when the data bits are at least several code\n\nperiods wide since this allows for longer integration times and thus higher C/N0.\nHowever, when separate data and pilot channels are used, this argument no longer\n\nholds. It is noted that the FFRF instrument performs data modulation differently\n\nthan traditional GNSS signals as it uses quadrature PSK (QPSK) modulation for one\n\nof its two ranging signals. There, it modulates the PRN code on the inphase channel\n\nand the navigation and engineering data on the quadrature channel, thereby some-\n\nwhat removing the constraint on the width of a data bit (which is still limited by the\n\ndata demodulation capability of the digital hardware) [13].\n\nNaturally, the transmitted data should be partitioned into frames and subframes\n\nof known length in order for the receiver to be able to recover the information.\n\nA preamble with a fixed sequence of zeroes and ones should be implemented to\n\nallow frame synchronization using a bit parity check and to solve the inherent 180\t\n\nphase ambiguity of the Costas PLL. The subframe length, the data contained in each\n\nsubframe, and the ordering of the subframes depend on many considerations and\n\nare considered to be out of scope. Data that can potentially be subdivided into\n\nseparate subframes can be timing data, measurement data, absolute position and/or\n\nattitude data, spacecraft health, commands, and possibly payload data. To reduce\n\nthe required transmission power but still achieve low bit error rate (BER) the data\n\ncan be coded, for instance using convolutional coding.\n\nNext to these considerations, it is beneficial when the signal transmitted from the\n\nsatellite has a constant power envelope, i.e., the total transmitted power does not\n\nvary over time. Thus, the transmitted information is not contained in the signal\n\namplitude and the transmitted signal amplitude becomes less critical. This is a very\n\ndesirable property of the signal since it allows the use of efficient \u201cclass C\u201d-like\n\npower amplifiers [17].\n\n6.3.2 Hardware Level Design Considerations\n\nApplication of an RF-based relative navigation system on a satellite places specific\n\ndemands on the hardware used on the satellite. Naturally, there are requirements on\n\nthe hardware for the relative navigation system itself, but also the satellite design is\n\naffected. In addition, the accuracy of the signal generation and processing depends\n\non the quality of the on-board clock. All these aspects will be explored in the next\n\nsubsections.\n\n6.3.2.1 Satellite Design\n\nThe RF-based relative navigation systemwill impact the satellite designmainly with\n\nrespect to its layout. Protruding elements that are not part of the relative navigation\n\nsystem, e.g. solar panels and TTC antennas, should preferably be positioned such\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 249\n\n\n\nthat multipath and RF interference contributions from these elements is reduced to a\n\nminimum. If a high level of onboard autonomy is required, the antennas of the\n\nrelative navigation system itself should be mounted such that a 4p steradian field of\nview is obtained. This is mainly required to enable safe transition from a \u2018lost in\n\nspace\u2019 configuration, where the relative positions of the satellites are unknown, to\n\nformation acquisition and finally formationmaintenance. However, this can result in\n\na very large amount of antennas needed: For the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF)\n\nmission, the antenna layout was complicated due to an unusual satellite shape\n\ncaused by a large thermal shield, resulting in a total of 16 antennas on each\n\nsatellite [12].\n\nA trade-off has to be made between antenna beamwidth (i.e., antenna gain) and\n\nthe total number of antennas: To reduce the influence of multipath for receiver\n\nantennas and to reduce the required transmission power for transmitting antennas,\n\nthe antenna beam should be narrow (high gain). However, this increases the total\n\nnumber of antennas needed for full sky coverage. Purcell et al. [6] arrived at a\n\ncircular beam with roughly constant gain out to 45\t or 50\t off axis and a sharp\ndrop-off at larger angles. This result can be understood since in a formation, the\n\nsatellites are commonly facing each other in a specific manner and the layout of\n\nthe metrology system is tailored to that. Thus, the highest accuracy and therefore\n\nhighest C/N0 is usually required in a prescribed direction with little deviation from\nthat direction. If one of the companion satellites is not in its desired position, the\n\nformation has not been acquired yet or has been lost. Then, the location and heading\n\nof the \u2018rogue\u2019 satellite does not need to be known with the highest accuracy\n\npossible, since the satellites are not in the desired configuration, and thus some\n\nloss in C/N0 is tolerable.\nLast but not least, the satellite platform should provide a mechanically and\n\nthermally stable environment to enable the most accurate measurements. This is\n\nput to the extreme in the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)\n\nmission where the entire satellite design is driven by the need for micrometer-level\n\naccuracy (~10?4 cycle) in the carrier phase measurements [24].\n\n6.3.2.2 Transceiver Design\n\nThe \u2018heart\u2019 of the RF-based relative navigation system is the transceiver. There, the\n\nRF signals are generated to be transmitted and received RF signals are processed.\n\nA frequency standard, the local oscillator, and frequency synthesizers generate the\n\nhigh and low frequency signals needed to generate and process the desired RF\n\nsignals. The receiver part consists out of an RF front-end where the received signals\n\nare filtered, down converted and digitized and a digital signal processor (DSP)\n\nwhere code and phase measurements are extracted from the digitized data.\n\nThe transmitter part generates and modulates the PRN code and the data in\n\nbaseband, modulates this onto a high frequency carrier in the front-end, and passes\n\nthis through a power amplifier and finally an antenna. A complication in the\n\ntransceiver design is that for each transmitting chain, the transmitted carrier and\n\n250 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\ncode phases are required to be coherent (to enable carrier-aided smoothing of the\n\ncode measurements). Similarly, for each receiving chain, the local oscillator signal\n\nand the receiving channel digital clock are required to be coherent as well.\n\nDepending on the level of system integration, the transceiver can also contain a\n\nprocessing part that can handle various tasks such as relative state estimation and\n\ntransmission power control. If the level of system integration is high, most if not all\n\nhigh-level processing needed for the relative navigation will be performed by the\n\nsatellite\u2019s Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system. An example of a\n\ntransceiver design is depicted in Fig. 6.7. This particular design is used to generate\n\nand receive the \u201cultra-BOC\u201d signal discussed earlier.\n\nThe DSP can be implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA),\n\nwhich is relatively cheap and allows for a high level of modification in orbit, or an\n\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), which has higher performance than\n\nan FPGA, but is more expensive. Traditionally, ASICs were the preferred option,\n\nbut present day there are commercially available radiation-tolerant high-density\n\nFPGAs that can rival ASICs in terms of performance.\n\nWhen there are many satellites in the formation and if the multiple access\n\ntechnique chosen for the formation allows for it, adaptive power control can be\n\nTx = Transmitter RTC = Real Time Clock PN = Pseudorandom Noise\n\nRx = Receiver A/D = Analog-to-Digital AMP = Amplifier\n\nBPF = Band Pass Filter SW = Saw Filter LNA = Low Noise Amplifier\n\nNCO = Numerically Controlled Oscillator\n\nFig. 6.7 Block diagram for the Acquisition Sensor of the TPF mission (After [12])\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 251\n\n\n\napplied at the transmitter to minimize power consumption. Since the formation will\n\nbe designed such that the ranging accuracy and data BER between the two most\n\nseparated platforms meets the requirements, the C/N0 between all the other\nplatforms will be higher than required and thus inefficient. AsC/N0 can be measured\nby the receiver and relayed to the transmitter, the transmitter can, by propagating the\n\nexpected relative motion forward in time, predict which output power should be\n\nproduced to achieve the desired C/N0 with the least amount of power. However,\ndepending on the amount of power control, it is necessary to dynamically adapt the\n\ncode and phase tracking loops. This is a result of varying signal power that is\n\nreceived and variations in the data rate requirements. Even with power control,\n\ninitialization of the power control method and initial signal acquisition requires the\n\nability to adapt the signal acquisition loops to the received power level. In addition,\n\ndue to inherent transmitter inefficiencies, significant power savings can be achieved\n\nby transmitting at the minimum required power level [15]. Often, there is simply a\n\nlow and a high power setting available.\n\nInternal calibration is needed to compensate for biases resulting from satellite\n\nthermal, electrical, and mechanical variations. This can be achieved by feeding\n\nsome of the transmitted signal to the receiver to construct an artificial range\n\nmeasurement which consists out of the hardware delays only. This measurement\n\nis then subtracted from the true range measurement to remove the hardware-\n\ninduced delays. This can be seen in Fig. 6.7, where some of the transmitted signal\n\nis attenuated and fed to the receiver. Note that the frequencies of the self-generated\n\nsignal and of the received signal should be similar since then the instrumental\n\neffects on the two signals are the same and thus the self-calibration will lead to the\n\nbest result.\n\nIf all satellites are transmitting and receiving at the same time, part of the signal\n\ntransmitted by a satellite will inevitably leak into the receiver on the same satellite\n\nand potentially saturate the receiver front-end or overwhelm the other signals.\n\nTwo remedies are available to deal with this without resorting to TDMA [6]:\n\n\u2022 Frequency separation: All satellites transmit at widely spaced frequencies such\nthat an appropriate filter can reject most of the self-signal.\n\n\u2022 Active rejection: The received signal is correlated against a replica of the\nself-signal. The result is used to control the amplitude and phase of an \u201canti-self\u201d\n\ncomponent, added to the received signal, which effectively cancels the unwanted\n\ninput. This complicates the receiver, but is very effective.\n\nThe design of the relative navigation system should allow for on-orbit\n\nre-calibration to account for different multipath environment, different antenna\n\nphase patterns, instabilities (thermal, electrical, mechanical) of the satellite, etc.\n\nThus, if a multipath correction table, generated via on-ground calibration, is stored\n\nonboard and used to correct measurements, it should be possible to update it after\n\nin-orbit re-calibration. In addition, the design should be scalable to meet the\n\ndemands of various missions and to provide cost-effectiveness.\n\n252 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\n6.3.2.3 Clock Stability\n\nAs already mentioned in Sect. 6.2.1.2, the stability of the onboard clock is an\n\nimportant parameter if very accurate navigation solutions are required. It also\n\nprovides time to the rest of the satellite using pulse-per-second (PPS) signals.\n\nDue to clock drift, the frequency of the PPS will also drift over time. Note that if\n\nthere are very stringent requirements on the absolute time reference used by the\n\nsatellites, the maximum error in the PPS can be a more stringent requirement for\n\ntheclock stability than what is asked for by the ranging system. The short-term\n\nstability of the oscillator is not only important to limit the relative clock drift during\n\nsignal travel time, but also to guarantee good PLL tracking characteristics for small\n\nPLL noise bandwidths, which is a necessary condition for reducing the thermal\n\nnoise error [25].\n\nQuartz crystal oscillators (XOs) are nowadays the standard for onboard time\n\nkeeping on non-GNSS satellites and this discussion will therefore be limited to this\n\ntype of clock only. The stability of a frequency source can be described by starting\n\nwith an oscillator whose output voltage V(t) is given by [25]\n\nV\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc V0 \u00fe eV\u00f0t\u00de\u00f0 \u00de sin 2pf0t\u00fe d\u2019\u00f0t\u00de\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de (6.19)\n\nwhere V0 and f0 are the nominal amplitude and frequency, respectively, with\ncorresponding errors eV(t) and d\u2019(t). The argument of the sine function in (6.19)\nis equal to the instantaneous phase \u2019(t). The amplitude error for the output voltage\nis in practice not an issue since this can be mitigated using an amplitude limiter.\n\nThe clock frequency can be modeled as [26]\n\nf \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc f0 \u00fe Df \u00fe t? t0\u00f0 \u00de _f \u00fe ~f \u00f0t\u00de (6.20)\n\nwhere f0 is the nominal frequency, Df is the frequency bias or offset, _f is the\nfrequency drift, ~f is the random frequency error, and t0 is the reference epoch.\nThe time error in this clock at time t1 (disregarding sign) is\n\nDt t1\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Dt t0\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Df\nf0\n\nt1 ? t0\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe\n_f\n\n2f0\nt1 ? t0\u00f0 \u00de2 \u00fe\n\nZt1\nt0\n\n~f \u00f0t\u00de\nf0\n\ndt: (6.21)\n\nDifferencing (6.21) between two free running clocks provides us with the\n\nrelative time error at time t1. Dual one-way ranging using range and Doppler\nmeasurements allows for the measurement of the constant and linear term in this\n\nequation. The first three terms in (6.21) represent systematic effects while the last\n\nterm represents random frequency fluctuations, the size of which depends upon\n\nenvironmental effects and ageing. They are characterized by their variance and\n\nauto-correlation function. The Allan variance is a commonly used measure of the\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 253\n\n\n\ntimekeeping ability of a clock with respect to random processes. The Allan variance\n\nis defined as\n\ns2y t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\n1\n\n2\nyi\u00fe1 ? yi\u00f0 \u00de2\n\nD E\n(6.22)\n\nwhere yi is a measurement of relative frequency deviation (y \u00bc Df/f0) of an\noscillator averaged over the period t, (yi+1 \u2013 yi) are the differences between pairs\nof successive measurements of y, and, ideally, ?h i denotes a time average of an\ninfinite number of (yi+1 \u2013 yi)\n\n2. The nature of the random process associated with the\n\nmeasurements of relative frequency deviations changes with the size of the\n\naveraging interval t and the Allan variance converges for all of them. The square\nroot of the Allan variance is called the Allan deviation sy(t). The r.m.s. error of a\nclock after an interval t is approximated as t sy(t).\n\nImportant frequency stability influences are temperature, time (aging and\n\nshort-term stability), line voltage, and warm up. Typical performances of some\n\noscillator compensation techniques are provided in Table 6.2. Other oscillator\n\nfrequency influences are drive energy, gravity, shock, vibration, electromagnetic\n\nsignals physically close to the oscillator, retrace, and hysteresis [28]. Line voltage\n\nspecifications for an instrument refer to changes in the AC line supply power.\n\nWarm up is a special case of temperature variation which is brought about by the\n\ntemperature rise from oscillator turn-on until stable operating point is reached.\n\nIt may not be apparent that a temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO),\n\ntreated in the following, would have a warm up specification, and in fact, it is\n\ntypically not specified. However, any instrument when placed into operation will\n\ngenerate a certain amount of heat. This heat elevates the temperature surrounding\n\nthe crystal, and therefore, causes a frequency change. As is clear from Table 6.2,\n\noscillator stability is very sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Since mass provides\n\ninertia against temperature changes and is therefore beneficial, miniaturization of\n\noscillators is difficult.\n\nTable 6.2 Oscillator comparison\n\nTCXO MCXO OCXO\n\nAccuracya/year [?] 2 ? 10?6 5 ? 10?8 1 ? 10?8\nAging/year [?] 5 ? 10?7 2 ? 10?8 5 ? 10?9\nTemp. stability [?]\n(range, \tC)\n\n5 ? 10?7\n(?55 to + 85)\n\n3 ? 10?8\n(?55 to + 85)\n\n1 ? 10?9\n(?55 to + 85)\n\nAllan deviation [?] (t \u00bc 1 s) 1 ? 10?9 3 ? 10?10 1 ? 10?12\nSize (cm3) 10 30 20\u2013200\n\nWarmup time (min) 0.03 (to 1 ? 10?6) 0.03 (to 2 ? 10?8) 4 (to 1 ? 10?8)\nPower (W) (at lowest temp.) 0.04 0.04 0.6\n\nApproximate price (US$) 10\u2013100 <1,000 200\u20132,000\n\nThe first four rows are expressed in terms of the fractional frequency error Df/f0 [27]\naIncluding environmental effects\n\n254 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nThe stability of a standard crystal oscillator without any means of compensation\n\nis too low to use for relative navigation in space. As temperature has a major effect\n\non the frequency stability of an oscillator, most compensating designs focus on\n\nlimiting the frequency change induced by a temperature change as much as\n\npossible. In a temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO), the output signal\n\nfrom a temperature sensor (a thermistor) is used to generate a correction voltage\n\nthat is applied to a voltage-variable reactance (a varactor) in the crystal network.\n\nThe reactance variations produce frequency changes that are equal and opposite to\n\nthe frequency changes resulting from temperature changes. In other words, the\n\nreactance variations compensate for the crystal\u2019s frequency versus temperature\n\nvariations. In an oven controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), the crystal unit and\n\nother temperature sensitive components of the oscillator circuit are maintained at a\n\nconstant temperature in an oven. The crystal is manufactured to have a frequency\n\nversus temperature characteristic which has zero slope at the oven temperature.\n\nThe best oscillator stability is achieved when the operating point is 15\u201320\t above\nthe highest temperature to which the unit will be exposed. A special case of a\n\ncompensated oscillator is the microcomputer-compensated crystal oscillator\n\n(MCXO). The MCXO overcomes the two major factors that limit the stability\n\nachievable with a TCXO: thermometry and the stability of the crystal unit.\n\nInstead of a thermometer that is external to the crystal unit, such as a thermistor,\n\nthe MCXO uses a much more accurate, \u201cself-temperature sensing\u201d method: Two\n\nmodes of the crystal are excited simultaneously in a dual-mode oscillator. The two\n\nmodes are combined such that the resulting beat frequency is a monotonic\n\n(and nearly linear) function of temperature. The crystal thereby senses its own\n\ntemperature. To reduce the frequency versus temperature variations, the MCXO\n\nuses digital compensation techniques: pulse deletion in one implementation, and\n\ndirect digital synthesis of a compensating frequency in another. Other than in an\n\nTCXO, the frequency of the crystal in an MCXO is not \u201cpulled,\u201d which allows the\n\nuse of high-stability crystal units [29].\n\nFor relative navigation, the short-term stability of an oscillator is the most\n\nimportant parameter. There, the OCXO clearly outperforms all other quartz-based\n\ncrystal oscillators. However, its size and power requirements can be much larger\n\nthan that of a TCXO or MCXO. Thus, if the oscillator-induced measurement\n\nnoise is not driving the overall navigation accuracy, a TCXO or MCXO can be a\n\nbetter choice.\n\n6.4 System Examples and Performance\n\nDuring the last two decades, almost a dozen RF-based relative navigation systems\n\nhave been designed for various distributed system missions. However, the vast\n\nmajority of these missions were never launched and therefore extremely little\n\non-orbit experience has been gained with this technology. This section will first\n\nbriefly introduce the systems that never made it to space. Then, it will discuss the\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 255\n\n\n\nonly system with actual flight heritage: the FFRF. Note that systems that are not\n\ncapable of providing standalone relative navigation solutions, such as the K-band\n\nranging (KBR) system on the GRACE mission or the Lunar Gravity Ranging\n\nSystem (LGRS) on the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mis-\n\nsion, are not considered here. Typical testing and validation approaches are also\n\ntreated. Finally, on-orbit performance characteristics, necessarily limited to the\n\nFFRF, are also provided.\n\n6.4.1 Systems Without Flight Heritage\n\nThe following list provides a brief summary of RF-based relative navigation\n\nsystems without flight heritage. All these systems have been developed in the\n\nUSA and are based on GPS technology.\n\n\u2022 AFF (Autonomous Formation Flying): The AFF sensor has been developed by\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the USA and is based on the TurboRogue\n\nGPS receiver. The AFF was originally developed for the discontinued Deep\n\nSpace-3 (DS-3) mission, the discontinued Space Technology-3 (ST-3) mission,\n\nthe discontinued StarLight mission, and the postponed TPF mission (TPF was\n\npostponed in 2007 due to budget cuts). The AFF is also referred to as Acquisition\n\nSensor.\n\n\u2022 CCNT (Constellation Communications and Navigation Transceiver): JPL also\ndeveloped the CCNT, which was based on the AFF sensor. It was developed for\n\nthe ST-5 mission, but although the ST-5 mission flew successfully from March\n\n22, 1996 to June 29, 1996, the CCNT did not fly on ST-5.\n\n\u2022 CLT (Crosslink Transceiver): The CLT was developed by the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL) in the USA and based on\n\ntheir space-qualified spaceborne GPS Navigation System (GNS). A derivative of\n\nthe CLT, the NanoSat CLT (NCLT) was intended to fly in 2004 on the ION-F\n\nmission, consisting of three university satellites. Three flight-ready NCLTs were\n\ndelivered, but the mission never flew.\n\n\u2022 LPT (Low Power Transceiver): Development of the LPT started in fall 1998 as a\njoint effort by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the Advanced\n\nEngineering and Sciences department (formerly Stanford Telecom) of ITT\n\nIndustries, Inc. in the USA. At a later stage, also the Air Force Research\n\nLaboratory (AFRL) got involved in the development since the LPT had been\n\nselected to fly on its XSS-11 satellite. Initially, the LPT was not intended to be\n\nused as a relative navigation sensor since it was not foreseen to generate its own\n\nranging signal. It was a modular, reprogrammable, transceiver capable of auton-\n\nomous navigation based on GPS data. At a later stage in its development, an\n\ninter-satellite ranging capability was added. From 1998 to 2006, the LPT has\n\nevolved over three generations and has flown on the Space Shuttle (2003), on the\n\nXSS-11 mission (2005), and on the TacSat-2 satellite (2006), but never as a\n\n256 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nrelative navigation sensor. A fourth generation, the Miniature Multifunctional\n\nIntegrated Terminal or M2inT (also referred to as the Miniature Transceiver or\n\nMinT), was planned to be developed, but no substantial M2inT/MinT hardware\n\nhas been produced so far.\n\n\u2022 Star Ranger: The Star Ranger was developed by the company AeroAstro\nsituated in Solana Beach, California, USA. The funding source for the develop-\n\nment was the AFRL. It had been specifically developed for nano- and\n\nmicro-satellites and was intended to fly on AFRL\u2019s cancelled TechSat 21 mission\n\n(cancelled in 2003).\n\n\u2022 IRAS (Intersatellite Ranging and Alarm System): IRAS is currently under\ndevelopment by NASA GSFC in the USA for the Magnetospheric Multiscale\n\n(MMS) mission which is slated for launch in 2014. It is composed out of the\n\nNavigator weak-signal GPS receiver and an S-band transceiver with ranging\n\ncapability.\n\n\u2022 SPTC (Stanford Pseudolite Transceiver Crosslink): The SPTC was developed at\nStanford University in the USA around the turn of the century. The SPTC was\n\ndesigned using commercial off the shelf (COTS) devices such as modems, L1\n\npseudolites, and a GPS receiver (Mitel GP2000). No specific mission was\n\ntargeted for the SPTC.\n\n\u2022 RelNav-DDF (Relative Navigation) sensor: The RelNav-DFF sensor is currently\nunder development by Tethers Unlimited, Inc. (TUI) in the USA under funding\n\nfrom DARPA. No specific mission is targeted for the RelNav-DDF sensor and\n\npractically no data on it is publically available.\n\n6.4.2 Systems With Flight Heritage\n\nAt this point in time, the only RF-based relative navigation system with actual flight\n\nheritage is the FFRF (Formation Flying Radio Frequency). The FFRF has been\n\ndeveloped by TAS-France, TAS-Spain and GMV and is derived from the\n\nTOPSTAR 3000 GPS receiver. The FFRF sensor is being flight tested and validated\n\non the Swedish PRISMA (Prototype Research Instruments and Space Mission\n\ntechnology Advancement) mission, launched in June 2010, and is foreseen by\n\nESA and CNES to be used as the first metrology stage on future FF missions like\n\nPROBA-3 and Darwin. The FFRF sensor is designed to provide relative positioning\n\n(ranging and LOS measurements) for up to 4 satellites and for an operational range\n\nfrom 10 m to 10 km. It includes one RF terminal and up to four sets of antennas\n\non each satellite. A set of antennas can be either a triplet, which is composed of\n\n1 Receive/Transmit (Rx/Tx) master antenna and 2 Rx-only slave antennas (the\n\ntriplet is required for LOS computation), or a single Rx/Tx antenna (allows ranging\n\nonly). Using multi-antenna bases and TDMA sequencing, each terminal transmits\n\nand receives a GPS C/A navigation signal modulated on two S-band carrier\n\nfrequencies (S1 \u00bc 2,275 MHz and S2 \u00bc 2,105 MHz) [30].\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 257\n\n\n\nThe inter-satellite ranging relies on two-way measurements to account for the\n\nrelative clock drift of the platforms. First, range measurements are based on\n\nthe unambiguous C/A code signal that provides meter-level accuracy. Next, centi-\n\nmeter-level accuracy can be achieved using carrier phase measurements as soon as\n\nthe signal ambiguities (lS1 \u00bc 13.2 cm) have been removed. Similarly, LOS\nmeasurements are obtained from the carrier phase differences between two\n\nantennas of the triplet antenna base and accuracy better than 1\t can be achieved\nafter removal of the signal ambiguity.\n\nCarrier phase ambiguity resolution for distance relies on the dual frequency\n\nsignal that allows to produce a larger wavelength synthetic signal (wide-lane,\n\nlWL \u00bc 176 cm). The procedure actually starts by removing the ambiguity on the\nLOS in order to get rid of the potential direction dependent biases due to multi-path\n\neffects. When the LOS is determined with the highest accuracy (<1\t), biases can be\ncompensated/mitigated and the ambiguity on the wide-lane can be solved by\n\ncodefiltering. The last step consists in filtering the wide-line data over time to\n\nreduce the uncertainty level below the carrier phase wavelength and finally achieve\n\nthe highest precision (1 cm). In the current design, the FFRF sensor cannot remove\n\nby itself the carrier phase ambiguity on the LOS. Ambiguity removal requires a\n\nrotation of the spacecraft along a direction roughly normal to the base of antennas.\n\nBy processing the FFRF signals and using the satellite attitude information, the\n\nambiguity can be removed after a rotation of about 50\t.\nThe FFRF terminal is composed of the following hardware components, cf.\n\nFig. 6.8b: RF front end (or RFE), Transmitter RF module, Receiver RF modules,\n\nDigital Processing Unit, DC/DC and OXCO unit. All modules are stacked together\n\nexcept for the RF filters (Rx and Tx) which can be accommodated separately.\n\nFor the PRISMA mission, the FFRF terminal design differs for the two satellites\n\n(different RFE and Rx units) because they have different antenna configurations\n\n(the chaser, Mango, is connected to a unique antenna triplet whereas the target,\n\nTango, carries three single Rx/Tx antennas). The masses of the terminals are 7 and\n\n9 kg and their power consumption is between 23 and 30 W.\n\nThe FFRF sensor delivers at 1 Hz two types of metrology information: (1) RF\n\nsignal raw data such as code-based pseudorange, carrier phase, and delta carrier\n\nphase from each terminal and clock bias, (2) Position, Velocity, Time (PVT) and\n\nLOS snapshot of the companion satellite. Each terminal implements software in\n\nFig. 6.8 FFRF ranging principle (a) and terminal architecture (b)\n\n258 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\ncharge of computing the relative PVT from FFRF raw measurements (when IAR is\n\ncompleted, this data represents a measurement snapshot involving mostly geomet-\n\nric relations). The high level filtering functionality based on an EKF is implemented\n\ninside the GNC software running on the satellite On-Board Computer (OBC) and\n\nconstitutes the main part of the relative navigation function. The PVT software\n\nremoves the signal ambiguities with a specific algorithm combining signal smooth-\n\ning techniques and use of external aiding data provided by the GNC system. The\n\naiding data is twofold: (1) spacecraft attitude quaternions to solve the LOS ambi-\n\nguity (which requires a rotation of the satellite) and (2) relative position data for\n\nsignal acquisition and navigation: this allows speeding up the RF signal acquisition\n\nat sensor power-up or after tracking loss.\n\n6.4.3 Testing and Validation\n\nThe testing and validation approach for the FFRF sensor is detailed in the\n\nfollowing. Examples for other relative navigation sensors could also be provided,\n\nbut would be very similar as the testing and validation approach taken is often very\n\ncomparable to what has been done for the FFRF. Therefore, as the previous and\n\nnext subsections are devoted to the FFRF, it has been chosen to limit the subject of\n\nthis subsection to the FFRF as well.\n\nEnd to end ground testing within the full operational range is a very challenging\n\nexercise for several reasons: (1) the need to provide long range mobility, (2)\n\nmultipath effects induced by the ground testing configuration have to be avoided;\n\n(3) reference measurements for performance characterization must be provided. An\n\nambitious approach would consist in accommodating the FFRF sensor on air\n\nvehicles like balloons or helicopters equipped with differential GPS to remove\n\nthe ground-induced multipath effects. A more cost effective solution is to perform\n\nthe validation in two successive steps described hereafter:\n\n\u2022 Build a high fidelity model through specific FFRF sensor characterization:\nSensor performances are measured inside an anechoic chamber in order to\n\ndetermine residual biases due to multipath effects but also uncertainties in the\n\ninternal path delays and the position of the antenna phase centers \u2013 the collected\n\ndata allows to build an accurate FFRF sensor numeric model (introduction of\n\nattitude dependent bias maps in the RF signal generator).\n\n\u2022 Extensive validation through simulations based on the high fidelity model:\nSimulate the behavior of the RF navigation system by using a numeric simulator\n\nincluding a realistic model of the PRISMA satellites and the environment, the\n\nupdated FFRF sensor model and the GNC algorithms \u2013 the navigation perfor-\n\nmance is characterized over the whole dynamic and geometric range.\n\nThe sensor characterization relies on engineering models that are mounted\n\non representative satellite mock-ups from the radio-electric point of view (conducted\n\nand radiated tests). Both satellites are accommodated inside a 20m anechoic chamber\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 259\n\n\n\nthat is equipped with a parabolic reflector to generate parallel radio-electric rays, cf.\n\nFig. 6.9. The radio reflector, along with signal attenuators, allows the simulation of\n\nlong range relative configurations. Each satellite is successivelymounted on a robotic\n\narm to scan attitudes over a half hemisphere and thus measure its specific bias\n\ncartography. This phase allows also characterization of critical functionalities (signal\n\nacquisition conditions, IAR success rate). Afterwards, the FFRF sensor model,\n\ncomposed of a numeric RF signal/data processing simulator and the real sensor\n\nalgorithms, is updated by feeding it with the bias maps.\n\nThe RF navigation validation has been performed in two types of simulator\n\nenvironments:\n\n\u2022 A numeric simulator implemented in a Matlab/Simulink\u00ae environment that\n\nincludes high fidelity models of the various PRISMA components, the space\n\nenvironment and the FFRF sensor. This flexible and computationally efficient\n\nsimulator is dedicated to performance assessment over the full operational range\n\nthrough extensive test campaigns including Monte Carlo tests.\n\n\u2022 The PRISMA avionics testbench that is a real time environment devoted to\n\nthe satellites\u2019 flight software validation. This test-bench is composed of the\n\nsatellites\u2019 avionics with the complete data handling architecture. Some real\n\nequipment is present and missing equipment is replaced by emulators that are\n\ninterfaced via Remote Terminal Units (RTU). An emulator of the FFRF sensor\n\nbuilt from the Simulink model is integrated in the testbench with interfaces to the\n\ndata handling system and also the satellite simulator. This configuration allows\n\nvalidating the navigation software (built by auto-coding from Simulink models)\n\nin dynamic conditions and in relation with all critical architecture components.\n\nThe purpose of the tests is to verify the full functional behaviour and identify\n\npeculiarities that are implemented afterwards in the numeric simulator to\n\nimprove its fidelity level.\n\nThe final performance assessment is performed in flight. It relies on reference\n\nmeasurements provided by GPS receivers on both satellites which are later\n\nFig. 6.9 The CNES anechoic chamber (a) and a radio-electric mockup of one of the PRISMA\n\nsatellite (Mango) (b)\n\n260 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\npost-processed on the ground for maximum relative positioning accuracy. The level\n\nof achievable accuracy is a few millimeters on three axes and is consistent with the\n\nvalidation purposes.\n\n6.4.4 Achievable Performance\n\nThe achievable performance for the FFRF sensor is detailed in the following. The\n\nperformance of the overall RF navigation system depends directly on the capability\n\nto solve the ambiguities during the FFRF sensor initialization phase. Characteriza-\n\ntion tests performed in the anechoic chamber have allowed verification of the\n\nsuccess rate of the IAR process and determination of the level of potential residual\n\nerrors:\n\n\u2013 LOS ambiguity resolution with a rotation maneuver turns out to be very\n\nrobust to multipath effects even for initial misalignments up to 80\t (success\nrate \u00bc 100%).\n\n\u2013 Distance ambiguity resolution is conversely very sensitive to residual electrical\n\nbiases and multipath which produces a rather low success rate. The remaining\n\nbias error that is a half wavelength multiple can reach up to 80 cm.\n\nIn addition to the distance bias potentially provoked by a faulty IAR, the FFRF\n\nsensor is subject to conducted and radiated errors that reach in a 30\t elevation cone\nthe values reported in Table 6.3.\n\nThe achievable navigation performance is strongly dependent on the orbital\n\nenvironment. Low Earth Orbits (LEO) allow to reach the best performance since\n\nthe orbital mechanics produce a strong coupling between the Cartesian components\n\nwhich speed up EKF convergence. This coupling offers also the possibility to\n\nestimate quasi-constant LOS biases due to position uncertainties (errors in the\n\nantenna mounting or phase center model) and multipath errors. Typical perfor-\n\nmance is shown in Table 6.4 for quasi stationary configurations in the PRISMA\n\norbital environment (700 km altitude, circular orbit). They are given as statistical\n\nvalues (mean, standard deviation) computed over an orbital period after some\n\nconvergence time (6,000 s).\n\nThe along track performance shows some degradation with distance due to\n\nionospheric errors that are not compensated (a possible 80 cm bias due to distance\n\nIAR error must be added also to these figures). The estimation is quite efficient in\n\nthe orbital plane with accuracy better than 1 cm below 1 km. Conversely, filter\n\nTable 6.3 Conducted and radiated errors for the FFRF in a 30\t elevation cone\nFFRF measurement Distance (mm) LOS (mm)\n\nConducted 1.5 1.6\n\nRadiated (1s) 4 6\nTotal 5.5 7.6\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 261\n\n\n\nconvergence in cross-track is much slower due to the lack of dynamic coupling and\n\nthe error reaches large values for a distance of several km.

Some suggestions for future developments and focus\n\npoints are also provided.\n\n6.5.1 Summary\n\nFor distributed systems in space, knowledge of the relative position and velocity is\n\ntypically required to maintain the relative geometry of the satellites within certain\n\nboundaries. This can be achieved using relative navigation based on GNSS, but it\n\ncan be desired to (also) implement an autonomous relative navigation system based\n\non RF signals. These signals are used to measure the range (rate) between\n\nthe satellites, which allows, in combination with a relative dynamics model and\n\nthe exchange of data between the satellites, an onboard estimation of the relative\n\nposition and velocity of the satellites.\n\nThis process is however fraught with difficulties due to the challenging environ-\n\nment and due to hardware limitations. First of all, the signal design should allow for\n\nreliable and unambiguous range measurements but also allow for data exchange.\n\nWhen the system is composed out of many satellites, multiple access considerations\n\nbecome important since the signals should not interfere with each other but at the\n\nsame time measurements should be conducted at a sufficiently high rate to\n\nguarantee high relative navigation accuracy and safety.\n\nThe hardware necessary to facilitate this has to be rugged enough to survive the\n\nrigors of space, but also flexible and adaptable whilst in orbit. Hardware-induced\n\nmeasurement biases should be minimized and, since a range measurement is basi-\n\ncally a measurement of time-of-flight of a signal, the onboard clock has to be very\n\nTable 6.4 Relative navigation error statistics for the FFRF\n\nDistance (m) 300 1,000 3,000 6,000 9,000\n\nAlong track (m) Mean 0.023 0.010 0.166 0.393 0.684\n\nStd. dev. 3e-4 2.4e-3 9e-4 0.004 0.013\n\nCross track (m) Mean 0.03 0.046 0.131 0.220 0.030\n\nStd. dev. 0.050 0.335 1.792 6.824 16.524\n\nRadial (m) Mean 0.001 1.2e-4 0.002 0.004 0.006\n\nStd. dev. 6.9e-3 8.8e-3 0.011 0.022 0.036\n\n262 D.

In the last two decades, systems have been\n\ndeveloped that can autonomously perform RF-based relative navigation in space,\n\nbut up to now actual operation of these systems in space has been very limited.\n\n6.6 Conclusions\n\nThis chapter started with a discussion on the overall concept of relative navigation\n\nusing locally generated radio frequency (RF) ranging signals known as Direct\n\nSequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) signals. With these signals, the phase shift\n\nof a code modulated on top of a carrier signal or the phase shift of the carrier signal\n\nitself between a transmitter and a receiver can be measured. This phase shift can\n\nbe translated to a range if the integer number of code or carrier cycles between\n\nthe transmitter and the receiver is known, which is trivial for the code-based\n\nmeasurements but hard for the carrier phase measurements. This technique is also\n\napplied in position determination using GNSS signals and is therefore well-\n\nestablished. The difference between autonomous relative navigation between\n\nsatellites and position determination using GNSS signals is that the latter\n\nrequires only one-way signals to be sent between the GNSS satellite and the\n\nuser while autonomous relative navigation between satellites typically requires a\n\ntwo-way signal or dual one-way signals to be exchanged between the satellites.\n\nThe dynamical models used for the relative state estimation usually are linearized\n\nrelative motion models such as those from Clohessy-Wiltshire or Tschauner-\n\nHempel, although absolute motion models are sometimes applied as well. A\n\nsuitable estimator for the relative navigation is the Extended Kalman Filter\n\n(EKF). This can be applied centrally or distributed, depending on the system\n\nrequirements.\n\nThe design of the ranging signal itself is firstly limited by the available\n\nfrequencies. In addition, for systems with many satellites, multiple access solutions\n\nare required to prevent signal interference and to guarantee the timely exchange of\n\ndata (e.g., measurements, housekeeping, command and control). For the coding\n\nof the signal, many options are present amongst which there are the spreading code\n\ntype and length, the spreading symbol shape and width, the width of a data bit, the\n\ntype of data modulation, and the type of error correction coding.\n\nThe hardware design has to be such that multipath and hardware-induced biases\n\nare minimized. Also, the relative navigation sensor should have a 4p steradian field\nof view if the system is to be fully autonomous. This results in a trade-off between\n\nantenna gain and total number of antennas. The transceiver used to generate and\n\nreceive the ranging signals shall have a stable reference source and shall accurately\n\nreproduce the ranging signal even in the presence of component aging. Finally, it\n\nshall also have low mass and low power consumption. Depending on the level of\n\nsystem integration, the transceiver can also be required to process the measure-\n\nments (smoothing) or even to perform some level of estimation.\n\n6 Radio Frequency-Based Relative Navigation 263\n\n\n\nIn the last two decades, almost a dozen, mainly U.S., relative navigation sensors\n\nhave been designed and developed. However, only one sensor, the FFRF\n\n(Formation Flying Radio Frequency) has actually been operated in space. Most of\n\nthese systems are modified GPS receivers and provide roughly cm-level relative\n\nnavigation performance and have a mass of several kilograms. Testing and valida-\n\ntion is mandatory to chart measurement biases due to multipath and hardware\n\ndelays. Emulation of the entire system, preferably using flight hardware, is also\n\nnecessary to gain confidence in the performance of the system and to allow early\n\ndetection of mistakes/issues.\n\n6.6.1 Way Forward\n\nThere are many alternative paths that can be taken to advance the performance of\n\nRF-based relative navigation systems. In the following list, suggestions are given\n\nfor areas in which further research and development can be beneficial in the future.\n\n1. RF-based relative navigation system designs should take advantage of the\n\nexperience gained with modernized GNSS signals. New spreading symbol\n\nshapes (e.g. BOC), signals with a pilot and a data component, and tiered codes\n\nare examples that can be explored to improve performance.\n\n2. Carrier phase integer ambiguity resolution has to be facilitated by the ranging\n\nsignal itself. This removes the need for a geometry change to solve the integer\n\nambiguity problem, which will be infeasible for a system consisting of many\n\nsatellites. For that, the \u201cultra-BOC\u201d signal devised for the AFF sensor is an\n\nexcellent starting point.\n\n3. Short-delay multipath is currently an important source for measurement bias\n\nand can cause failure of the integer ambiguity resolution process. This should\n\neither be removed as much as possible, for instance by using multipath-limiting\n\nantennas, or be made detectable through smart signal design and/or via software.\n\n4. Current relative navigation devices make maximum use of GPS heritage.\n\nHowever, alternatives such as designs based on ultra-wideband (UWB) signals\n\nor radar with active targets, which have been developed in the last couple of\n\nyears, should also be explored as these might lead to system improvements.\n\n5. Terrestrial networking solutions such as the internet protocol and delay-tolerant\n\nnetworks should be explored for their merit in autonomous space systems with a\n\nlarge number of satellites.\n\nFurthermore, high data rates can be expected for future autonomous formations,\n\nthis should be facilitated in future designs. Also, radiation-hard high-density\n\nFPGAs allow a shift from analog to reconfigurable digital designs. This allows a\n\nlarge amount of on-orbit re-programmability for mission extension/adaptation\n\n(e.g. different signal waveforms). Designs should also be modular to support\n\nvarious missions with a single instrument tailored to the specific mission needs.\n\n264 D. Maessen et al.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Indeed, with a vision\n\nsystem the relative position and attitude (usually referred to in the machine vision\n\nliterature as \u201cpose\u201d) of co-flying satellites can be extracted in real-time. This\n\ninformation can be used either to maintain or change the formation geometry. A\n\ncrucial aspect affecting vision system design and development is the operation with\n\nlargely variable lighting conditions and the interference caused by the presence of\n\nother celestial bodies in the sensor field of view. This requires the implementation\n\nof effective image processing techniques and algorithms by which robust, accurate\n\nand reliable pose estimation can be achieved. This chapter provides an overview of\n\nsensors, techniques and algorithms enabling the relative navigation based on vision,\n\nwith specific reference to space missions which have already tested in flight this\n\ntechnology.\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\nThis chapter describes sensors, technologies, techniques and algorithms relevant to\n\nvision systems for the relative navigation of Formation Flying (FF) satellites.\n\nVision is a key technology for the relative navigation of satellites flying in\n\nformation, especially when they come into close proximity as a result of the relative\n\norbit selected to achieve a specific mission objective, either scientific or technology\n\ndemonstration and validation.\n\nThe vision system may be passive or active, being equipped in this last case with\n\nlaser range finders that illuminate reflectors installed on the tracked satellite\n\nD.

In this regard, several solutions\n\nhave been proposed and some of them already tested in flight. They will be\n\ndescribed in this chapter.\n\nFrom the vision-based navigation standpoint the tracked satellite can be cooper-\n\native or not. In the former case it is usually equipped with Light Emitting Diodes\n\n(LEDs) or Reflectors which can be easily imaged by a camera on board a chaser\n\nsatellite independently from the particular lighting conditions or the interference of\n\nother celestial bodies (mainly Earth and Sun) in the camera Field of View (FOV). In\n\nthe latter case, techniques and algorithms capable of extracting features of the\n\ntracked satellite, such as binarization, contour mapping, and edge detection, can\n\nbe used to set up the synthetic information that well be used to determine\n\nthe relative pose (i.e. position and attitude). These techniques and algorithms will\n\nbe described in this chapter.\n\nConcerning pose estimation, several techniques and algorithms can be used\n\nto compute the pose from the synthetic information extracted from the images.\n\nThese techniques can be broadly divided in monocular and three dimensional (3D).\n\nThe former ones perform relative navigation on the basis of angular-only estimates,\n\nwhile the latter methods make use also of range information provided by a\n\nstereovision system or by a laser range finder. Moreover, pose estimation can be\n\nrefined on the basis of relative dynamics modeling and optimal filtering techniques.\n\nThese techniques will be described in this chapter, as well.\n\nThe chapter is organized as follows: in the first section an overview of sensors and\n\ntechnologies for vision-based relative navigation is provided with specific reference\n\nto space missions already performed or still in flight. The second section instead\n\ndescribes the image processing techniques and algorithms adopted to extract the\n\ninformation on the position of selected targets in the sensor reference frame. Finally,\n\nthe third section focuses on the algorithms and methods to estimate the relative pose\n\non the basis of a synthetic information extracted from the vision system.\n\n7.2 Missions, Sensors and Technologies\n\nThis section provides an overview of sensors and technologies for vision-based\n\nrelative navigation with specific reference to space missions which have already\n\nvalidated in flight such technologies.\n\nAt the present, no formation flying missions with specific scientific objectives\n\nhave been performed carrying on board a vision-based system for the relative\n\nnavigation, although in the open literature vision is reported as a key technology\n\nfor next-generation formation-flying missions. Thus, with the aim of performing a\n\nquantitative analysis of developed sensors and technologies, we consider already\n\nflown space missions in which experiments have been executed in flight to test\n\nautonomous navigation technologies for rendezvous, docking, proximity flight and\n\nformation flying. In particular, in the following we will describe the following\n\nmissions and programs:\n\n268 D.

Nevertheless, sensors, technologies,\n\ntechniques and algorithms tested in these missions are of great relevance also to\n\nformation flying missions, since approach/separation and proximity flight are\n\nphases relevant to formation flying applications in which the several satellites fly\n\nwith short separations or formation re-configuration maneuvers are planned.\n\nIt is worth noting that, other than the ones reported in Tables 7.1 and 7.2, in the\n\nnext few years other missions are planned by the European Space Agency (ESA)\n\nwithin the in-orbit technology demonstration program. They are:\n\n\u2013 Proba-3, with the aim to demonstrate precision formation flying technologies\n\nand techniques as precursor of future ESA missions [2]\n\n\u2013 SMART-OLEV, managed by an European Consortium [3], with the aim of\n\ndeveloping a servicing system to extend the mission lifetime of GEO communi-\n\ncation satellites\n\n\u2013 DEutscheOrbitale Servicing Mission (DEOS), by DLR, with the main objective\n\nof testing technologies for the capture of a non-cooperative tumbling satellite [4].\n\nFor the sake of conciseness, in the following sections the DART mission is not\n\nreported since the sensor embarked on DART is the same sensor (except for some\n\nsoftware changes and minor modifications) successfully tested on Orbital Express,\n\nwhich, instead, is described in details. In addition, DART was not successfully\n\ncompleted since the two satellites collided.\n\n7.2.1 Microsatellite Technology Development Program\n\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory established the Micro-Satellite Technology\n\nDevelopment Program (XSS series of flight demonstrations) to test in space new\n\ntechnologies for future space missions. In this framework, XSS-10 and XSS-11\n\nflights intended to develop and verify key technologies and operational aspects of\n\non-orbit guidance, navigation and control for autonomous rendezvous and proxim-\n\nity flight operations [5, 6]. Specifically, the XSS-10 program, started in 1997 and\n\nlaunched in January 2003 as a successor of the cancelled Clementine II program,\n\nconsisted of a micro-satellite ejected from the orbiting Delta II second stage and\n\nperforming a series of semi-autonomous maneuvers around the second stage to\n\ndemonstrate relative navigation, proximity operations and related real-time com-\n\nmunication technologies, and inspection and tracking of a Resident Space Object\n\n(RSO). XSS-10 (an illustration of the system can be found at the web site www.\n\naerospace-technology.com/projects/xss-10microsatellite/) was equipped with a vis-\n\nible camera, a GPS receiver, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a light weight\n\nstar sensor, a transponder for the ground link and a flight software for relative\n\nnavigation and proximity operations. A specific objective of the XSS-10 mission\n\nwas to maneuver around (by using prefixed inspection points) and demonstrate\n\nstation keeping capabilities relative to a RSO based on visible imaging, relative\n\nposition and inertial position/attitude knowledge. In particular, a major goal was to\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 271\n\nhttp://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/xss-10microsatellite/\nhttp://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/xss-10microsatellite/\n\n\ndemonstrate the capability of acquiring and tracking a space object with the on-\n\nboard CCD visible sensor by using a relative navigation scheme based on\n\ncentroiding information from the camera collecting images of the RSO at prefixed\n\ninspection points. Specifically, the GN&C software updated the relative state by\n\ncombining RSO images from the camera with an on-board relative state propagator\n\nrelying on the Clohessy-Wiltshire formulation of the relative motion, while track-\n\ning the RSO at the designed inspection points. Inter-point maneuvers were\n\nperformed to place the RSO centroid in the centre of the camera Field of View\n\n(FOV): off-sets from the center represented error in the relative state estimate. The\n\nGN&C software used this centroid location information to update the relative state\n\nat each point. A Delta II second stage image taken from on-board XSS-10 can be\n\nfound at the web site www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/xss.htm.\n\nThe XSS-11 was launched on 11 April 2005 on a Minotaur expendable launch\n\nvehicle. After completing systems checkout of the Minotaur I upper stage, the\n\nmicro satellite successfully demonstrated rendezvous and proximity operations\n\nwith the rocket body. It has accomplished more than 75 circumnavigations of the\n\nlaunch vehicle. The XSS-11 spacecraft contained a IMU for angular rate and\n\nacceleration sensing, a coarse sun sensor assembly for sun acquisition, a visible\n\ncamera system for star detection and target imaging, and a scanning light detection\n\nand ranging (LIDAR) instrument to determine relative range and angle\n\nmeasurements to the target.\n\n7.2.2 Engineering Test Satellite\n\nIn 1997 the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) performed\n\nthe Engineering Test Satellite (ETS-VII) flight experiment to validate enabling\n\ntechnologies for on-orbit autonomous coordinated flight, rendezvous and docking,\n\nand proximity flight operations of future missions. The mission consisted of two\n\nsatellites, \u201cHikoboshi\u201d (the chaser satellite) and \u201cOrihime\u201d (the cooperating target\n\nsatellite), launched in mated configuration on the H-11 rocket to a 550-km, 35?\n\ninclined orbit [7]. During the experiments, the chaser released the target and drifted\n\naway to distances of up to 9 km. Subsequently, a rendezvous maneuver was\n\nexecuted to drive the chaser back close to the target and execute the docking [8].\n\nThis experiment represents one of the first flights in which vision-based\n\ntechnologies for relative navigation between two satellites was implemented in\n\norbit and carried out autonomously.\n\nIn order to perform the relative navigation task with respect to the target, the\n\nchaser satellite embarked GPS receivers, a rendezvous laser radar (RVR), a visible\n\nProximity Operation Sensor (PXS), an Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) and an Earth\n\nSensor Assembly (ESA). The target satellite was cooperative in the meaning that it\n\nwas equipped with RVR Corner-Cube Reflectors (CCRs) and PXS markers for\n\nchaser relative navigation. The sensors and the related markers were arranged so\n\nthat each sensor can distinguish its own marker set. It embarked also a GPS receiver\n\n272 D. Accardo et al.\n\nhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/xss.htm\n\n\nwhose data were transmitted to the chaser for the relative navigation by exploiting a\n\ndirect communication inter-link between the two satellites [9].\n\nThe sensors embarked on the two satellites allowed three different relative\n\nnavigation modes to be implemented depending on the inter-satellite separation\n\n[9, 10]. In particular, the GPS was used for separations larger than 500 m. Instead,\n\nfor shorter separations (see Table 7.3) the relative navigation between the two\n\nsatellites was performed by exploiting vision-based technologies.\n\nSpecifically, the RVR was used as the main sensor for the relative navigation in\n\nthe final approach phase (i.e. from 500 m to about 2 m). The sensor, whose accuracy\n\nspecifications are summarized in Table 7.4 [9, 10], measured the relative range and\n\nLine-Of-Sight (LOS) to the target (i.e. target azimuth and elevation angles). The\n\nRVR optical head contains a near-infrared laser diode which radiates pulsed light at\n\n810 nm wavelength into a 85? cone. The light beam is reflected from the CCRs on\nthe target back to the RVR optical head where it is imaged on a two-dimensional\n\nCCD array. Image processing is then implemented to evaluate the coordinates of\n\nthe reflected beam centroid on the CCD plane from which target azimuth and\n\nelevation can be computed. The relative range instead is determined from the\n\ndata of the Avalanche Photo Diode (APD) by computing the phase difference\n\nbetween the transmitted and received light beams. The RVR in-orbit accuracy\n\nwas ascertained to be well within the specification and in agreement with the\n\nGPS, PXS and ground test data [9, 10]. Specifically, in-orbit data agreed with\n\nground test measurements (with the two satellites in mated configuration) within\n\n2 cm in range and 0.1? in LOS, with random errors (3s) of about 5 mm in range and\nless than 0.01? in LOS [11].\n\nDuring docking (from 2 m to about 0.5 m) the relative navigation was performed\n\nwith the proximity sensor, which consisted of a CCD camera and an array of LEDs\n\non the chaser, and a 3D marker (micropitch CCR) on the target. The LED array\n\nTable 7.3 ETS-VII vision-based navigation phases and sensors\n\nPhase Relative range (m) Main navigation sensor Observables\n\nFinal approach 500\u20132 RVR Relative range/LOS\n\nDocking 2\u20130.5 PXS Relative pose\n\nTable 7.4 ETS-VII RVR accuracy specification\n\nMeasurement ranges Measurable relative range: 0.3?660 m\nFOV for range measurement: ?3?\nMeasurable LOS range: ?4?\nMax. measurable relative attitude angle: 15?\n\nMax. measurable relative speed: 1 m/s\n\nMax. measurable LOS rate: 0.5?/s\n\nMeasurement accuracy Range:\n\nBias \u00bc 10/60 cm (at min.-max. range)\nRandom (3s) \u00bc 0.6/22 cm (at min.-max. range)\nLOS: 0.05?

The marker consists\n\nof seven round shaped markers, with the central one behind the others that are\n\nsymmetrically positioned in sets of two (see Fig. 7.1 for a schematic). Relative\n\npose is determined by imaging markers on the camera focal plane. Specifically, the\n\ncentral marker and one of the three sets are used depending on the relative range.\n\nPitch and yaw rotations are detected by exploiting the position of the central marker\n\nthat is not collinear with the others, roll is computed by detecting the rotation of the\n\nbaseline vector between the two side markers. The relative position components are\n\nestimated by detecting the variation of the baseline length (longitudinal axis) and\n\nthe displacements on the focal plane of the baseline center (traverse axes). Table 7.5\n\nshows PXS accuracy specifications [9, 10, 12]. The PXS in-orbit accuracy was\n\nascertained to be much better than the specification [9, 10]. Specifically, in-orbit\n\ndata agreed with ground test measurements (with the two satellites in mated\n\nconfiguration) within 2 cm in range and 0.1? in LOS, with random errors (3 s) of\nabout 5 mm in range and less than 0.01? in LOS [11]. An illustration of the two\nsatellites and pictures of the sensors and reflectors used for the relative navigation\n\ncan be found in Refs. [13, 14].\n\n7.2.3 Orbital Express\n\nOrbital Express was a cooperative agreement between the Defense Advanced\n\nResearch Projects Agency (DARPA) and NASA.

It had to demonstrate enabling\n\ntechnologies for autonomous rendezvous, proximity flight, docking and satellite\n\non-orbit servicing. It consisted of two satellites launched in a mated configura-\n\ntion: Astro (Autonomous Space Transport Robotic Operation vehicle, the\n\nchaser), developed by Boeing, and NextSat (next-generation serviceable satellite\n\nprototype), the target, developed by Ball Aerospace. Launched in May 5 2007 on\n\nAtlas 5 rocket within the U.S. Air Force Space Test Program STP-1, after\n\nseparation the two satellites underwent a series of AR&D (Approach, Rendez-\n\nvous and Docking) maneuvers experiencing a variety of separation ranges [15].\n\nThe flight test lasted about 3 months on a 46?-inclined 492-km orbit. An illustra-\ntion of the system can be found at the web site boeing.net/bds/phantom_works/\n\norbital/oe_029.html.\n\nAstro embarked the Autonomous Rendezvous and Capture Sensor System\n\n(ARCSS), which included optical sensors for the relative navigation with respect\n\nto NextSat. Specifically, with reference to Fig. 7.2 there were two sets of optical\n\nsensors: one consisting of three imaging sensors and a laser rangefinder (installed\n\non a common optical bench), developed by Boeing, and the other consisting in the\n\nAVGS, developed by DARPA for DART mission. The two sets were used by\n\nthe Astro GN&C depending on the separation between the two satellites. NextSat\n\ninstead embarked the AVGS and ARCSS targets.\n\nGoing into more details, the first set of sensors included: two fixed-focus\n\ncameras, one narrow-field (6.5?) camera (VS1), for far range operations, and\none wide-field camera (about 40?) (VS2), for mid-to-short ranges operations,\nand a long-wave infrared imager (IRS), for continuous situational awareness,\n\nthat could detect the NextSat heat. A spotlight provided target illumination\n\nstarting at about 24 m. The narrow-field camera could detect and acquire the\n\ntarget satellite from about 200 km, when it was a point source, and determine the\n\nbearing to it in order to track it for approach operations. The wide-field camera\n\ncould supplement the first camera from about 100 km, and the IR camera operated\n\nVS1\n\nVS2\n\nIRS\n\nLRF\n\nAVGS\n\nOn-board \nComputer \n\nFig. 7.2 ARCSS\n\ncomposition schematic\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 275\n\n\n\nfrom about 24 km. This last one also provided backup in eclipse and difficult\n\nilluminating conditions.\n\nThe laser range finder (LRF) started to operate at about 10 km from the target by\n\nadding ranging information to the already available ones [16].\n\nData from the ARCSS available sensors were processed by a vision-based\n\nSoftware for tracking, attitude and ranging (Vis-STAR) to determine bearing,\n\nrange and relative attitude of the target. Specifically, at large distances, only bearing\n\nand range were computed. Instead, at shorter separations (starting from about 500m)\n\nthe target image became sufficiently large so that Vis-STAR could start computing\n\nindependently the attitude, from passive imaging (silhouette tracker), in addition to\n\nrange (from the laser range finder) and bearing. Attitude determination was\n\nperformed by correlating acquired target images with pre-loaded pictures of\n\nNextSat taken at different angles. Edge tracking techniques were used to discrimi-\n\nnate among ambiguous attitude solutions. Sub-degree accuracy was claimed in each\n\nrotation axis. Vis-STAR could work with both visual and IR data [16].\n\nThe ARCSS included also the AVGS, inherited from the DART program (except\n\nfor some software changes and minor modifications) [14], developed at Marshall\n\nSpace Flight Center. It is a near-field proximity navigation sensor (?8?FOV)\ncapable of computing 6-DOF solutions (relative position and attitude) for ranges\n\nup to 300 m. It represents an advancement of a prior concept, the Video Guidance\n\nSensor (VSG), successfully tested in flight on STS-87 (1997) and STS-95 (1998)\n\nmissions. Specifically, the AVGS has got improved performance and capabilities\n\nfor long-range operations [15].\n\nThe AVGS incorporates laser range finders emitting IR laser beams illuminating\n\ntwo sets of retro-reflective targets on NextSat (see schematic in Fig. 7.3): 4 Long-\n\nRange Targets (LRT), viewed from less than 10 m to about 100 m, and 4 Short-\n\nRange Targets (SRT), viewed from docking up to about 30 m, under nominal\n\nNEXTSat\n\nLRTs\n\nLRTs\nLRTs\n\nSRTs\n\nFig. 7.3 Schematic of AVGS\n\nSRT and LRT positioning on\n\nNEXTSat [17]\n\n276 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nconditions. In the schematic of Fig. 7.3, the central SRT is not collinear with\n\nthe others, it is about 20 cm off the figure plane. These targets are tracked over\n\ndifferent ranges of operation, and their reflections on the focal plane are processed,\n\ninstead of imaging the overall shape of the target [17]. In this way it is possible to\n\ncompute relative attitude, range and bearings at close separations in the approach\n\ncorridor (last 200 m prior capture). Although the DART mission experienced a\n\nfailure without the possibility of using the AVGS in closed loop, valuable bearing\n\ndata were collected with the AVGS operating in spot mode, showing nominal\n\nperformance [17].\n\nAVGS relies on two sets of laser diodes operating, respectively, at wavelength of\n\n800 and 850 nm, a mirror, a fixed-focus solid-state camera, that images the light\n\nreflected by the corner cubes installed into a known pattern on the target satellite,\n\nimage capture electronics and a digital signal processor to convert the video data\n\ninto the pose information. The two sets of lasers are fired asynchronously (at 5 Hz)\n\nat the two different wavelength with an offset of 0.1 s. One wavelength (800 nm) is\n\nabsorbed by a filter placed on the retro-reflectors, while the other is passed through\n\nthe filter and reflected back to the sensor to be imaged on the focal plane. Thus\n\nimages at 10 Hz of the target are captured: one image contains only the background\n\nwithout the CCRs and the other contains the background and the CCRs. The two\n\nimages are subtracted from one another leaving the CCRs which can be then easily\n\ndetected in the resulting image under variable ranges and lighting conditions [15].\n\nRelative range, bearing (azimuth and elevation) and attitude are computed by\n\nprocessing 2D images by inverse perspective algorithms which combine the spot\n\ndata with the known target pattern.\n\nFlights tests results on board Orbital Express with the AVGS operating in dual\n\ntrack mode (i.e. tracking both LRTs and SRTs), corresponding to ranges varying\n\nfrom about 10 to 30 m, shows that the sensor behaved according to specifications.\n\nFlight results in dual track mode were obtained by comparing the two pose\n\ncomputations achieved independently by tracking LRTs and SRTs. It is reported\n\nthat the range standard deviation was about 0.07 m, the azimuth and elevation\n\nstandard deviation was less than 0.01?, pitch and yaw noise was under 0.4?, and the\nroll noise less than 0.15?, according to sensor specifications [15]. For reader\nconvenience, the reported performance is summarized in Table 7.6. In the same\n\nTable also the flight results related to the mated configuration (range about 1.22 m)\n\n[15] are reported for the sake of completeness.\n\nTable 7.6 AVGS dual track mode and mated configuration 1s performance\nDual track mode Mated configuration\n\nParameter Noise performance Noise performance\n\nRelative range (m) 0.07 0.0025\n\nAzimuth-elevation (?) 0.01 0.005\nPitch/yaw (?) 0.4 0.12\nRoll (?) 0.15 0.04\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 277\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Prisma\n\nPRISMA is a mission funded by the Swedish National Space Board aiming at\n\ntesting in space enabling technologies for formation flying and rendezvous. The\n\nmission is supported also by CNES, DLR and the Danish Technical University.\n\nMission main goal is demonstrating autonomous GN&C, with specific reference to\n\nformation flying, homing and rendezvous, proximity operations and final approach\n\nand recede operations [18]. The mission relies on two satellites (an illustration of\n\nthe system can be found at the web site www.spaceportsweden.com/about-prisma.\n\naspx), MANGO (the main) and TANGO (the target). MANGO weights about\n\n150 kg, it is 3-axis stabilized and has got full 3D delta-V maneuverability in\n\norder to perform a series of maneuvers around the target on both long and close\n\nrange by using a set of sensors installed on board. TANGO is a 40-kg satellite\n\nequipped with a simple magnetic 3-axis attitude control system and has got no orbit\n\ncontrol and maneuvering capability. It can communicate with the main by means of\n\na 450 Hz interlink channel. The two satellites were launched in June 2010, in a\n\nmated configuration, as secondary payload with a Dnepr launcher into a 98?\n\ninclined sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of about 700 km [18\u201320].\n\nMANGO embarks various sensors to measure the relative position with respect\n\nto TANGO. Specifically, depending on the separation between the two satellites the\n\nfollowing relative navigation experiments are executed:\n\n\u2013 Differential GPS, for separations higher than 30 m\n\n\u2013 Vision-based, for separations from 500 km down to about 10 m\n\n\u2013 Radio-frequency based, for separations from 30 km to about 3 m [18\u201320]\n\nWe focus on the phases in which the vision sensor was used for relative\n\nnavigation. The vision-based sensor embarked on MANGO is designed and devel-\n\noped by the Technical University of Denmark [21]. In the PRISMAmission it has to\n\nbe evaluated as a multi-range range tracking and rendezvous sensor. To this end, it\n\nis used during the homing and rendezvous experiment, as well as for proximity\n\noperations and final approach/recede maneuvers (see Table 7.7).\n\nThe first experiment aims at evaluating the vision-based sensor capability of\n\nidentifying the target as a non-stellar object at a distance up to 500 km and to track\n\nthe target down to ranges as short as 10 m by means of a sequence of autonomous\n\nTable 7.7 Prisma vision-based navigation test phases and main sensor\n\nRange Test Mode/Main sensor\n\n10\u2013100 km Approach and rendezvous Far range mode: far range camera, LOS\n\nand range determination\n\n5\u2013100 m Proximity operations Short range mode: short range camera\n\ncooperative/non-cooperative target,\n\npose determination\n\n0\u20135 m Final approach and recede Short range mode: cooperative target,\n\npose determination\n\n278 D. Accardo et al.\n\nhttp://www.spaceportsweden.com/about-prisma.aspx\nhttp://www.spaceportsweden.com/about-prisma.aspx\n\n\napproach maneuvers. The second experiment main goal is evaluating the sensor\n\nperformance in operations relevant to in-orbit servicing, inspection and assembly\n\nmissions. In this experiment, sensor performance are tested by configuring the\n\ntarget both as a cooperative one, i.e. equipped with light emitting diodes, and as a\n\nnon-cooperative one with varying attitude and rates [18].\n\nThe vision-based sensor has been developed as an extension module of the\n\nm-Advanced Stellar Compass (mASC), a fully autonomous-high-accuracy CCD-\nbased star tracker platform, which can host from 1 to 4 Camera Head Units [21, 22].\n\nThe visual sensor designed for PRISMA is equipped with two cameras units, one\n\nfor far range operations (down to about 100 m from the target) and the other for\n\nshort range operations (from about 500 m down to a few centimeters).\n\nThis design allows performing the experiments described above. The far range\n\ncamera is a standard Camera Head Unit, basically a star tracker. Indeed, for large\n\nseparations the target is imaged as a point source, like the stars.\n\nBy image processing techniques, the sensor can discriminate the target from the\n\nstars on the background, thus determining the direction to it with about 3 arcsec.\n\naccuracy [22]. As the inter-satellite separation reduces (up to about 100 m), the\n\ntarget becomes more extended and luminous, so that the stars cannot be detected\n\nanymore. The sensor then provides the direction and the distance to the target.\n\nWhen the target image on the focal plane is large enough (at separations < 100 m),\nthe sensor starts determining also the pose with respect to the target by using the\n\nshort range camera, that is a camera head with modified focal length, iris and\n\nelectronic shutter, to allow operations in close proximity.\n\nRegarding the pose determination in short range, as previously outlined the\n\ntarget can act both as a cooperative one and as a non-cooperative one. In the first\n\ncase, it is expected that the relative pose is computed with centimeter-level accu-\n\nracy in relative position and better than 1? in relative attitude (in all axes) by\nimaging a set of coplanar Light Emitting Diodes (LED) installed on the target\n\ninto a unique, asymmetric non-collinear pattern on each panel [21]. The pose is then\n\ndetermined as the solution of the Perspective 4 Point problem [21, 22], which will\n\nbe described in the following sections. In the second case, the relative attitude and\n\nposition are determined by using target feature tracking and searching for the rigid\n\ntransformation matching the acquired images to a target 3D model stored on board\n\n[22]. The relative navigation solution in this case is expected to be less accurate\n\nand more dependent on the illumination conditions. Specifically, it is expected\n\nthat the position accuracy is about ten times worse and the pose accuracy is about\n\nfive time worse.\n\n7.3 Image Processing Algorithms and Techniques\n\nThis section presents the image processing techniques and algorithms that are\n\ncommonly adopted to estimate the relative pose between two space platforms by\n\nexploiting images acquired onboard using an electro-optical camera. In the reference\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 279\n\n\n\nmodel, the camera is equipped with an Image Forming System that comprises optics\n\nand an image array detector. The detector is formed by several elementary sensing\n\nelements called pixels that are arranged in rectangular arrays formed by rows and\n\ncolumns. Each pixel is capable to output a signal that is proportional to the total\n\nenergy of photons in the camera spectral waveband that impacted its surface during a\n\npreset exposure time. Of course, this signal is corrupted by noise that is determined\n\nby several sources such as dark current, photon noise and fixed pattern noise [23]. The\n\nnoise level depends on the quality of the whole Image Forming System.\n\nIn Pixel Size limited imaging systems each pixel measures the energy within a\n\nspecific Istantaneous Field of View (IFOV), i.e. a rectangular solid angle, that is\n\nintegrated in the whole Field of View (FOV). This is the most diffused camera\n\nconfiguration. In the less common case of Diffraction Limited imaging systems, the\n\nIFOV is determined by the size of the optics diffraction blur that is larger than the\n\nsize of a single pixel. Several technologies have been developed to manufacture\n\narray photodetectors such as Charge Couple Device (CCD) and Complementary\n\nMetal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) for visible and Near Infra-Red wavebands\n\nwhereas Micro Bolometers are available for Thermal Infra-Red wavebands [23]. It\n\nis worth noting that particular attention must be given to select a proper photode-\n\ntector for space electro-optical systems, since they are very sensitive also to\n\nelectromagnetic input in other wavelengths such as X-rays. The effect of this\n\ninput can determine unwanted degradation of image processing performances\n\nbecause of the presence of blank pixels [24].\n\nIn general, the type of image processing techniques described here are indepen-\n\ndent on camera spectral waveband. Notwithstanding, the camera works as a\n\nradiated energy sensor rather than a scattered energy sensor as the waveband\n\nmoves toward Infra Red. As a consequence, images tend to be thermal maps rather\n\nthan scattering maps as it is for the visual wavebands.\n\n7.3.1 Assumptions\n\nIn this section the type of image considered is a grayscale image, i.e. an image that\n\nis given by digitizing the signal output of each pixel so that it is associated to a\n\nspecific level in a scale of gray tones from white to black. Color images will be not\n\nconsidered in this section since no visible waveband color camera has been found in\n\nthe references that is adopted for visual based relative navigation in space. Color\n\nimages are obtained by superimposing Bayer filter mosaic over photodetector array\n\npixels with alternate passing waveband in red, green, and blue light [25]. Full color\n\nimages are obtained by Bayer pattern images by demosaicing. Indeed, the informa-\n\ntion about spectral distribution of incoming light can be useful to recognize objects\n\nin the image but it does not affect the process of selecting pixel of interest from\n\nbackground that is the main task of image processing. Grayscale images can always\n\nbe derived by color images by averaging the intensities on three contiguous pixels.\n\n280 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the image is digitized means that the voltage values measured by\n\neach pixel are processed by sampling, quantization, and coding.\n\nFor a 2D image, both spatial and temporal sampling must be considered. Spatial\n\nsampling means that the voltage measured in each pixel is associated to the position\n\nof its center. Temporal sampling means that the measured pixel intensity is\n\nassociated to a specific time in its exposure interval.\n\nThe effect of quantization results in that the continuous value measured in each\n\npixel is set equal to a discrete level chosen in a finite set of values from darkest\n\nvalue, i.e. black, to brightest one, i.e. white. If the distribution of levels is uniform\n\nwith light intensity then \u201clinear quantization\u201d is applied. In many cases, a logarith-\n\nmic distribution of levels with light intensity is applied in order to increase the\n\nnumber of levels at darkest luminosity values [26]. The grayscale resolution of an\n\nimage is given by the number L of different levels available. Usually, it is deter-\nmined by giving the number N of bits that are needed to store the information in a\nCPU. The following expression correlates L to N:\n\nL \u00bc 2N (7.1)\n\nA grayscale image is composed by an array of integers Ii,j that represent the\ndigital values associated to the intensity of light that impacts on the pixel surface\n\nduring the exposure time. As a consequence, the digital image formation process is\n\nthe result of three integration processes:\n\n1. Spectral integration, i.e. Ii,j is proportional to the spectral integral on the spectral\nwaveband of the photodetector;\n\n2. Spatial integration, i.e. Ii,j is proportional to the spatial integral of the local\nintensities measured in each point of its surface;\n\n3. Time integration, i.e. Ii,j is proportional to the time integral during the exposure\ntime.\n\nIn real systems, the effect of noise and distortions must be estimated. A detailed\n\ndiscussion about these effects can be found in the references [23]. We have\n\nenvironmental distortions and optics distortions. The first ones are determined by\n\nenvironmental conditions such as temperature, wet or foggy weather in the Earth\n\natmosphere but also by X-rays and Cosmic Rays in the Outer Space. In particular,\n\nX-rays can determine the unwanted phenomenon of blank pixels [24]. Optics\n\ndistortions are forms of optical aberrations that are determined by imperfections\n\nin manufacturing lenses. The effect of distortions is to transform straight lines into\n\ncurved lines in the images. The most common types of aberrations are pincushion\n\naberration and barrel aberration [23]. It is worth noting that also lens glass trans-\n\nparency properties degrades with space radiation doses. For this reason, a proper\n\ndoping of glass is performed to reduce darkening [24].\n\nFinally, photodetector noise must be considered. Two main noise sources are\n\nconsidered [23]:\n\n\u2013 A random noise that is called shot noise. This name is determined by the fact that\n\nit is generated by random motion of particles such as photons or electrons that\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 281\n\n\n\ncan be modeled by Poisson or shot distribution, for a single particle. Anyway, the\n\noverall effect can be modeled by means of a Gaussian distribution when the\n\nnumber of particles becomes large enough. It can be divided into:\n\n\u2022 Photon noise if it is determined by the random motion of photons. This type\n\nof noise is due to photons that are not generated by imaged objects or\n\nbackground but from other sources;\n\n\u2022 Dark current if it is determined by the random motion of electrons inside\n\nphotodetector readout electronics.\n\n\u2013 The Fixed Pattern Noise, i.e. the bias noise of each pixel that determines a fixed\n\npattern in the whole array.\n\nIn general, nominal photodetector noise is handled by keeping its magnitude\n\nwithin the first level during quantization. Indeed, several issues can determine a\n\nperformance degradation such increasing the level of noise as it happens for thermal\n\neffects and electrostatic effects.\n\n7.3.2 General Form of Image Processing Algorithm\n\nImage processing techniques aim at extracting information about the localization in\n\nthe image of a specific object S that is supposed to be contained in a single image\nacquired by an electro-optical camera. In particular, Fig. 7.4 reports the typical flow\n\nchart of an image processing algorithm. It accepts as input a grayscale image and it\n\nreturns as output a list of p detected segments. Each segment is formed by an\n\nsegment identifier Ok with k \u00bc 1,. . .,p and by a list of qk pixel coordinates x(i,j)k,l\nfor each rk \u00bc 1,. . .,qk. that form a connected set of pixels. Hopefully, once image\nprocessing has been performed at least one segment has been detected in the image.\n\nIf more than one segment is detected, a proper strategy must be addressed to find out\n\nhow many segments Ok can be associated to S. In general, a customized strategy\nmust be defined in each case. Some common strategies perform the recognition of S\nby inference on the measured size of detected segments and the distribution of\n\ngeometric invariants [27]. Also information about the thermal signature or the color\n\ni row index in the image array i=1,..,n; \nj column index in the image array j=1,\u2026,m; \nk segment index in the list of segments detected in the image k=1,\u2026,p; \nrk pixel index in the list of pixels of segment k rk=1,\u2026,qk;\n\nImage processingImage\nIi,j\n\nList of segments\nOk\n\nList of pixels for\neach segment\n\nx(i,j)k,l\n\nFig. 7.4 Typical flow chart of image processing algorithm\n\n282 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nof the segment can be used to this aim, if a thermal or a color camera are used. Since\n\nnone of currently available image processing techniques is perfect in terms of\n\nobject detection performance, a residual error must always be accepted. In case\n\nimage processing fails to detect an object that is actually present in the image, then a\n\nmissed detection event is determined. Conversely, a false match occurs when S is\nassociated to a segment Ok that is not the true image of S.\n\nThree main image processing categories are available to address the above\n\ndescribed task, such as:\n\n1. Image segmentation by binarization and labeling. This algorithm recognizes a\n\nmultiple set of pixels as segments. Each segment is associated to a selected\n\nidentifier or label so that it can be effectively analyzed in order to be associated\n\nto an object S. Segments are selected by means of image binarization and\nlabeling;\n\n2. Image segmentation by edge detection and labeling. In this case, the algorithm\n\nrecognizes as \u201cedge\u201d the pixel where a proper term that is related to the slope of\n\nthe measured digital intensities with surrounding pixels is greater than an\n\nassigned threshold. All detected edges are associated to segments;\n\n3. Image segmentation by correlation based template matching. This image\n\nprocessing techniques needs that one or more template images of the searched\n\nobject S in the same resolution of the camera are stored in the memory. The\nposition of S is located by finding the pixel with maximum of correlation\nbetween the template and the acquired image.\n\nIndeed, the first algorithm is less performing than the last one in terms of object\n\nrecognition but it is much faster in terms of computational load. The edge detection\n\nis an intermediate compromise among the others since it has average object\n\nrecognition performance and computational load. The selection of the proper\n\nsolution for a specific application will be the result of a tradeoff analysis.\n\nIn the following, the picture reported in Fig. 7.5 will be considered as reference\n\nfor the application examples of image processing techniques. It is a grayscale image\n\nof a pattern on a dark background that has been acquired by means of a commercial\n\ncamera with a resolution of 1280?800 pixels.\n\nFig. 7.5 Example image of a\n\npattern acquired by a camera\n\nfor testing image processing\n\nalgorithms\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 283\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Binarization\n\nThe binarization transforms a grayscale image into a binary image, i.e. an image\n\nwhere each pixel is given by a binary value, by applying the following rules:\n\n1. The binary value of all pixels that are associated to image background must be\nset to 0;\n\n2. The binary value of all pixels that are associated to a segment must be set to 1.\n\nFor a correct separation of background and segments a statistical analysis of\ndigital level distribution must be performed. Figure 7.6 reports the histogram of\n\nthe digital level distribution in the reference image. A large amount of pixels is\n\nwithin the digital levels from 60 to 160. They represent background pixels. In this\nimage the background seem to be distributed as a combination of two different\n\nGaussian distributions. The first one has a mean about digital level 80 whereas the\n\nsecond one has a mean about digital level 130. Indeed, this condition is given\n\nwhen background luminosity is different in two image subsections. In this case,\n\nthe background level is quite high and the quantization was not realized in the\n\nbest form. The binarization is realized by separating two regions in the histogram\n\nsuch as the region of background pixels and the region of segment pixels. This is\n\nperformed by determining the mean m and the standard deviation s of digital\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nx 10\n4\n\nDigital Level\n\nP\nix\n\nel\ns\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n\nbackground\n\nthreshold 1 threshold 2 threshold 3\n\nsegment\n\nFig. 7.6 Histogram of digital level distribution in the example image with three thresholds\n\n284 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nlevel distribution. A lower threshold t1 and an upper threshold t2 are defined as\n\nreported in (7.2):\n\n\u00f0t1 \u00bc m? ks\u00de and \u00f0t2 \u00bc m\u00fe ks\u00de (7.2)\n\nIf the value of t1 determined by means of (7.2) is less than 0 then t1 must be set\n\nto 0. If the value of t2 determined by means of (7.2) is greater than the maximum\n\ndigital level tmax then t2 must be set to tmax.\n\nThe constant k is a gain that has a critical role in determining the performance\n\nof the binarization. Common values adopted are k \u00bc 1.2 or k \u00bc 2, but\ncustomized values can be derived [28] after proper statistical analysis of images\n\nacquired during typical operating conditions. Indeed, a small value of k can\n\ndetermine a threshold that lets some background pixels to be erroneously classi-\n\nfied as segment pixels. This is the case of \u201cthreshold 1\u201d in Fig. 7.6. At the same\n\ntime, a large value of k can determine a threshold that lets some segment pixel to\n\nbe erroneously classified as background pixel. This is the case of \u201cthreshold 3\u201d in\n\nFig. 7.6. The proper value of k must identify a threshold that allows for a correct\n\nselection of pixel, as it is for \u201cthreshold 2\u201d. Figure 7.7 represents the effects of\n\nbinarization on the example image when each one of the above mentioned\n\nthresholds are selected.\n\n7.3.4 Labeling\n\nLabeling is an operation that determines the total number of segments detected in\n\nthe image and it associates the proper set of pixels to each segment. It receives in\n\ninput the binary image and it returns a matrix of integers with the same size of the\n\nimage array. In this matrix each pixel is associated to an integer that represents\n\nthe i-th segment. This operation is performed by scanning all rows and columns in\n\nthe whole binary image extracted during binarization. Each time a new pixel with a\n\nbinary value of 1 is encountered, its neighboring pixels are checked in the matrix of\n\nintegers. If one of them has been previously associated to a segment, then also the\n\nselected pixel is associated to the same segment. In case none of the surrounding\n\npixels has been already associated to a segment then a segment counter is increased\n\nby one unit and the resulting value is associated to the selected pixel in the integer\n\nmatrix. A particular attention is needed for \u201cU\u201d shaped segments. Indeed, the two\n\nvertical lines of \u201cU\u201d could have been initially associated to different segment\n\nindexes if scanning proceeds from the top of the image to its lower part. Anyway,\n\nat least a pixel will exist in the bottom of the U-shaped segment that will have two\n\nneighboring pixels that have been set to different indexes. When this event happens,\n\none of the two indexes is cancelled and the relevant pixels are set equal to the value\n\nof the other one.\n\nWhen labeling is completed, a list of segments Ok is available and S can be\ndetected, if it is present, by performing an inference on its geometric features, such\n\nas its size or the distribution of figure invariants [27].\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 285\n\n\n\n7.3.5 Edge Detection\n\nWith images with a composite background the performance of standalone\n\nbinarization can be unsatisfactory in terms of false alarms or missed detections,\n\nsince a proper strategy for selecting the threshold cannot be found. The \u201cedge\n\ndetection\u201d technique can be a suitable solution to solve this issue.\n\nThe concept behind \u201cedge detection\u201d is to search for pixels where the slope of\n\nthe digital level with respect to neighboring pixels is larger than a chosen threshold.\n\nTwo strategies were developed to find pixel with large digital level slope, such as:\n\n1. Finding a local maximum of the numerical first derivative of digital level;\n\n2. Finding a local zero crossing of the numerical second derivative of digital level.\n\nFig. 7.7 Effects of threshold\n\nselection on the binarization\n\nof images\n\n286 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nThe estimates of numerical derivatives in the images are determined by\n\nperforming a filtering transformation of the image by means of numerical convolu-\n\ntion with a proper mask M, i.e. a square matrix that has an odd order d > 2. The\nresulting 2D array of convolution named Rij is given by (7.3), in the form:\n\nRij \u00bc\nX\u00fec\na\u00bc?c\n\nX\u00fec\nb\u00bc?c\n\nMa\u00fec\u00fe1;b\u00fec\u00fe1 ? Ii\u00fea;j\u00feb\n? ?\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere Ii\u00fea;j\u00feb \u00bc 0 if one of its subscripts is less than 1 and c \u00bc d?1\u00f0 \u00de2 . A binary array\nof edges or edge map Tij can be derived by applying the following rules:\n\n1. The binary value of elements Tij that are associated to an edge must be set to 1;\n2. The binary value of all other elements must be set to 0.\n\nConsidering (7.3) the edge map Tij can be estimated by means of the rule of (7.4),\nsuch as:\n\nTij \u00bc\n\n1 if Rij ? dt\n0 if Rij < dt\n\n(\n\ncase\u00f0a\u00de ? to detect the maximum of first derivative\n1 if Rij\n\n?? ?? ? dt\n0 if Rij\n\n?? ??> dt\n(\n\ncase\u00f0b\u00de ? to detect the zero crossing of second derivative\n\n8>>>>>>>>>>><\n>>>>>>>>>>>:\n\n(7.4)\n\nwhere dt is a properly selected positive edge detection threshold. Several\ntechniques have been developed to derive the expression of matrix M. When the\nfirst derivative must be estimated, such as in case (a), the Prewitt and the Sobel\n\nsolutions are documented [26]. The Prewitt solution adopts the values reported in\n\n(7.5) for M.\n\nMhor;Pr ewitt \u00bc\n?1 ?1 ?1\n0 0 0\n\n1 1 1\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75 Mvert;Pr ewitt \u00bc\n\n?1 0 1\n?1 0 1\n?1 0 1\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75\n\nMdiag1;Pr ewitt \u00bc\n0 1 1\n\n?1 0 1\n?1 ?1 0\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75 Mdiag2;Pr ewitt \u00bc\n\n?1 ?1 0\n?1 0 1\n0 1 1\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75\n\n(7.5)\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 287\n\n\n\nwhereMhor;Pr ewitt,Mvert;Pr ewitt,Mdiag1;Pr ewitt, andMdiag2;Pr ewitt are the expressions ofM\nmatrix used to detect, respectively, horizontal, vertical, left diagonal, and right\n\ndiagonal edges. Four passes of (7.3) are needed to detect all types of edges.\n\nThe Sobel solution adopts the values reported in (7.6) for M.\n\nMhor;Sobel \u00bc\n?1 ?2 ?1\n0 0 0\n\n1 2 1\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75 Mvert;Sobelt \u00bc\n\n?1 0 1\n?2 0 2\n?1 0 1\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75\n\nMdiag1;Sobel \u00bc\n0 1 2\n\n?1 0 1\n?2 ?1 0\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75 Mdiag2;Sobel \u00bc\n\n?2 ?1 0\n?1 0 1\n0 1 2\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere Mhor;Sobel , Mvert;Sobel , Mdiag1;Sobel , and Mdiag2;Sobel are the expressions of M\nmatrix used to detect respectively horizontal, vertical, left diagonal, and right\n\ndiagonal edges. The main difference between Previtt and Sobel masks is the\n\npresence of the value 2 in the center location. This value allows for image\n\nsmoothing and provides an increase in the performance of edge detection [26].\n\nFor this reason, Sobel is in general preferred to Prewitt, since they have the same\n\ncomputational load. Figure 7.8 represents the result of edge detection by means of a\n\nSobel filter on the example image. In the case of second derivative zero-crossing\n\nedge detection, such as in case (b), the Laplacian mask is used that has the\n\nexpression reported in (7.7).\n\nMLaplacian \u00bc\n1 1 1\n\n1 ?8 1\n1 1 1\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 (7.7)\n\nAdvanced edge detection techniques, such as the one developed by Canny,\nrequire increased computational resources in terms of image preprocessing and\n\npost-binarization analysis. Conversely, they guarantee very good performances\n\nwhen complex images must be processed [26].\n\nThe searched object S can be recognized among the detected segments in the\nsame way as reported for binarization. In this case, a pixel region filling algorithm\n\nFig. 7.8 Results of edge\n\ndetection on the example\n\nimage by means of Sobel\n\nmask filter\n\n288 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\ncan be applied when closed edge perimeters are detected in order to include all the\n\npixels in the internal area before performing recognition [26].\n\n7.3.6 Correlation Based Template Matching\n\nWhen images are very noisy, even the edge detection algorithm does not ensure a\n\nsufficient level of performance. In these cases, correlation based image processing\n\ntechniques can be applied if a remarkable increase in the computational load can be\n\naccepted.\n\nTemplate matching requires that one or more sample images whk of S, i.e.\ntemplates, are stored in the memory of the image processing CPU. The template\n\nimages whk are rectangular 2D arrays that are hmax rows and kmax columns.\nObviously, the size of whk must be smaller than Iij. In order to find out the position\nof S in the image the correlation Cij between Iij and whkmust be computed by means\nof the expression reported in (7.8).\n\nCij \u00bc\nXhmax\nh\u00bc1\n\nXkmax\nk\u00bc1\n\nwh;k ? Ii\u00feh;j\u00fek\n? ?\n\n(7.8)\n\nThe limits of sums in (7.8) must be contained into the size of Iij. In case the sum\nexceeds the limits of Iij it can be padded with zeros. Equation 7.8 is similar to (7.3).\nThe main difference is the size of whk with respect to the size of M that can\ndetermine a remarkable increase in the number of computations.\n\nFor what concerns object recognition, the position(s) of S are located in the\npixels where the local maximum of Cij is larger than a selected threshold tcorr. If just\none occurrence of S is expected in the image then it can be associated to the global\nmaximum of Cij, in case it exceeds tcorr. It is worth noting that the performance of\ncorrelation Cij as determined by (7.8) can be sensitive to changes of light intensity.\nFor this reason, the normalized correlation coefficient gij is commonly used as\nreported in (7.9).\n\ngij \u00bc\nPhmax\nh\u00bc1\n\nPkmax\nk\u00bc1\n\nwh;k ? w\n? ?

The term gij will be bounded in the interval [?1, 1] and its\nmaximum is on a pixel included in the region of Ii;j that is the most similar to the\ntemplate. As for (7.8), the position(s) of S are located in the pixels where the local\nmaximum of gij is larger than a selected threshold tg.\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 289\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9 reports an example of template that has been used for testing template\n\nmatching algorithm by means of the normalized correlation coefficient on the\n\nexample image in Fig. 7.5. The resulting contour map has been reported in\n\nFig. 7.10. In this case, the position of the maximum of correlation is exactly on\n\nthe center pixel of the object.\n\nFig. 7.9 Template image of object S for applying correlation processing to the image of Fig. 7.5\n\npixel column\n\npi\nxe\n\nl r\now\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n\u20130.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFig. 7.10 Contour plot of correlation coefficient determined by performing template matching\n\nbetween the example image and the template in Fig. 7.9\n\n290 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the correlation matching is sensitive to object scaling and\n\nrotation. If the amount of scaling or rotation is known, than a proper transformation\n\ncan be applied to the template in order to correct this effect. In particular, the\n\ncorrection of scaling requires a spatial resampling of the template whereas the\n\nrotation requires a linear transformation of template by means of a rotation matrix.\n\nThe correction is much more difficult when the magnitude of scaling and/or rotation\n\nare unknown.\n\nAn advanced application of template matching can be realized by means of\n\nSequential Template Matching [29]. This technique recognizes the object in the\n\nfirst image acquired using one of the above described techniques. Subsequent\n\nframes are processed using as template a rectangular window extracted from the\n\nprevious frame that includes the largest edge detected in the recognized position\n\nof the object. This technique allows tracking objects that perform rotations or\n\nscaling at lower rates than the image processing rate used for the developed\n\nsystem.\n\n7.3.7 Notes on Computational Resources\n\nWhen the proper image processing routine has to be selected, the order of magni-\n\ntude of elementary computations needed must be known so that the required\n\nprocessing time can be predicted when a specific CPU is used. This is a critical\n\nissue for real time applications. A general rule of thumb for the presented\n\nalgorithms is summarized in the following bullets:\n\n\u2013 The number of computations needed for binarization is in the order of the size\n\nof Iij;\n\u2013 The number of computations needed for edge detection is in the order of the size\n\nof Iij times the size of M;\n\u2013 The number of computations needed for template matching by correlation is in\n\nthe order of the size of Iij times the size of gij.\n\n7.4 Pose Determination Techniques and Algorithms\n\nAs anticipated in the introduction, this section focuses on algorithms and methods\n\nto estimate relative position and attitude of a formation flying satellite on the basis\n\nof synthetic information extracted from an optical system onboard another\n\nplatform.\n\nIn general, there exists a wide literature about vision-based pose estimation and\n\nseveral techniques have been developed with main applications in the field of\n\nground robotics and virtual reality.\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 291\n\n\n\nWhen considering spaceborne applicability of these techniques, the particular\n\nfeatures of the on-orbit visual environment play a key role. In fact, the on-orbit\n\nenvironment\u2019s lack of atmosphere and rich background, that might diffuse sunlight,\n\ncreates highly contrasting scenes. When the contrast of the scene exceeds the\n\ndynamic range of the camera, then part of the image data is lost. The structures\n\nand spacecraft are often covered with loosely attached reflective materials (foil) or\n\nfeatureless thermal blankets. Such surfaces when illuminated with directional\n\nsunlight and on-board lights create shadows and specularities that pose difficult\n\nproblems for imaging cameras and vision systems [30]. Furthermore, the need of\n\nnear real-time operation with space qualified hardware poses strict requirements on\n\nthe computational burden of the pose estimation process.\n\nThe discussion that follows will briefly review the approaches and algorithms\n\nwhich have been used in space or are under consideration for future spaceborne\n\nimplementations.\n\nBefore going into these details, it is important to note that in general terms,\n\ncomplete (6 degrees of freedom) pose estimation can be carried out by vision-based\n\nsystems only at short distances, of the order of some tens of meters at most. Thus,\n\nmost of the literature about autonomous pose estimation deals with rendezvous\n\nand docking application. To be consistent with this literature, in this discussion the\n\nsatellite platforms will be referred to as \u201cchaser\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d, besides the classical\n\nwording of \u201cchief\u201d and \u201cdeputy\u201d. At larger distances, laser ranging systems can\n\nprovide range measurements, and optical sensors can be used to provide high\n\naccuracy angular information, though it can be impossible to provide an estimate\n\nof relative attitude.\n\nWithin this framework, it is interesting to discuss potential and limitations of\n\nangle-only relative navigation.\n\nObservability criteria for angles-only relative navigation are discussed in\n\nRef. [31] and can be intuitively interpreted. Basically, in close formations which\n\ncan be described with linear dynamic models such as Hill\u2019s equations [32], relative\n\nposition and velocity cannot be determined with angle measurements alone, since\n\nthe angular measurement profiles are not unique to a given set of initial conditions.\n\nFor example, two deputy satellites moving on different radial/along-track ellipses\n\nwith respect to a chief satellite on circular orbit, will produce the same angular\n\nmeasurements profile regardless of their distance from the chief (Fig. 7.11).\n\nHowever, as described in Ref. [33], angles-only measurements allow one to\n\ndetermine some geometric aspects of relative motion, i.e., the type of relative\n\ntrajectory. On the other hand, a calibrated thrust maneuver can be used to achieve\n\nrange observability [34], if its effect on relative motion is not along the line of sight.\n\nOf course, in this case position and velocity estimation are based on dynamic filtering\n\nof angular measurements. On the other hand, this strategy ismore likely to be adopted\n\nin rendezvous and docking phases rather than in formation flying missions.\n\nSeveral taxonomies can be used to classify pose estimation techniques. First of\n\nall, they can be divided into model-based and non-model-based techniques,\ndepending on whether or not an a-priori knowledge of the tracked object is assumed\n\n292 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\n[35]. Non-model-based techniques (see for example [36]) are not discussed here\n\nbecause they are of less interest for formation flying missions.\n\nIn the case of known objects, artificial targets (markers), natural features, or\n\nsurface data can be used as input for the pose estimation process.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, cooperative techniques based on markers onboard the target\n\nsatellite usually rely on more direct analytical or semi-analytical approaches, while\n\nmodel-based techniques are usually more complex, are based on iterative methods,\n\nand foresee different phases with different computational weight.\n\nFurthermore, the techniques can be broadly divided in monocular and three-\n\ndimensional. The former ones perform relative navigation on the basis of angular-\n\nonly estimates, while the latter methods are based on the use of three-dimensional\n\ninformation such as the one provided by stereovision or laser aided systems. This\n\nlatter classification will be used as a general scheme for this discussion.\n\n7.4.1 Monocular Techniques\n\nThe general theoretical framework for all the monocular techniques based on\n\nfeature points is the perspective n-point (PnP) problem, that is the problem of\ndetermining the three-dimensional position and orientation of an object relative to a\n\ncamera based on a two-dimensional image of n known points located on the\n\nobject [37].\n\nGeneral conditions for existence and uniqueness of the solution have been\n\nwidely discussed in the scientific literature and, as intuitive, depend on the number\n\nof feature points [37\u201339].\n\nBoth for a single point and for two points there are infinitely many solutions,\n\nwhich are bounded in the latter case. More interestingly to the considered applica-\n\ntion, for three non collinear points there are finitely many solutions (up to four). In\n\nradial\n\nalong-track\n\nrelative motion\nt2 > t1 t1\n\nFig. 7.11 Example of different relative orbits with the same angular measurement profile\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 293\n\n\n\nthe case of four non coplanar (three non collinear) points there are finitely many\n\nsolutions, while the problem admits a unique solution in the case of four coplanar\n\npoints (again, three non collinear). Finally, for five points the solution can be\n\nambiguous, while for six points there is a unique solution. The actual number of\n\nsolutions in practice depends on the location of the feature points and their geome-\n\ntry with respect to the vision sensor. It is also important to note that the solution\n\nsensitivity to unavoidable sensor uncertainties, and thus the actual accuracy of the\n\npose estimate, depends on the geometric configuration of the features.\n\nStanding these conditions, there are several mathematical approaches to deter-\n\nmine the problem solution (see for example [40]). For the sake of clarity, some\n\ndetails will be provided about the algorithm used in the NASA Video Guidance\n\nSensor [41], whose evolution is the AVGS, and the solution adopted onboard\n\nPRISMA for the short range cooperative mode [21].\n\nLet us first consider the case of three non collinear features imaged by a camera\n\nas depicted in Fig. 7.12.\n\nAfter image processing and feature point extraction, pixel coordinates of the\n\ncentroids can be translated in line-of-sight unit vectors by means of the intrinsic\n\nmodel of the camera, obtained by calibration [42]. The classical pinhole camera\n\nmodel is depicted in Fig. 7.13 (neglecting optical distortions).\n\n3non\ncollinear\nfeature\npoints\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nR1\nR2\n\nR3\n\nFig. 7.12 Problem geometry\n\nfor a monocular camera\n\nimaging three non collinear\n\npoints\n\nP\n\nP|\n\nYcamera\n\nXcamera\n\nZcamera\n\nfocal\ndistance\n\nprojection\ncenter\n\nprincipal\npoint\n\nimage plane\n\nFig. 7.13 Pinhole camera\n\nmodel (neglecting optical\n\ndistortions)\n\n294 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nFirst the cosine of the angle between each pair of unit vectors is determined by\n\nfinding the dot product of the vectors. Then the law of cosines is applied to derive\n\nthree non-linear equations with the ranges to each spot as unknowns:\n\nl12\n2 \u00bc R12 \u00fe R22 ? 2R1R2 cos#12 (7.10)\n\nl23\n2 \u00bc R22 \u00fe R32 ? 2R2R3 cos#23 (7.11)\n\nl13\n2 \u00bc R12 \u00fe R32 ? 2R1R3 cos#13 (7.12)\n\nWhere lij is the distance from point i to point j, known from the target geometry, Ri\nis the range from camera to spot i, and yij is the angle between unit vectors i and j.\n\nEquations 7.10, 7.11, and 7.12, form a set of three coupled non-linear equations\n\nin the unknowns R1, R2, and R3, which can be solved numerically using a non-linear\nroot solver such as the Newton\u2013Raphson method [43].\n\nOnce the unknown ranges are computed, they can then be used for relative\n\nattitude determination. In particular, the TRIAD algorithm can be adopted [44]\n\nusing as input the relative vectors R12 \u00bc R1\u2013R2 and R23 \u00bc R2\u2013R3, which are known\nin the target reference frame (known geometry) and in the camera reference frame\n\n(calculated from the range vectors). Once relative attitude is known, the position of\n\nthe center of mass of the target spacecraft can be calculated in the camera reference\n\nframe by a simple algebraic relation, that is\n\nrCRFCM \u00bc rCRFi ?MTRF!CRFrTRFPi (7.13)\n\nWith reference to Fig. 7.14 CRF indicates the camera reference frame, TRF is\nthe target reference frame, MTRF!CRF is the relative attitude matrix, i is the\nconsidered feature point, and rTRFPi is the vector from the center of mass to the feature\n\nxCRF\nyCRF\n\nzCRF\n\nriCRF\n\nriTRF\n\nrCM\n\nPi\n\nxTRF\n\nyTRF\n\nzTRF\n\nFig. 7.14 Reference frames for relative position vector computation\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 295\n\n\n\npoint i, calculated in the TRF. Precision in the relative position computation can be\nimproved by averaging over the all detected features.\n\nIf more than 3 targets are imaged, then the solution is over-determined for both\n\nrange and attitude. In fact, different solutions for ranges from camera to feature\n\npoints can be calculated which are then averaged. From the relative attitude point of\n\nview, the solution can be optimized in a least squares sense by means of the QUEST\n\nalgorithm and the elegant solution provided by Wahba [45, 46].\n\nIndeed, in the case of three features, singularities can result when the feature\n\nplane is normal to the camera line of sight [34]. Moreover, non coplanar\n\nconfigurations allow increasing sensitivity to small rotations [37, 41]. Thus, at\n\nleast four features are usually considered in practical applications to enable robust\n\npose estimation.\n\nFor example, in the AVGS system, four non-coplanar retro-reflectors are used\n\n[47], which means that four independent angular estimates are available.\n\nAgain in a monocular configuration, the solution adopted in PRISMA experi-\n\nment (short range cooperative mode) is based instead on a coplanar geometry with\n\nfive LEDs placed in a unique non-collinear pattern for each panel of the target\n\nsatellite [21]. The pose estimation process is based on the four points coplanar\n\nproblem, which, as stated above, admits a unique solution achievable for example\n\nfollowing Abidi and Chandra [47]. Thus, in general multiple pose solutions can be\n\ngenerated which are then averaged. The problem geometry is depicted in Fig. 7.15.\n\nAs before, the input data are the components in the camera reference frame of\n\nthe unit vectors corresponding to the feature points. The solution is based on the fact\n\nthat the four points and the camera center span four different tetrahedra sharing the\n\nsame base plane and the same height, h, given as the distance from the base plane to\nthe camera center.\n\nh\n4\n\ncoplanar\nnon\n\ncollinear\nfeature\npoints\n\nP1\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nR2\n\nR3\n\nR1\n\nR4\n\nFig. 7.15 Problem geometry\n\nfor a monocular camera\n\nimaging four coplanar non\n\ncollinear points\n\n296 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nConsidering the base triangle DP1P2P3 (see Fig. 7.15), its area can be calculated\nby Heron\u2019s formula as\n\nA1 \u00bc 1\n4\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ns122 \u00fe s132 \u00fe s232\u00f0 \u00de2 ? 2 s124 \u00fe s134 \u00fe s234\u00f0 \u00de\n\nq\n(7.14)\n\nwhere sij represents the (known) distance between the two points Pi and Pj.\nThen, for every tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated as a third of the\n\nproduct of the base area times the height h, or as a sixth of the parallelepiped\n\nspan of the vectors forming the tetrahedron.\n\nThus, the following equalities can be imposed:\n\nV1 \u00bc 1\n3\nA1h \u00bc 1\n\n6\nP1\n?! ? P2?!? P3?!? ???? ??? \u00bc 1\n\n6\nR1R2R3 u1\n\n!? u2!? u3!\n? ??? ?? (7.15)\n\nwhere Ri represent the (unknown) distances and ui\n!are the relevant unit vectors,\n\ncomputed from images.\n\nApplying these relations to the different tetrahedrons and combining the\n\nresulting equalities, it is possible to express the distances R2, R3, and R4, as a\nfunction of R1, as in (7.16)\n\nR2 \u00bc B3A3F2\nA3B4F1\n\nR1 (7.16)\n\nwhere Bi is twice the area of the projected triangles on the CCD (determined on the\nbasis of the unit vectors ui\n\n!) and Fi is the distance from the camera center to the\nprojected point on the CCD (evaluated from pixel coordinates corrected for lens\n\ndistortion and camera focal length).\n\nAfter some mathematics [21, 47], at the end six different analytical expressions\n\nfor each distance Ri are obtained, which can be averaged.\nIt is interesting to note that this solution method assumes that the reference\n\nbetween the projected point and which point is projected is known beforehand. In\n\ngeneral, placing the LEDs in unique asymmetric patterns will give only a single\n\nsolution where solving the six equations for Ri yields similar results.\nOnce the distances are known, relative attitude and position can be calculated as\n\nbefore (for example, relative attitude by means of the QUEST algorithm and\n\nrelative position by means of an algebraic relation).\n\nAnother general approach to relative pose estimation on the basis of feature\n\npoints and line of sight information is provided by Junkins et al. in the framework of\n\nthe studies related to VisNav [48], a relative navigation system based on active\n\ninfrared beacons and position-sensing diode technology. In the considered system,\n\nat least four measurements are used in the collinearity equations by applying a non\n\nlinear iterative Gaussian least squares processing. The algorithms can accommo-\n\ndate any number of measurements. Relative attitude is modeled by means of\n\nmodified Rodriguez parameters [49].\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 297\n\n\n\nThe iterative procedure starts by using an initial guess of relative position and\n\nattitude. Given this guess, it is possible to predict the angular position of\n\nthe beacons, and given the real measurements, the residuals can be calculated.\n\nThe correction is then computed by using a linearization of the measurement model\n\nand by imposing the minimization of the quadratic residuals. The procedure is\n\niterated until convergence.\n\nAn interesting point of this algorithm is that it provides an estimate of the error\n\ncovariance matrix in addition to its converged relative navigation estimate, which is\n\nvery useful when using this technique within a Kalman filter algorithm. In particu-\n\nlar, the covariance estimate forms part of the optimal differential correction calcu-\n\nlated during each iteration. The procedure is independent from the orientation of the\n\nline of sight vectors, but different patterns will of course influence the final\n\nmeasurement covariance.\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, algorithms for pose estimation based on\n\nknown feature points usually rely on high contrast fiducial markers installed on the\n\ntarget satellites. Of course, this limits their use to the case of cooperative targets.\n\nFurthermore, mis-detection of one or more of these markers can lead to vision\n\nsystem failure.\n\nUsing natural features and object models can alleviate these limitations, at the\n\ncost of a deep complication of the pose estimation process, especially in the\n\nmonocular case. In both monocular and 3D vision, model-based pose estimation\n\nrelies on the idea of detecting natural features, such as lines or surfaces, and\n\nmatching them with known model features, and is comprised of two phases usually\n\nbased on different algorithms: pose determination (or acquisition), and pose refine-\n\nment and tracking. Initial pose acquisition is the heaviest phase from the computa-\n\ntional point of view. Within the monocular vision framework, different techniques\n\ncan be adopted such as active appearance models [50, 51], robust principal compo-\n\nnent analysis/eigentracking [52] or simultaneous pose and correspondence deter-\n\nmination (soft-POSIT) [53].\n\nAs an example, the main idea in active appearance models is to learn a\n\nparametric function that governs the possible appearances of an object. That is, if\n\nwe can learn how to change a set of parameters in order to synthesize any desired\n\nappearance of the object, then we can find a perfect match between observed\n\nappearance (current image) and expected appearance (model). This information\n\ncan then be used to recognize the object pose [50].\n\nThe visual orbit environment, with the possible presence of shadows, specular\n\nreflections and background features, can make this process very difficult and\n\nsometimes unreliable in the monocular framework. Thus, the models are usually\n\nmade up of lines [54], which provides a good invariance to pose and illumination\n\nchanges, and edges are used as the main features extracted in the images.\n\nWhen an initial pose estimate has been produced, the pose tracking phase\n\n(which includes also pose refinement) is entered, and subsequent pose estimates\n\ncan be based on fastest algorithms. For monocular systems, edges are again used\n\nas the main features to track, and non linear optimization processes are adopted\n\nwhich provide the best alignment between edges of the projected model and edges\n\n298 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nextracted in the image. Some examples of this process are the virtual visual\n\nservoing framework [55] and the iterative reweighted least-squares formulation\n\n[35, 56].\n\n7.4.2 Three-Dimensional Techniques\n\nThree-dimensional pose estimation methods take advantage of the range informa-\n\ntion provided by laser rangefinders and/or stereo vision systems. As in the case of\n\nmonocular techniques, some methods are based on feature points provided by\n\nfiducial markers, while other techniques make use of natural features and known\n\nmodels. The approaches are thus similar, while the main advantage of 3D vision\n\nsystems is to provide a larger operation range and an increased robustness against\n\nthe challenges of the visual environment on orbit.\n\nWhen artificial markers are used, the input information for the algorithm is given\n\ndirectly by their three-dimensional coordinates in the camera reference frame.\n\nThus, as done in Ref. [57] and in a similar way to the previous sub-section, relative\n\nvectors Rij can be determined in the camera reference frame, and relative attitude\ncan be estimated for example by means of the QUEST method. Afterwards, relative\n\ntranslation is computed algebraically.\n\nWithin the model-based approaches, the availability of (dense or sparse) 3D\n\ninformation makes easier to recover the pose. Conceptually, pose estimation is still\n\ncomprised of an initial pose acquisition phase, followed by pose refinement and\n\ntracking. However, different mathematical techniques are used in the two phases\n\ncompared with monocular systems.\n\nPose determination can be described as a search within the pose space of the\n\nobject, and is formulated as a template set matching problem. The target satellite\n\nmodel is represented as a set of volumetric pixel (voxel) templates, one for each\n\npossible pose. Within a template, each voxel is assigned a binary value to indicate\n\nwhether that region is empty or occupied. The resolution of the voxel grid has to\n\nbe established on the basis of a trade-off between pose determination accuracy and\n\nsize of the pose search space (i.e., memory occupancy and computational burden\n\nof the pose acquisition process). Pose estimation methods aim at maximizing\n\nthe correlation between 3D sensed data and the voxel templates relevant to the\n\npossible object poses. In the geometric probing approach [30, 58], the set of all\n\ntemplates is composed into a binary decision tree. Each leaf node references a small\n\nnumber of templates. Each internal node references a single voxel, and has two\n\nbranches, \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d. The sub-tree branching from the \u201ctrue\u201d branch\n\ncontains the subset of templates that contain the node voxel. Conversely, the sub-\n\ntree branching from \u201cfalse\u201d branch contains the subset of templates that do not\n\ncontain the node voxel. Traversing the tree at any image location executes a\n\ngeometric probing strategy that efficiently determines a good match with the\n\ntemplate set.\n\n7 Vision Based Relative Navigation 299\n\n\n\nIn order to improve efficiency and reliability, it may be possible to reduce the\n\ndimensionality of the search space by resolving some of the degrees of freedom prior\n\nto executing the geometric probing method. For example, this can be the case of\n\nsatellites with very distinct major and minor axis, or with identifiable features which\n\ncan be reliably extracted and used to resolve some of the positional ambiguity.\n\nRegarding pose tracking, a common technique is the Iterative Closest Point\n\nalgorithm [59, 60]. The ICP algorithm is an iterative procedure minimizing the\n\ndistance between points in one set and the closest points, respectively, in the other.\n\nICP implementation can follow the subsequent steps [60]:\n\n1. Selection of the closest points between the model and the data set (the first data\n\nset is relevant to the initial pose estimation);\n\n2. Rejection of outliers;\n\n3. Computation of geometrical registration between matched data points and the\n\nmodel. This is done to minimize the mean square error between the two data sets,\n\nfollowing for example the approach shown in Ref. [61];\n\n4. Application of geometrical registration to the data;\n\n5. Termination of the iteration after convergence is reached.\n\n7.4.3 Dynamic Filtering Techniques\n\nAs for other relative navigation sensors, vision-based measurements can be used in\n\ndynamic filtering schemes to filter out sensor noise, increase data rate, improve\n\nreliability in case of loss of measurements, and enable multi-sensor data fusion.\n\nAlgorithms based on Kalman filtering are commonly used in this framework and\n\ncan be embedded in pose trackingmethods [35].Due to the non linear relation between\n\nCartesian coordinates and line of sight measurements, sub-optimal approaches\n\nsuch as the Extended Kalman Filter are used in absence of range information.\n\nEspecially when considering sensor fusion with other information sources, or\n\nthere is the necessity to cope with loss of valid measurements, the choice of the\n\ndynamic model plays an important role. Regarding position and velocity estima-\n\ntion, Hill\u2019s equations can be effectively used for near circular orbits in the case of\n\nvery short distances and relatively large measurement rate [57], while attitude\n\ndynamics equations have to be included in the dynamic model to provide relative\n\nattitude filtering [62]. Of course, more complex models of relative motion are more\n\nrobust in case of loss of measurements.\n\nAs a general consideration, since vision-based systems provide measurements in\n\nthe body reference frame, transformed measurements have to be used. This requires\n\nintroducing attitude uncertainties in the model, for example by modifying the\n\nmeasurement covariance matrix, as done in Ref. [57].\n\nAn example of the potential of the dynamic filtering is shown in Fig. 7.16, which\n\nreports results of MonteCarlo simulations (mean plus and minus one standard\n\ndeviation) relevant to a circular formation with radius 5 m, and compares errors\n\non relative position estimation as derived from an Extended Kalman Filter based on\n\n300 D. Accardo et al.\n\n\n\nHill\u2019s equations (in blue, at 10 Hz) and from stereo-vision processing (in black, at\n\n0.1 Hz), assuming an error on attitude determination for the chaser platform of\n\n0.01? (1s), compatible with the use of medium/high accuracy attitude sensors.\nDynamic filtering provides the mathematical framework for fusion of vision-\n\nbased information with other systems such as differential GPS. Within this context,\n\nit is interesting to note that also far range line of sight measurements can be very\n\nuseful for relative navigation in absence of GPS corrections, thanks to previous\n\nrange measurements integrated in a non linear filtering scheme such as an Extended\n\nKalman Filter.\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n\u20130.01\n\n\u20130.005\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\nX\n e\n\nrr\nor\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n black: stereo measurements;  blue: filter output\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n\u20130.01\n\n\u20130.005\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\nY\n e\n\nrr\nor\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n\u20130.01\n\n\u20130.005\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\ntime (s)\n\nZ\n e\n\nrr\nor\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\nFig. 7.16 Example of EKF performance (10 Hz) with 0.1 Hz stereo aiding frequency and 0.01?\n\nattitude determination error (Reprinted with permission of the American Institute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics, published in Ref.

Particular emphasis has been given to\n\nsensors and technologies validated in flight with past or present space missions.\n\nSpecifically, all the considered missions rely on two spacecrafts performing forma-\n\ntion flying and/or rendezvous and docking maneuvers to test autonomous GN&C\n\ntechnologies. One of the two satellites is equipped with cameras and, in some\n\ncases, lasers to determine the relative position and attitude of the other satellite\n\ncarrying on the external surface reflectors and/or LEDs, which can be imaged by the\n\nvision system.\n\nResults of successful missions as ETS-VII and Orbital Express have\n\ndemonstrated the capability of a vision system to compute the pose in real-time\n\nwith high accuracy when the two satellites fly in close proximity, which is relevant\n\nto the terminal approach and docking phases of on-orbit servicing missions and to\n\nformation flying applications in which the satellites fly with short separations.\n\nPreliminary flight results from the recent Prisma mission confirm that in the\n\nframework of close range relative navigation vision-based systems represent an\n\nappealing technology with a great potential in terms of autonomy, reliability, and\n\nminiaturization, with their very small power, size, mass and cost requirements.\n\nIn the near future, it is likely that robotic on-orbit servicing applications will\n\nrepresent a strong driver towards non cooperative methods which can exploit\n\nnatural satellite features thus avoiding to impose any requirements on target\n\nsatellite buses. Then, the evolution of relative navigation techniques is likely to\n\nsee a tighter integration and a more effective fusion of vision-based measurements\n\nwith other information sources such as differential GPS. This will also allow to\n\nbetter face the challenges of the on-orbit visual environment.\n\nReferences\n\n1. On-orbit Satellite Servicing Study, Project Report, NASA, Oct 2010\n\n2.

This trend is responsible for an increasing demand on\n\nmission planning and scheduling systems able to coordinate the different spacecraft\n\nand to allocate tasks amongst them. New approaches are therefore needed to handle\n\nthis new level of complexity, combining together autonomous solutions for the\n\nground and space segment. The chapter is organized as follows: after an introduc-\n\ntion on the motivations of using autonomy solutions for space missions, sect. 8.2\n\npresents a short survey on the applications of autonomy in space Operations. The\n\nsection identifies the focus of the chapter in Mission Planning and Scheduling, one\n\nthe most critical aspect for distributed mission. Section 8.3 gives the state of the art\n\nregarding mission planning and scheduling applications first on single platforms\n\nand then on distributed platforms. Section 8.4 explains the most popular technology\n\nfor distributed missions, the multi agent paradigm. The section is not meant to cover\n\nall the aspects of this technology. It focuses instead on the challenges related to the\n\nnew trends of self-organizing systems and natural-inspired approaches, techniques\n\nthat can offer promising advantages for distributed missions.\n\n8.1 Introduction\n\nIn the last decade, the interest for space missions involving multiple spacecraft is\n\nrapidly growing. They offer a number of key scientific drivers over single mono-\n\nlithic spacecraft: signal separation (e.g., large synthetic apertures), signal space\n\ncoverage (e.g., multi-point sensing) and signal combination (e.g., data fusion) [14].\n\nBeside them, distributed missions bring unique advantages also on the engineering\n\nlevel: increase of reliability and extensibility, application of economies of scale and\n\nC. Iacopino (*) \u2022 P. Palmer\nSurrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom\n\nM. D\u2019Errico (ed.), Distributed Space Missions for Earth System Monitoring,\nSpace Technology Library 31, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-8_8,\n# Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n309\n\n\n\nof new computational paradigms \u2013 concepts such as grid, cloud computing or self-\n\norganization present potentials to be applied to swarm of satellites. Distributed\n\nmissions are definitely the new trend for the space sector. Multiple platforms are\n\nindeed already largely adopted for communication, geo-location (GPS) and meteo-\n\nrology purposes. However, only recently this paradigm is showing its potentials for\n\nEarth Observation and Space Exploration.\n\nThe Earth Observation field, despite the economic downturn, will grow at a rate\n\nof 16% per year over the next decade, as showed in the research report by Market\n\nIntel Group (MiG) [34]. This is due to the miniaturisation of satellites and\n\ncorresponding reduction in cost that has opened the opportunity of many end\n\nusers to use satellite data. The Global Monitoring for Environment and Security \u2013\n\nGMES is a prime example of the global nature of Earth imaging data for interna-\n\ntional response. In this case, five ESA spacecraft devoted to Earth Observation\n\n(Sentinel-1 to Sentinel-5) need to cooperate with other existing and/or planned\n\nmissions provided by ESA, EUMETSAT, other national agencies or private\n\ncompanies such as Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) with the Disaster\n\nMonitoring constellation.\n\nDistributed space missions are usually identified by different names including\n\nconstellations, clusters and swarms. The first category is the traditional constellation\n\napproach where, to have maximum coverage, satellites are sparsely distributed and\n\ndo not require precise inter-spacecraft positioning. This solution is usually used for\n\nEarth Observation, communication, geo-location (GPS) and meteorology purposes.\n\nIn the cluster scenario, spacecraft are intentionally closely together to increase the\n\nsensing capabilities. In such a cluster, formation-flying astrodynamics, combined\n\nwith precise attitude determination and control systemsmust be used in order to avoid\n\nspacecraft collisions andmaintain the configuration. The terminology swarm satellite\n\nis broadly similar to a cluster satellite; however, the concept of swarm implies a larger\n\nnumber of spacecraft than a cluster and smaller and cheaper platforms.\n\nFor future missions large numbers of spacecraft are envisaged and hence the\n\ncurrent Operations concepts designed for individual spacecraft are not necessarily\n\ntransplantable in the context of missions such as the ANTS framework where\n\nthousands of spacecraft are envisaged. As the number of spacecraft in distributed\n\nmissions increases, it is foreseeable a decrease of the platform size. The mass of a\n\nspacecraft is going to be a critical parameter concerning the processing and\n\ncommunication capabilities. Now there is lots of interest in nanosatellites,\n\nplatforms of the order of few kilograms, as they are not anymore just technology\n\ndemonstrators but are able to achieve scientific results.\n\n8.1.1 Nanosatellite\n\nA good example of a nanosatellite is the pioneering SNAP-1 that was launched in\n\n2000 by the Surrey Space Centre weighting 6.5 kg [56]. SNAP-1 was able to\n\nperform wide area earth imaging and formation flight with a larger microsatellite\n\n310 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nTsinghua-1 launched at the same time. SNAP-1 demonstrated that nanosatellite\n\nplatforms were useful and achievable already 10 years ago. Importantly the entire\n\nmission was possible for a relatively cheap $2 million (at the time) as it was based\n\naround commercial off-the-shelf technology (COTS). Other more recent\n\nnanosatellites include MicroLink-1 (featuring redundant LEON processors and\n\n20 Gbits of EDAC SDRAM) and the ESA Munin (powered by a Texas Instrument\n\nTMS320C50). Even on low power miniature nanosatellites therefore, it is possible\n\nto incorporate reasonably powerful on board computers, which can only increase in\n\npower in future missions. Unfortunately, the same trend is not shared by the\n\ncommunication capabilities relying on antennas and RF subsystems, critical\n\nchallenges for nanosatellites.\n\nFinally, it is worth considering the CubeSat platform that has become a\n\nstandardised spacecraft configuration adopted by space researchers around the\n\nworld. CubeSats sit on the border between pico and nano classes spacecraft as\n\nthey are a standardised 10 ?10 ?10 cm cube with the weight restricted to 1 kg.\nHowever, up to three cubes can be connected together for a combined 3 kg weight,\n\nin a cuboid configuration. Example of this architecture is the mission STRaND, a\n\nfully-functionals satellite that it is going to demonstrate a number of advanced\n\ntechnologies in space, such as smartphones. Researchers around the world have\n\nfocused on developing compatible COTS technology within the mass and power\n\nconstraints, so that at this point, the actual platforms and payloads are highly\n\ncustomisable with multiple successful launches to date. It is clear however, that\n\nfor this type of platform the computational power available and the communi-\n\ncations capabilities are challenging constraints that must be carefully evaluated.\n\n8.1.2 Why Autonomy?\n\nAutonomy is a concept of growing interest, particularly relevant for distributed\n\nspace missions. An increasing number of missions is showing the feasibility and the\n\nadvantages of autonomy applications, in several aspects of mission Operations. The\n\nfollowing list points out the main motivations for such a interest:\n\n\u2022 Decrease of Operational costs \u2013 A major, often overlooked, cost of space\n\nmissions is the ongoing cost of ground control. This can account for around\n\n5% of the unit cost per year, even for the relatively simple architecture currently\n\nused. This is due to the significant resources needed by the ground station staff\n\nfor commanding the spacecraft. Consequently, it forms a large part in the overall\n\ncost of the Operations.\n\n\u2022 Efficiency/Science Return \u2013 One of the main goals of mission Operations is\n\nto ensure maximum efficiency in the use of the resources and to avoid periods of\n\ninactivity. Without some degree of autonomy, this cannot be ensured due to\n\ncommunication delay and possible failures.\n\n8 Autonomy 311\n\n\n\n\u2022 Robustness \u2013 Capability of maintaining acceptable performances under non-\n\nnominal conditions, (in case of failures).\n\n\u2022 Flexibility/Adaptability \u2013 Ability to change its behaviour according to changes\n\nin the environment. This concept would enable Goal-oriented Operations [20].\n\nThe operators have only partial information about the spacecraft state; under this\n\nnew approach, instead of sending low-level commands for each instant of time,\n\nthey communicate high-level goals to be achieved and relative deadlines.\n\n\u2022 Responsiveness \u2013 Desirable property to respond rapidly to environment changes\n\nsuch as emergencies.\n\n\u2022 Complexity handling \u2013 Autonomy is necessary to address computationally hard\n\nproblems such as distributed constraint satisfaction and decentralized optimiza-\n\ntion that are dynamically, evolving and highly complex in terms of interactions\n\nand dimensionality.\n\n\u2022 Enabling new mission concepts \u2013 Future mission scenarios, such as high-\n\nresponsive Earth Observation constellations or swarms of satellite for explora-\n\ntion mission would not be possible without a high-level autonomy.\n\nWhile autonomy should enable more complex and robust missions, it will also\n\nreduce controller workload allowing controllers to handle more spacecraft and,\n\nthanks to Goal-oriented Operations, to avoid information overload. The advantages\n\npresented above are already significant for traditional space missions but become\n\nnecessary for distributed missions where the complexity of performing mission\n\noperations increases dramatically with additional platforms.\n\n8.2 Autonomy in Space Missions\n\nAlready 10 year ago NASA proposed a roadmap for the gradual inclusion of\n\nautonomy solutions in the space missions [56]. This vision sees the following\n\nsteps to be realized in these decades: isolated on-board autonomy experiments,\n\nground based autonomy, on board autonomy (automated subsystems, AOCS), high-\n\nlevel spacecraft autonomy (flight navigation, collision avoidance, planning and\n\nFDIR) and lastly fleet spacecraft autonomy (distributed missions). This section is\n\ngoing to present a short survey on the applications of autonomy in space\n\nOperations, identifying the focus of the chapter in Mission Planning and Schedul-\n\ning, one the most critical aspect for distributed missions.\n\n8.2.1 What is Autonomy?\n\nAutonomy comes from the Greek word autonomia that means freedom to live by\none\u2019s own laws. It is actually commonly accepted as the condition or quality of\n\nbeing autonomous, self-government. This concept is translated in science as the\n\n312 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nindependence from external control. In Computer Science, the concept of autonomy\n\nis strictly connected with the field of Artificial Intelligence where it became a key\n\nelement in research subfields such as the Agents theory. An agent is indeed defined\n\nas an autonomous entity with some capabilities of perceiving the environment and\n\nacting on it to achieve its goals. Autonomy is theoretically independent by the\n\nconcept of intelligence that implies the agent\u2019s skills. An agent highly sophisticated\n\nmight be less autonomous than a simple well-defined agent able to act indepen-\n\ndently without a human user. In real situations, making a system autonomous is a\n\nvery challenging task as it means facing the uncertainty of the reality that implies\n\nthe development of intelligent software. In complex systems such as a spacecraft,\n\nthe level of autonomy becomes then strictly connected with the level of intelligence\n\nof the software. An agent by definition is supposed to be autonomous in all his\n\nfunctionalities but in reality, a system can present different degrees of autonomy/\n\nintelligence depending on the activities performed without external control. In the\n\nspace sector, the field more influenced by autonomous technologies is the\n\nOperations because it involves human operators as external control. In general, it\n\nis possible to talk about autonomy in several contexts, as the number of systems and\n\nfunctionalities involved is very high. The following list presents a short survey on\n\nthe applications of autonomy in space Operations: rover navigation, GNC, signal\n\nprocessing, maintenance and monitoring and mission planning.\n\n\u2022 Rover Navigation. Rover navigation receives lots of attention due to the\n\nincreasing number of missions sending exploratory rovers to Moon and Mars.\n\nIn this case, autonomy is involved in tracking and path planning. NASA\u2019s Mars\n\nrovers Spirit and Opportunity demonstrated autonomous navigation technologies\n\nusing four pairs of stereo cameras, as well as feedback from inertial wheel\n\nmovements. The spectacular success of the missions allowed further software\n\nmodules to be uploaded to demonstrate additional capabilities such as target\n\ntracking and global path planning. These modules are part of a the framework\n\nCLARAty, a reusable robotic software framework that supports heterogeneous\n\nrobotic platforms and integrates advanced robotic capabilities [45].\n\n\u2022 GNC. In the last years, a number of missions are successfully demonstrating\n\nautonomy solutions of increasing complexity applied to Guidance Navigation\n\nand Control (GNC). These range from orbital maintenance for a single space-\n\ncraft, PROBA-1 [54] and PROBA-2 mission [42], to rendezvous (docking) for\n\ntwo spacecraft, PRISMA [8]. Moreover a number of studies is addressing\n\nformation flying with multiple missions.\n\n\u2022 Signal Processing. Space missions, in particular for Earth Observation are\n\nconstantly increasing the size of the data acquired. The memory and processing\n\non board available follow the same trend, however the downlink bandwidth\n\ncannot be easily extended. One of the main strategies used is to compress the\n\ndata before the downlink [41]. This reduces the bandwidth needed but it can\n\nbe very computational expensive. Autonomy could decrease directly the data to\n\nbe downloaded implementing advanced on board functionalities such as target\n\nidentification, discharge of poor data such as cloudy images and bands selection\n\n8 Autonomy 313\n\n\n\nin multi-spectral sensors for specific target features. These last two functions\n\nhave been showed on the mission Earth Observing One respectively [4, 13].\n\nSimilar needs concern rover explorations, where the downlink bandwidth is not\n\nsufficient for the data collected by the rover. The Onboard Autonomous Science\n\nInvestigation System (OASIS), a NASA project, aims at carefully selecting the\n\ndata with the highest science interest for downlink [10].\n\n\u2022 Monitoring and FDIR. On ground monitoring and Fault Detection Isolation\n\nand Recovery (FDIR) are major tasks for Operations that involves thousands of\n\ntelemetries. Such amount of data is not only critical for the downlink bandwidth\n\nbut also for the analysis and the responsiveness in case of failures or anomalies.\n\nThe telemetry analysis is indeed a meticulous and time demanding process and\n\ninvolve the correlation analysis between telemetries of different sub-systems and\n\nthe correlation analysis on the temporal dimension in case of periodic anomalies\n\n[41]. The challenge is from one side to improve the tools for the analysis on\n\nground and on the other side to push most of these elaborations on board,\n\ndownloading only the telemetries that are involved on a specific anomaly. Just\n\na recent example is the mission PROBA-2 [42].\n\n\u2022 Mission Planning and Scheduling. Mission planning is a crucial activity\n\nbecause it concerns with planning and scheduling the activities of a spacecraft\n\nin the most efficient way possible to increase the science return. It can deal with\n\nproblems of high complexity (easily NP-Hard). In these cases, human operators\n\ncan only find acceptable solutions. More general fields such as Operation\n\nResearch and Automated Planning and Scheduling have developed a number\n\nof methods and techniques to handle these problems in a more efficient way.\n\nSome of these approaches are quite mature but the perspective of distributed\n\nmissions is introducing new challenges, specifically for GNC and mission planning,\n\nthe two applications more affected by the platform multiplicity. It is therefore the\n\naim of this chapter to focus on these aspects, specifically on the Mission Planning as\n\nGNC is going to be deeply explored by other chapters.\n\n8.3 Automated Mission Planning and Scheduling\n\nPlanning and scheduling spacecraft operations involves generating a sequence of\n\nspacecraft commands from a set of higher-level science and engineering goals\n\nwithout violating any system rules or constraints and optimizing the resources\n\navailable. Due to the complexity and the computation power required, historically\n\nthe responsibility for Mission Planning has remained within the Ground Segment.\n\nClear advantages such as reducing Operations cost and increasing the efficiency,\n\nare pushing this activity on board of the spacecraft. However, the single spacecraft\n\nare not able to deal with the whole complexity of the system, in particular in\n\ndistributed scenarios. As Funase [23] and Damiani [17] suggested the solution is\n\ngoing to be a separation of responsibility between the higher level task distribution\n\n314 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nand allocation mechanism done at ground segment and the lower-level localised re-\n\nplanning and scheduling performed at the space segment. The following paragraphs\n\npresent first the solutions developed for single platforms divided in on ground and\n\non board autonomy applications and then is exploring the studies concerning the\n\nmultiple platforms. A focused survey on the characteristics and differences between\n\nsingle platforms P&S systems has been provided by Moylan and Atkins [43].\n\n8.3.1 Single Platform\n\nFew solutions, highly sophisticated, have been developed for solving Planning and\n\nScheduling problems in the space context. The SPIKE scheduling system was\n\ndesigned for NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and has been used since 1990 [35].\n\nIt performs long-term schedules, typically around 1 year in duration. SPIKE has\n\nbeen adopted for a number of missions, mostly astronomy missions and now it is\n\nevolving in the system for the future James Watt Space Telescope [26]. A more\n\nadvanced planner is ASPEN (Autonomous Scheduling and Planning Environment)\n\n[11] developed by the Artificial Intelligence group at the NASA\u2019s JPL. ASPEN is a\n\nreconfigurable framework, composed of a constraint modelling language to define\n\nthe application domain, a constraint management system, a set of search strategies\n\nfor plan generation, a language for representing plan preferences and a graphical\n\ninterface for visualizing plans/schedules. The spacecraft knowledge is encoded\n\nunder seven classes: activities, parameters, parameter dependencies, temporal\n\nconstraints, reservations, resources and state variables. ASPEN adopts a local,\n\nearly-commitment, iterative search to optimize the objective functions. It has been\n\napplied to several missions such as Deep Space One (DS-1) and Earth Observing\n\nOne (EO-1) to generate baseline plans that could then be modified on board. A\n\nparallel project is the ESA APSI, aiming to create a software framework to improve\n\nthe cost-effectiveness and flexibility of development of mission planning support\n\ntool using automated planning and scheduling technology. In APSI, a given problem\n\nis represented as state variables, consistency features and a domain theory, a\n\ncollection of synchronisations and rules. The APSI framework follows a timeline-\n\nbased approach. The core comprises five layers at different reasoning abstractions:\n\nuser layer, solver layer (decomposing goals), domain management layer\n\n(maintaining a decision network), component layer and temporal layer. The last\n\none manages the temporal network. The validly of such approach has been\n\ndemonstrated in several cases of study from exploration missions such as Mars\n\nExpress to astronomy missions such as Integral and XMM-Newton [52]. In a\n\ndifferent context, Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, the system MAPGEN\n\nwas deployed in the ground segment system [5]. It is the result of integrating an\n\ninteractive activity plan editor with a constraint-based planning framework, lying on\n\na simple temporal constraint network (STN). Though this system is able to generate\n\nvalid plans, it is not performing optimization.\n\n8 Autonomy 315\n\n\n\nOn board autonomy for Mission Planning is concentrated on the ability to\n\nmodify and maintain dynamic plans for individual spacecraft. Promising results\n\nhave been achieved by missions such as the NASA DS-1 [44], launched in 1998\n\nwith the system RAX-PS [37]. This was the first mission functioning for a few days\n\ncompletely autonomously: the planner component was able to translate high-level\n\ngoals, coming from the ground segment, in plans. These plans were sent to a\n\nmultithread executioner module in charge of translating them in executable\n\ncommands for the flight systems. Lastly, a diagnosis and recovery mechanism\n\ncould monitor the execution and, if necessary, trigger failure recovery procedures.\n\nThe planner itself consisted in a search engine operating over a constraint-based\n\ntemporal database. The spacecraft constraints were codified in a domain model\n\nformed of state variables and timelines. Domain-dependent heuristics were used to\n\nspeed-up the search. NASA EO-1, launched in 2000, demonstrated the architecture\n\nASE with a new re-planning system CASPER [38]. This system implemented\n\ncontinuous planning, increasing the reactivity of the system. It was able to repair\n\na plan in case of anomaly in few seconds while the previous system RAX-PS was\n\ntaking hours. The advantage is due to the technique called iterative repair, a\nplanning approach that fixes flaws in an existing plan repeatedly until a good plan\n\nis found. Casper tries to address only the problems the anomaly introduced into the\n\ncurrent plan. RAX-PS used a backward chaining refinement search technique\n\ncombined with constraint propagation. In contrast, Casper uses local search to\n\nrefine incrementally an existing plan. The ESA demonstrator mission PROBA-\n\n2 [25] launched in 2009 focused as well on the increasing of autonomy on board,\n\ninteracting with the ground station only to download data and to upload the\n\nobservations list. Further, the FDIR component was able to handle a large amount\n\nof anomalies. Some additional theoretical studies have been carried out for instance\n\non the UK-DMC mission, the NEAT architecture was able to perform on board\n\ncontinuous planning using an evolutionary algorithm [9]. Table 8.1 summarises the\n\nbenefits of the two different paradigms.\n\nA key element that needs to be considered is the availability of the information\n\nnecessary for taking decisions. The paradigm chosen should then depend also on the\n\nlocation of such information. For example if the requirement is to make the system\n\nmore responsive to failure, than on board autonomy is the obvious direction\n\nbut if instead the system should be more reactive to user requirements, than the\n\nground segment should handle the complexity. In general both the scenarios are\n\nrequired; hence autonomy needs to be addressed either for the ground either for the\n\nTable 8.1 Benefits comparison between ground segment autonomy and on board autonomy\n\nGround autonomy On board autonomy\n\nCPU power available Reactivity to the environment\n\nSoftware flexibility Processing data without communication delay\n\nTesting procedure not impacting the mission Reduced communication to ground\n\nInteractions with operators and experts\n\nin short loop\n\nLower cost of software development\n\n316 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nspace segment. Solutions developed for individual spacecraft are not necessarily\n\ntransplantable in distributed mission contexts. In essence, the distributed missions\n\nintroduce a new element of complexity in the mission planning: the coordination\n\nmechanism between the spacecraft. This is strictly dependent on the inter-satellite\n\nlink and the computation power that are critical resource constraints. Finding the\n\nright level of sharing of responsibilities between ground and space segment is\n\none of the main challenges for future missions.\n\n8.3.2 Multiple Platform\n\nMultiple platforms are already largely adopted for communication, geo-location\n\n(GPS) and meteorology purposes. In these cases however the satellites are sparsely\n\ndistributed and do not require coordination. The new challenges come from three\n\nmain scenarios:\n\n\u2022 Cluster or swarm satellites used for remote sensing or astronomy\n\n\u2022 Swarm satellites used for space exploration\n\n\u2022 Earth Observation constellations\n\nIn the first case, signal separation and signal space coverage are the first benefits.\n\nHowever, formation-flying astrodynamics, combined with precise attitude determi-\n\nnation and control systemsmust be used in order to avoid spacecraft collisions and to\n\nmaintain the configuration. Examples of studies for future astronomy missions are:\n\nthe 2-satellites optical interferometry mission NASA ST3, the tetrahedral formation\n\nESA LISA for detecting gravitational waves or the five free-flying formation of the\n\nESA DARWIN mission designed to search for Earth-like exoplanets. Other\n\nproposals are outlined for studying space weather; more ambitiously is the project\n\nQB50, started on July 2011. It is planning to develop a network of 50 double\n\nCubeSats, separated by a few hundred kilometres and carrying identical sensors,\n\nfor the studying key constituents of the thermosphere (90\u2013320 km). In this scenario,\n\nthe challenges concern mainly relative navigation, therefore it will not further\n\nexplored in this chapter.\n\nIn the space exploration scenario, frequent and timing communications to the\n\nground can be unfeasible. The coordination problem therefore needs to be handled\n\non board. A challenging proposal exploring mission is the Autonomous Nanotech-\n\nnology Technology Swarm (ANTS) aiming to explore the solar system with\n\nswarms of thousands of picosatellites (<1 kg) [16, 32]. Nowadays work on board\nautonomous mission planning and scheduling among multiple spacecraft is still first\n\nsteps and it is an area of theoretical research. An example is the Shared Activity and\n\nCoordination model [15], where spacecraft modelled as agents negotiate with each\n\nother directly to partition the work among them. Projects such as the control system\n\nD-SpaCpanS [50] and the NASA TechSat21 [6] have shown how a hierarchical\n\nplanning architecture could be a good trade-off between excessive communications\n\nand excessive computation. The drawback in that case is the rigid role structure\n\n8 Autonomy 317\n\n\n\nbetween the satellites. A challenging mission was Three Corner Sat (3CS) [12],\n\nthree university nanosatellites with onboard science data validation, responsive re-\n\nplanning, robust execution and anomaly detection, but unfortunately it failed due to\n\na problem with the rocket during launch. The recent works are showing lots of\n\ninterest in modelling the whole system using the multi agent paradigm [2, 3, 30]. In\n\nparticular the ESA study DAFA (Distributed Agents for Autonomy) investigated\n\nthe advantages of using distributed agents in a space system [46]. It analysed\n\ndifferent scenarios, implementing two demonstrators: one for the Global Monitor-\n\ning for Environment and Security system (GMES) and one for collaborative rover\n\nexploration on Mars [1]. Similar research has been carried on considering the\n\ncurrent NASA rovers [21]. Very interesting is the approach of Tripp and Palmer\n\n[55] that applied an indirect communication system to reduce the communication\n\noverhead. The communication and computation overhead due to the coordination\n\nprocess itself is indeed the main issue that arises from these studies. It is required\n\ntherefore to consider carefully the coordination paradigm depending on the specific\n\nscenario. Van der Host [57] has recently showed the trade-off between centralized\n\nand distributed planning in front of the number of spacecraft to coordinate. Con-\n\ncluding, a key element to consider is the cost of communication link. In the case of\n\nspace exploration missions, this cost is too high or the delays are not acceptable.\n\nThis is indeed the scenario where on board autonomy is going to be extensively\n\nadopted. The main challenge in this case regards the intersatellite communication\n\nsystem, required for coordinating the platform. This aspect will be further explored\n\nin other chapters.\n\nIn the Earth Observation constellations scenario, the focus of this book, the main\n\ngoal is to satisfy efficiently the user community. The plan can be produced on\n\nground and uploaded to the whole constellation because the communication link is\n\nnot a critical resource. The level on uncertainty is quite low and this approach does\n\nnot exclude re-planning capability on board in case of failure. In this scenario\n\ntherefore, the need of autonomy is shifted from on board to the ground segment.\n\nOne of the few autonomous Operations examples that have been demonstrated\n\nin space is the tandem mission TerraSAR/TanDEM-X [39], where basic\n\nfunctionalities of automated scheduling have been implemented though without\n\noptimizing the resources. The real big challenge is coordination and optimization at\n\nthe same time. A number of studies have recently shown interest on Earth Obser-\n\nvation constellations [18, 29, 48], in particular in case of disaster management\n\n[49, 59]. Most of them try to reduce the coordination aspect to an optimization\n\nproblem and to solve it with classic techniques such as greedy [48, 59],\n\nbacktracking [29] or simple heuristics [18]. In these cases either they did not\n\nachieve efficient solutions either they considered small problems (reduced number\n\nof spacecraft). Moreover, these works did not consider the dynamics of the problem\n\nitself. This scenario is a dynamic problem. In case of the GMES or of the Charter\n\nsystem, the five ESA spacecraft devoted to Earth Observation (Sentinel-1 to\n\nSentinel-5) need to cooperate with other existing and/or planned missions provided\n\nby ESA, EUMETSAT, other national agencies or private companies such as Surrey\n\nSatellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) with the Disaster Monitoring constellation or the\n\n318 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nRapidEye constellation. Lastly, the solution envisaged needs to be particular\n\nresponsive to the requests coming from user community. The demonstrator of the\n\nDAFA study [46] aims at addressing these issues with a multi agent architecture\n\nbased on negotiation paradigm and deliberative agents. The main drawback how-\n\never is still in the lack of scalability and flexibility.\n\nThe following section is going to focus on the technologies required to model the\n\ncoordination and control aspects of such missions, specifically in the EO constella-\n\ntion scenario. As explained above, in this case the goal is to develop a system highly\n\nresponsive, adaptable to a dynamic environment and scalable to a various number\n\nof spacecraft. The technology investigated is the multi agent paradigm, as it seems\n\nthe most popular approach for meeting these requirements.\n\n8.4 Technologies for Distributed Systems: Multi Agent Systems\n\nMulti Agent Systems (MAS) is a very wide field that brings together techniques and\n\ntheories from multiple disciplines. It first appeared to solve communication prob-\n\nlem in distributed environment such as networks or Internet. Today multi agent\n\nsystems are commonly used and applied not only for communication and coordi-\n\nnation purposes but also for modelling natural systems (agent-based modelling), as\n\ncomputational model and simulation-based design. It seems to be a convenient\n\napproach in the following cases [54]:\n\n\u2022 Problems too large for a centralized agent.\n\n\u2022 Problems naturally regarded as a society of autonomous interacting components.\n\n\u2022 Information sources or expertise spatially distributed.\n\n\u2022 Performance enhancement (computational efficiency, reliability, extensibility,\n\nrobustness, maintainability, responsiveness, flexibility).\n\nThere are a number of different mechanisms that can be used to coordinate\n\ntogether multiple agents for a common purpose. These approaches are strictly\n\nconnected with the capabilities of agents that range across the spectrum from\n\nreactive to deliberative architecture [22]. Reactive agents have relatively simple\n\nrules of interaction, but the overall system behaviour that emerges shows complex-\n\nity that can be utilized to solve global objectives. Deliberative approaches are\n\ncharacterised by explicitly planning the individual behaviours of the agents in\n\nadvance. The planning can be centralised or distributed but the agents are confined\n\nto operate in a deliberate way in order to meet mission objectives. In essence, these\n\ntwo ends of the spectrum can be characterised as performing a task in a highly\n\nplanned manner (deliberative), or relying instead on an instantaneous spontaneous\n\nmanner (reactive).The reactive approach is highly suited with dynamic problems\n\nwith uncertainty. It is the most suitable for describing natural complex systems with\n\nhigh number of entities interacting with complex dynamics but is generally less\n\nefficient than the deliberative approaches and could lead to unpredictable and\n\nunstable system behaviours [36]. Deliberative approaches require large quantities\n\n8 Autonomy 319\n\n\n\nof processing power to resolve all the rules built into the plans and produce in\n\ngeneral more inflexible solutions, not able to face dynamic problems. Considering\n\nthe benefits explained above, MAS seems to be the best choice for the multiple\n\nspacecraft scenario. The majority of work on autonomous systems for spacecraft,\n\nmentioned in the previous paragraph, focused indeed on this paradigm. However,\n\nalmost all applied deliberative techniques, exemplified by methods for deliberative\n\nplanning and re-planning. The reason for this choice is mainly the higher reliability\n\nthat deliberative architectures can offer. Mission planning is a critical scenario and\n\nrequires high levels of confidence in the system outputs and performance. On the\n\nother side, the limitations of this approach badly fit with the requirements of a\n\ndistributed platform. Reactive architectures can match these requirements and,\n\nthanks to new communication paradigms and control techniques, might achieve a\n\nsuitable level of reliability to be applied to real scenarios.\n\nA discussion on the different dimensions of analysis and design of MAS is out of\n\nthe scope of this chapter. The section focuses on the challenges regarding reactive\n\narchitectures and how they can be applied to distributed platforms.\n\n8.4.1 Self-organization and Emergence\n\nThe key element behind the reactive multi agent systems is the self-organizing and\n\nemergent behaviours offered by these systems. In a swarm consisting of a large\n\nnumber of entities, the result of combining simple behaviours at local level can end\n\nin an emergent complex behaviour at the system level able to achieve significant\n\nresults. Galaxy structures, cells or organisms are just few examples. The traditional\n\nreductionist view trying to explain everything, referencing to the law governing the\n\nconstituent elements, lacks in understanding of how these phenomena arise [24].\n\nThis lack is becoming crucial in fields such as engineering that is facing problems of\n\nincreasing complexity. Holland claimed that a collection of dumb agents is often\n\nbetter suited than a single smarter one [33]. As an agent get smarter, its functional-\n\nity and flexibility reduces.\n\nThe literature does not offer a unique definition of self-organization and emer-\n\ngence and the distinction between them is indeed quite blurred. A number of\n\nauthors tried to clarify the differences and provide a precise classification, such as\n\nPrigogine, identifying emergence in dissipative structure [27], Gabbai or M\u20aculler-\nSchloer more focused on engineering aspects. Hills [31] summarized the notion of\n\nemergence as \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of the parts\u201d. This idea is resumed\n\nby DeWolf and Holvoet [19] that defined a system as self-organizing when it shows\n\nstructures or patterns at system level without a central or external authority (flock-\n\ning patterns, snow flakes, so on). The concept of emergence is instead attributed to a\n\nsystem property that arises out of the multiplicity of relatively simple interactions\n\nand that cannot be reduced as a sum of such interactions (weather, life, thought).\n\nSelf-organization and emergence are indeed concepts strictly interconnected\n\n320 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nthough in some cases they might appear as separate phenomena. In the following,\n\nthese two terms are going to be used without distinctions, except if required.\n\nAs presented, self-organization is a desirable characteristic that need to be\n\nimported in artificial systems that cope with high uncertainty and dynamic\n\nenvironments, such as distributed space missions.\n\n8.4.1.1 Design Emergence\n\nThe challenge in designing a self-organizing system is that there is no systematic\n\nway to formulate required micro-level behaviours given desired top-level macro\n\nbehaviours. Nowadays a theory of emergence is still far to be achieved. Researchers\n\nhave been experimenting with several mechanisms leading to emergent phenome-\n\nnon. The different approaches, as presented by Serugendo [51], can be divided in\n\nfour categories:\n\n\u2022 Cooperation, collective behaviour emerges as result of local cooperation and\n\nlocal handling of non-cooperative situations. In the AMAS theory [7] the agents\n\nare able to recognise cooperation failure (NCS). The local handling of NCS aims\n\nat increase the adaptability. The difficulty lies in the exhaustive list of all the\n\nNCS that might result unfeasible for a real system.\n\n\u2022 Reinforcement, dynamically modification of the agent behaviour by reinforce-\n\nment, such as reward or punishment. This approach is focused on the adaptabil-\n\nity skills of the single agent more than of the whole system.\n\n\u2022 Direct interactions, basic principles such as broadcast and localization coupled\n\nwith local interactions [40, 58]. The advantage here is the exactly known\n\noutcome of the emergent behaviour. However, it is suitable only for a limited\n\nnumber of tasks such as spatial pattern formation, topological agent placement\n\nwhere simple global equilibrium states (patterns) can be modelled in linear term.\n\n\u2022 Indirect interactions, interactions only with the environment. Stigmergy is the\n\nmost popular paradigm that has been successful applied to a number of complex\n\ntasks such as emerging pattern formation, coordination and management. It is\n\nrobust, effective and simple to implement though, because of the nonlinearities\n\ninvolved, it is not possible to have direct control of the system behaviour, but\n\nonly a statistical confidence on the results.\n\nThe research for self-organizing systems is shifting the focus of the classic AI.\n\nTraditionally, the focus has been on increasing the capabilities of one single\n\nagent while now the key element to have emerging properties is the communica-\n\ntion mechanism between the agents. Considering complex tasks such as planning\n\nand requirements such as scalability, robustness and adaptability, stigmergy\n\nlooks the most promising though, to be applied to the conservative world of\n\nSpace Operations, it needs to demonstrate reliability and efficiency. A clear\n\nmethodology for analysis and control of the emerging behaviours is therefore\n\nrequired.\n\n8 Autonomy 321\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Stigmergy\n\nThe term stigmergy has been introduced in the 1950s by the French biologist Grasse?\n\n[28]. It comes from the Greek words \u201cstigma\u201d (sign) and \u201cergon\u201d (work) indicating\n\nhow the communication mechanism is based on traces left in the environment. This\n\ninformation stored in the environment forms a field that supports agent coordination\n\nstimulating their actions. Such techniques are common in biological distributed\n\ndecentralized systems such as insect colonies where the information assumes\n\nusually the shape of pheromones. It is possible to identify two major type of\n\nstigmergy concerning whether the signs consist of special markers (e.g., phero-\n\nmone) that agents deposit in the environment \u2013 this is called marker-based\n\nstigmergy \u2013 or whether agents base their actions on the current state of the solution\n\n\u2013 sematectonic stigmergy [47]. The most popular example is the ant foraging\n\nprocess, a marker-based stigmergy. The ants looking for food deposit pheromones\n\nalong the path and they keep depositing pheromones on the way back, once they\n\nfound food. These pheromones influence the following ants to get the same path.\n\nHowever, only the shortest path will end having the strongest pheromone distribu-\n\ntion because it is the one requiring the minimum travelling time. Such a simple\n\nheuristic allows the ants to converge most of the time to the shortest path. This is an\n\nautocatalytic phenomenon based on positive feedback. It represents indeed a\n\ncollective spontaneous problem solving strategy.\n\nFrom the engineering point of view, stigmergy presents a number of attractive\n\nbenefits:\n\n\u2022 Simplicity, the system is formed by simple reactive agents with limited cogni-\n\ntion capabilities.\n\n\u2022 Scalability, it allows coordination of large numbers of simple agents without\n\ndirect communication.\n\n\u2022 Robustness, the system\u2019s performance is robust against the loss of a few\n\nindividuals.\n\n\u2022 Environmental integration, the environmental dynamics is at the same time\n\naffected by and affecting the system due to the explicit use of the environment in\n\nagent interactions.\n\nThanks to these advantages, stigmergy has become the core of two parallel\n\nresearch fields: Swarm Intelligence and System Ecosystem. Swarm Intelligence is\n\nspecifically focused on decentralized self-organizing collective behaviours natural\n\nor artificial [3]. From one side, it studies the natural models such as ant foraging,\n\nwasp differentiation, termite building nest and so on. On the other side, it applies\n\nthese models to a number of tasks: optimization, clustering, task allocation, network\n\nrouting and so on. The result is a wide spectrum of metaheuristics that aim at\n\nreusing the key features of the natural models in the artificial systems. The term\n\nmetaheuristic indicates a set of algorithmic concepts that form a general algorithm\n\nframework.\n\n322 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nA parallel approach is to applies swarm intelligence directly to multi agent\n\nsystem, developing what Parunak and Br\u20acuckner called Synthetic Ecosystem [7].\nThe aim is to provide practical engineering solutions of industrial strength. The\n\nsynthetic ecosystems approach is not applying the actual social animal coordination\n\nmechanisms; rather it seeks to capture the underlying logic of the biological\n\nsystems. Br\u20acuckner showed how to develop a manufacturing system based on\npheromone field where the industrial machines and workpieces are agents that\n\ncommunicate using pheromones such as ants. Inspired by digital pheromones,\n\nTripp and Palmer developed an on board coordination system for a cluster of\n\nsatellites [55]. He showed how stigmergy can efficiently reduce the computational\n\nand communication overhead. In the architecture adopted, the ground segment\n\ncreates the environment broadcasting all the tasks to the spacecraft with some\n\nadditional high-level aggregated information, feedback/feedforward, previously\n\nreceived from the spacecraft. The spacecraft communicates to the ground segment\n\nthe tasks executed, feedback, and the future intentions, feedforward. Such a system\n\nusing the broadcast is inherently scalable and resistant to failure, although the major\n\ndisadvantage is the lack of guarantee on task completion or conflicts.\n\nConcluding, these research fields are based both on constructive paradigms\n\nwhere the agents share experience by means of pheromones. The main difference\n\nis the scope: Swarm Intelligence is focused on pure optimization while Synthetic\n\nEcosystem on coordination. In distributed systems these concepts are strictly\n\ninterconnected, both their experiences therefore need to be combined.\n\n8.4.3 Technological Challenges\n\nThe previous section introduced a new concept in Mission Planning: self-\n\norganizing multi agent systems. Though several applications have already been\n\ndeveloped, mainly using the stigmergy approach, many issues are still open. This\n\nsection is going to discuss the main technological challenges in the application of\n\nthese technologies in real critical scenarios, such distributed space missions.\n\n8.4.3.1 Methodology Principles\n\nThe traditional practices for MAS are not suitable for designing emergent systems\n\nbecause they do not include adaptation mechanisms. A clear design methodology is\n\nindeed required but so far the literature shows only a number of attempts. Some\n\nauthors suggest the use of natural models as paradigms for the agents coordination.\n\nThose models have been successfully applied to a number of problems but in\n\ngeneral, it is difficult to shape them to the specific problem requirements. Another\n\ndirection is the extrapolation from these natural models to design patters. A design\n\npattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. They help to\n\nunderstand the basic bricks able to form self-organization but they do not explain\n\n8 Autonomy 323\n\n\n\nhow to put them together. A different way is instead the evolutionary design where\n\nthe main driver of the design process is the natural selection. Obviously, the\n\nevaluation of the global behaviour requires specific technique such as simulation-\n\nbased design.\n\n8.4.3.2 Methodology Techniques\n\nIn the last years, the progress in computer technologies has given the possibility to\n\ntest extensively the system variables by means of simulations. Simulation-based\n\nDesign is part of the wider field of Agent-based Modelling aiming at describing\n\nMAS as dynamical systems. Simulation-based Design is gaining lots of attention\n\nand the number of tools and methods for MAS simulation is rapidly increasing.\n\nSuch tools offer lots of flexibility in the system design, graphical interfaces and\n\nstatistical analysis support. Interesting is the combination of Simulation-based\n\nDesign with Evolutionary Computation. The last is a technique that has been\n\nsuccessfully demonstrated in a wide number of applications including design. In\n\nthe case of MASs, each individual of the population represents a specific MAS. The\n\ndifficulty here lies in assessing the fitness of each individual. Simulating the specific\n\nMAS against a set of problems can give a score for selecting the best individuals.\n\nA parallel field facing similar issues is Evolutionary Swarm Robotics. Here the\n\nrobot controllers, representing the robot behaviours, evolve to solve a cooperative\n\ntask. Interesting works see evolving artificial neural networks robot controller for\n\ncompetitive team-game evolving behaviours such as synchronization, coordination\n\nand obstacle avoidance. This field put in evidence the importance of the evolution-\n\nary pressure represented by the fitness function that needs to drive the evolution\n\ntowards better solutions. In case of complex problems, defining the evolutionary\n\npressure is extremely challenging. It seems indeed premature to talk about emer-\n\ngence design using exclusively evolutionary computation. The last is surely ade-\n\nquate for micro-evolution but not yet for macro-evolution that are the more\n\nremarkable in this contest. Concluding, the design process of self-organizing\n\nsystems still lacks of clear guidelines, leaving the designers with a wide number\n\nof decisions to take. The simulation-based design and its evolutionary extension are\n\npowerful tools but are still trial and error processes, requiring a high amount of time\n\nand computational resources. Even on the ground segment, the computational\n\nresources are not so prominent. Interesting results might come from the description\n\nof these systems as dynamical systems. This type of description might be able\n\nto model the nonlinear dynamics that characterize the system emergence and to\n\nidentify the relative equilibrium points. However, they are still premature studies.\n\n8.4.3.3 Controlled Emergence\n\nThe goal of self-organizing systems is not only to organize themselves but to yield\n\nstructures that solve engineering problems. The idea of controlling something such\n\n324 C. Iacopino and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nas emergence seems nonsense and in fact, it is still in its infancies. However, for\n\nengineering applications this is a priority and for space Operations a critical issue.\n\nParunak was the first rising the problem and suggesting two possible methods:\n\nspecialised agents or shaping the system envelope [51]. Concerning the first, a\n\nnumber of projects have showed how to increase the reliability of these systems.\n\nThe Autonomic Computing field for example has been promoting the Manager\n\narchitecture where a specific component is in charge to monitor the global dynamic\n\nand to intervene by global parameters. Analogous is the approach of Organic\n\nComputer, the Observer/Controller Architecture, where this special role is played\n\nby a component called Observer. Both these two approaches have been criticized as\n\nthey reintroduce the usual centralized control loop in an architecture that is\n\ndecentralized by definition. Other researches have shown how it is possible to\n\nmodel the global dynamics using a number of agents with different behaviours,\n\ncalled antagonist agents, that using negative feedback are able to inhibit the action\n\nof the canonical agents.\n\nThe method of shaping the system envelope recalls the approach of modelling\n\nthe system as a nonlinear dynamical system and describing its behaviours using\n\nchaotic dynamics. In this way, it would be possible to directly control and shape the\n\nequilibrium points. This approach could be very powerful but might result difficult\n\nto apply to real system. So far, the only works published in this direction regards\n\nnatural systems such as swarms, ant colonies that can be described as chaotic\n\nsystems.\n\n8.4.3.4 Hybrid Architecture\n\nAnother promising technology is the combination of deliberative and reactive agents\n\nin the same population. Several hybrid approaches have been presented in literature\n\nbut this field is premature. The challenge here is to exploit properly the advantages\n\nthat the two paradigms can offer: the deliberative agent is appropriate for exploiting\n\na well-defined problem in efficient way while the reactive agent because of his fast\n\nreasoning and planning is more suitable for exploration tasks in dynamic\n\nenvironments. These two capabilities if well combined could offer incredible flexi-\n\nble and powerful solutions. Such a system could be used for monitoring transient\n\nunpredictable events (e.g. fire outbursts detection) where a great reactivity is\n\nrequired either at local level (spacecraft) either at global level (constellation). This\n\nduality is reflected in the wider trade-off optimization versus adaptation. The\n\nadaptation properties required in distributed space applications are not only confined\n\nto re-planning but they regard a more general ability to change the global behaviour\n\naccording to the environment. The issue is that normally a software more flexible\n\nand adaptable is inevitably less efficient and optimized. Independently from the\n\nspecific technology chosen (multi agent, etc.), it is necessary to evaluate this trade-\n\noff: high-level of adaptation whilst ensuring that the schedule is always valid and\n\noptimized, even in dynamic and uncertain environment.\n\n8 Autonomy 325\n\n\n\n8.5 Conclusions\n\nThe distributed mission scenario presents new challenges for the autonomy\n\nsolutions. They need to be highly responsive, adaptable to face dynamic\n\nenvironments and scalable to a various number of spacecraft. Today a number of\n\nadvanced technologies are available for meeting these requirements but they need\n\nfurther development to achieve a suitable reliability. The progress in computer\n\ntechnologies is opening the possibilities of these advanced technologies even to\n\nmultiple platforms formed by nanosatellite.\n\nThe solution identified is going to be the sharing of mission planning activities\n\nbetween the ground segment and the satellites. While each spacecraft is in charge of\n\nplanning its own image acquisition schedule, the ground is in charge of\n\ncoordinating the workload of the whole constellation [30]. Ground segment auton-\n\nomy is necessary to avoid conflicts at global level, to monitor and support the on\n\nboard autonomous process while on board autonomy is necessary to increase the\n\nreactivity of the spacecraft toward transient events sensed by the spacecraft itself.\n\nFinding the right level of sharing of responsibilities between ground and space\n\nsegment is one of the main challenges for future missions.\n\nDespite the technological challenges, the biggest challenges come from the\n\nhuman side. Autonomy and specifically goal-oriented operations reduces the low-\n\nlevel control of the human operators giving a higher view of the spacecraft status.\n\nOne challenge is making this transition acceptable. This can be achieved offering a\n\nnumber of tools able to display goals, plans and plan execution status. They must\n\nindicate deviations from the plan and any corrective actions the system takes. They\n\nhave to cluster the low-level commands and summarize them as a single event,\n\nallowing data mining on the same telemetry. The human operator needs to become\n\na supervisor and needs powerful tools for this task.\n\nA second big challenge is the mindset shit. The space sector and in particular the\n\nOperations is quite resilient to new approaches because is strongly adverse to the\n\nrisk of failure. In this case, the issue is to shift from a deterministic to a nondeter-\n\nministic engineer design, but if distributed missions is the future it must be accepted\n\nand embraced. Of course, it may take some time for the collective mindset to shift\n\nfrom the current rigid and inflexible guaranteed approach towards a more reactive\n\nand probabilistic system and one of the challenges is indeed the creation of a\n\nroadmap to make this process feasible.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In the case of cooperative satellite\n\nformations, differential GPS, radiofrequency and optical navigation techniques\n\nhave been demonstrated as viable approaches for relative navigation on a number\n\nof recent space missions. Future challenges include accurate relative navigation and\n\npositioning in six degrees of freedom, with the limited power and computational\n\nresources of small satellites. This article explains the relative navigation\n\nrequirements and their dependency on the space applications. The software and\n\nhardware challenges on relative navigation for future satellite formations are also\n\ndescribed.\n\n9.1 Introduction\n\nThere is an increased interest in the space community for space missions requiring\n\nrelative navigation for various applications such as docking, in-orbit servicing, the\n\ninspection of non cooperative satellites and more generally formation flying.\n\nSatellite formations are being proposed for an increasingly wide range of space\n\nmissions including in-orbit inspection, SAR interferometry, gravimetry, and vari-\n\nous science applications. Small satellites are being increasingly proposed to carry\n\nout such formation flying missions, because of the increase in their capabilities in\n\nrecent years as well as their lower cost of development and launch.\n\nHowever, the requirements on these satellite formations are rapidly evolving and\n\nincreasingly challenging. The relative navigation challenges vary with the type of\n\nmission.\n\nN. Horri, Ph.D. (*) \u2022 P.

In the case of inspection missions, the accuracy requirement\n\nis still significant but less stringent. The main challenges for current inspection\n\nmissions [2\u20135] are the provision of continuous and reliable relative navigation\n\ninformation with the limited power and computational resources onboard small\n\nsatellites. In close satellite formations, the emphasis is generally on relative position\n\nknowledge rather than absolute position knowledge, which sometimes implies the\n\nneed for specific relative navigation software. Relative position determination for\n\nsuch missions requires specific relative navigation sensors [3].\n\nIn future satellite formations, relative attitude control will also be needed to\n\nmeet system level requirements. More generally, satellite formations will require\n\nautonomous guidance, navigation and control [5\u20137]. This implies less reliance on\n\ncommunications with the ground and more emphasis on inter-satellite links. In\n\nparticular, satellites will be required to autonomously avoid collisions, which are\n\nlikely in the case of close formations.\n\nThe main technologies of relative navigation are GPS/GNSS based receivers,\n\nradiofrequency (RF) transceivers and optical navigation sensors. The PRISMA\n\nmission developed by the Swedish Space Corporation is of particular interest\n\nbecause it flew all three types of sensors [2, 3, 8]. A technology based on the\n\nuse of pulsars has also been recently proposed but has not yet been flight proven\n\n[9]. Other types of sensors, which have been used for interplanetary landers, such\n\nas lidar, can also be envisioned for certain relative navigation phases, from\n\nmedium to large separation distances. Future formation flying missions may\n\nrequire the combined use of several types of relative navigation sensors. There\n\nis therefore a need for algorithms allowing for the fusion of data from different\n\ntypes of sensors.\n\nIn the case of formations of multiple satellites, there is also an increasing\n\nrequirement for strategies of fault detection, isolation and recovery under various\n\nscenarios such as gradual degradation of performance or even the failure of one of\n\nmultiple satellites in a formation, which may have consequences when such\n\nsatellites are automatically tracked and can eventually lead to unforeseen collisions.\n\nCollision avoidance techniques are part of an autonomous orbit control software,\n\nwhich is discussed in Sect. 9.5.3.\n\nThis article is organised as follows: Sect. 9.2 introduces the relative navigation\n\ntechnologies, the relative navigation accuracy requirements are then discussed in\n\nSect. 9.3, the importance of attitude control is discussed in Sect. 9.4, while Sects. 9.5\n\nand 9.6 respectively introduce the software challenges and hardware limitations of\n\nrelative navigation.\n\n332 N. Horri and P. Palmer\n\n\n\n9.2 Technologies of Relative Navigation Sensors\n\nVarious types of absolute and relative navigation sensors can be required depending\n\non the main objectives of the mission, but also depending on the mission phases.\n\nWhile several tests or relative navigation technologies were conducted on\n\nsatellites that started on the same orbit before separation, future missions may\n\ninvolve satellites separately injected on different orbits. In this scenario, the first\n\norbital manoeuvre consists of assigning target orbits to the satellites, which can be\n\nachieved by applying velocity increments to move satellites on a drift orbits [10].\n\nGPS sensors are the obvious solution in earth orbit. This phase does not rely on\n\nrelative navigation sensors. Relative navigation sensors are activated when the\n\nsatellites are in sight and/or in communication range. From that moment, various\n\nrelative Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) modes can be entered depending\n\non the mission phases [3, 10].\n\nFor autonomous formation flying at distances ranging from tens of meters to a\n\nfew kilometres, GPS is the primary source of relative orbit measurements. Optical\n\nnavigation with long range cameras can also complement GPS receivers in this\n\nrange for objectives such as autonomous approaches.\n\nIn the case of precision proximity operations at a close range, starting from\n\n100 m, GPS is generally complemented by short range optical navigation sensors,\n\nwhen the primary mission objective is in-orbit inspection or docking. At very close\n\nrange (meters), for rendezvous operations, short range optical navigation sensors\n\n(ONS) are generally the only source of measurements [4]. RF transceivers are of\n\nparticular interest for collision avoidance and other orbital manoeuvres [3]. These\n\nvarious scenarios are summarised in Table 9.1.\n\n9.2.1 GNSS Technology\n\nGNSS navigation technology is probably the most commonly used for both abso-\n\nlute and relative navigation purposes. The first missions to use GNSS for relative\n\nnavigation were the Japanese ETS-7 formation of two satellites, followed by the\n\nTable 9.1 Relative navigation technologies for various GNC modes of a satellite formation\n\nRelative GNC mode Description Separation Key sensors\n\nAutonomous\n\nformation flying\n\nSatellites out of sight,\n\napproaching target orbit\n\nTens of meters to few\n\nkilometres and beyond\n\nGPS\n\nHoming Satellites approaching\n\nand in sight\n\nFew kilometres to few\n\nmeters\n\nONS/GPS\n\nPrecision 3D\n\noperations\n\nRelative orbit and/or\n\nattitude manoeuvres\n\n100 m to few meters GPS/ONS\n\nCollision avoidance/\n\ntransient stages\n\nAutonomous collision\n\navoidance, safe mode\n\nFew kilometres to\n\n100 meters\n\nRF/GPS\n\nFinal approach Rendezvous and docking case From zero to few meters ONS\n\n9 Relative Navigation 333\n\n\n\nformation keeping experiment between Snap-1 and Tsinghua-1, the DARTmission,\n\nEO-1. More recently, the Orbital Express formation of two satellites [11] and the\n\nATV ESA mission have demonstrated in-orbit docking. The Japanese satellite\n\nIkaros conducted a time limited in-orbit inspection of a solar sail deployment and\n\nPRISMA has demonstrated various relative orbit control scenarios, with autono-\n\nmous collision avoidance [3].\n\nWhile dual frequency receivers allow for the highest accuracy, the use of\n\nsingle frequency GPS receivers on each satellite is sufficient for most relative\n\nnavigation applications, apart from SAR interferometry. The positions of\n\nsatellites can be communicated between them. In the case of a two satellite\n\nformation, the target typically communicates its GPS measurement to the chaser\n\nsatellite, which accordingly corrects its relative motion. The use of Differential\n\nGPS, a technology initially developed for ground receivers, has recently been\n\nproven to be a viable approach, especially in terms of relative positioning\n\naccuracy. GNSS technology is however obviously only available for earth\n\norbiting spacecraft.\n\n9.2.2 RF Technology\n\nRF technology presents a relative navigation solution that can be of interest to\n\nboth earth orbiting satellites and interplanetary spacecrafts, although coarse GPS\n\nmeasurements are typically used by the RF transceiver in earth orbits. The FFRF\n\nsensor on the PRISMA mission has been a successful test of the technology [4].\n\nThis transceiver uses GPS like signals at two frequencies in the S frequency band.\n\nIt is deemed particularly appropriate for intermediate phases such as deployment,\n\norbital manoeuvres and especially for collision avoidance. It is also used for the\n\ntransition to optical metrology. It delivers a coarse but unambiguous pseudo-\n\nrange (ten times less accurate than GPS in normal operation mode) and an\n\naccurate but ambiguous carrier phase. It presents limitations in terms of cross\n\ntrack accuracy. Another issue is the need for calibration to correct for biased\n\nmeasurements. On PRISMA, these biases were corrected by using the GPS\n\nreceiver. More generally, the RF transceiver should be used in combination\n\nwith other sensors.\n\n9.2.3 Optical Navigation Sensors\n\nOptical navigation sensors are primarily used for in-orbit inspection missions and\n\nfor docking. The long range (more than 10 m) and short range imaging (below\n\n10 m) are generally performed by different dedicated cameras. The long range\n\ncameras are generally based on star sensor technology. In this case, there is a need\n\nfor use of optical navigation software, which is discussed in Sect. 9.5.1. There are a\n\n334 N. Horri and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nnumber of practical considerations to account for in the case of proximity\n\noperations or of a final approach, including plume impingement following firings\n\nfrom thrusters, which may considerably affect the accuracy of pose estimation\n\nalgorithms.\n\n9.3 Relative Navigation Accuracy Requirements\n\nThe technical specifications on relative navigation accuracy are particularly impor-\n\ntant to the overall mission design of a satellite formation, with direct implications\n\non the satellite design at system and subsystem level. These requirements depend\n\nprimarily on the application.\n\n9.3.1 Missions Requiring Very Accurate Relative Positioning\n\nThe TanDEM-X bi-static SAR interferometry mission, comprising of two satellites\n\nlaunched in June 2007 and June 2010 is due to produce SAR digital elevation maps\n\nwith an unprecedented vertical accuracy of 2 m. This corresponds to a 1 mm\n\naccuracy requirement on the baseline between the two satellites, which is also\n\nunprecedented. This mission has so far passed a 6 month test phase according to\n\nplan and has started delivering SAR images from both satellites, with a 20 km\n\nseparation. The next milestone, which is particularly interesting from a relative\n\nnavigation perspective, is generation of the digital elevation maps by keeping the\n\nsatellites in close proximity, typically a few hundred metres. This phase is due to\n\nstart later this year.\n\nTo meet this very high accuracy requirement, precise baseline determination\n\nsoftware was developed for TanDEM-X, which is based on a forward-backward\n\nfilter smoother. This filter handles both ionosphere free pseudo-range and carrier\n\nphase measurements with 1 m accuracy, requiring a sufficient number of visible\n\nGPS satellites and single difference carrier phase measurements, requiring com-\n\nmonly observed GPS satellites allowing for a much higher accuracy. Relative\n\nattitude and orbit design will therefore be of paramount importance to increase\n\nthe availability of commonly observed GPS satellites when these become available.\n\nCertain science missions also require high relative precision the maintenance of\n\nvery large baselines. One example of such a mission is the Laser Interferometer\n\nSpace antenna (LISA) satellite formation, composed of three satellites on an\n\nequilateral triangle in the same orbit as the earth to detect ripples in space-time.\n\nThis will require the use of precise relative navigation to maintain a small offset\n\nangle between the laser telescopes of all three satellites.\n\n9 Relative Navigation 335\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Missions Requiring Moderate Position Accuracy\n\nAccuracy requirements can be moderate for certain applications but their mainte-\n\nnance remains a challenge under specific technological constraints.\n\nIn the case of inspection missions, the required position knowledge is generally\n\nmoderate but careful planning of relative orbits is required to make sure that\n\nthe satellites maintains positioning requirements during inspection or relative\n\nmanoeuvring. In the case of the PRISMA mission, absolute and relative position\n\naccuracies were respectively of 2 and 0.5 m. Maintaining these accuracies in real\n\ntime is however challenging for a microsatellite with limited onboard computa-\n\ntional resources. The onboard computer on PRISMA is radiation tolerant but has\n\nlimited processing power. Orbit determination data for example can only be\n\nupdated every 30 s on that satellite and sub-metric real time relative positioning\n\naccuracies were made possible thanks to a precise orbit model.\n\nGravimetry missions are another example of satellite formations that do not\n\nrequire highly accurate relative position knowledge. There attitude control require-\n\nment is of the same order as that of medium resolution earth observation satellites.\n\nThe attitude profiles are however required to be smooth and stable. The challenge in\n\nthis case is to keep the satellites in a typical loose formation with a separation of\n\n20 km ? 500 m, while keeping the satellite under the sole effects of gravity and\ndisturbance torques for thousands of seconds [12].\n\n9.4 Relative Attitude Control Requirements\n\nWhile the relative orbit control for such systems has been widely investigated, the\n\nrelative attitude control of multiple satellites in a formation has comparatively\n\nreceived less attention. In the following, we consider two examples of mission\n\nscenarios that may require special attention in terms of relative attitude control.\n\n9.4.1 Relative Attitude Control of Multiple Satellites\n\nA number of future applications will require formations of multiple satellites. With\n\nthe increase in the number of satellites in a formation, more frequent attitude and\n\norbital manoeuvres will be required, including relative orbit reconfiguration\n\nmanoeuvres but also coordinated attitude control of multiple satellites that will\n\nhave to synchronise their attitudes to ensure formation keeping by maintaining\n\nthemselves within their respective fields of view. This will be necessary to carry out\n\ninter-satellite communications. To respond to this requirement, satellites will have\n\nto be more responsive and more power efficient at the same time.\n\n336 N. Horri and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nThe attitude control requirements will therefore have to increase in terms of\n\nagility, pointing accuracy without increasing the Attitude Determination and Con-\n\ntrol Subsystem (ADCS) share of the power budget. One way of meeting this\n\nchallenge is the development of more efficient small actuators in terms of output\n\ntorque, given a level of the energy consumption. In this context, control moment\n\ngyros appear to be worthy of being part of future technology demonstration\n\nmissions on small satellites. Another approach will be the development of advanced\n\ncontrol methods, such as optimal control, within the available computational\n\nresources.\n\nThe approaches to coordinated attitude control can either be centralised, based\n\non nearest neighbour tracking and following a centralised hierarchy, or\n\ndecentralised. The current trend is towards a decentralised control approach [13],\n\nwhereby each satellite in the formation typically interacts with neighbouring\n\nsatellites to adjust its relative pointing, without hierarchy or with multiple team\n\nhierarchy and without the need for global information about the whole formation.\n\nOne of the future challenges of decentralised control techniques for coordinated\n\nattitude control will be the maintenance of simultaneous station keeping and\n\nformation keeping objectives, within energy limitations. This suggests the need\n\nfor optimal control techniques of sufficiently low implementation complexity.\n\n9.4.2 Relative Attitude Control for In-Orbit Inspection\n\nThe attitude control software will be particularly important to future inspection\n\nmissions. In particular, to enhance the quality of relative optical navigation, relative\n\nnavigation modes such as those developed for the PRISMA mission should be\n\ncomplemented by relative attitude control modes.\n\nIn the case of an inspection mission, relative attitude control modes may in the\n\nsimplest cases consist of assigning inertial or nadir pointing objectives to maintain\n\nthe target within the field of view of the chaser, assuming the maintenance of a\n\nconventional 2:1 elliptic relative orbit. In the nadir pointing case, the chaser may for\n\nexample be equipped with a camera pointing in the inverse tangential direction,\n\nwith 90? off-pointing with respect to the Local Vertical Local Horizontal frame\n(LVLH) frame [5].\n\nHowever, if certain mission phases require the chaser to point precisely towards\n\nthe target, then a relative attitude control mode would have to be included [5] to\n\nensure such relative pointing objectives. This capability was not available on the\n\nPRISMA mission, which relied on careful selection of relative orbits, while\n\nmaintaining conventional attitude control modes such as sun and zenith pointing.\n\nWhile formations of multiple satellites should only be requested to maintain a\n\nminimum field of view between satellites, the lower level of complexity of an\n\ninspection mission with two satellites should allow for the objective of pointing\n\nprecisely in the target\u2019s direction.\n\n9 Relative Navigation 337\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Effect of Attitude Control on Relative Orbit Determination\n\nThe last two subsections addressed the importance of relative pointing to optical\n\nnavigation or to maintain inter-satellite links for formation keeping. It is some-\n\ntimes overlooked that attitude control also has a direct impact on orbit determi-\n\nnation accuracy, particularly in the case of GNSS based navigation. Indeed, the\n\nnumber of visible GPS satellites, which directly affects GPS positioning accuracy,\n\nis dependent on the satellite\u2019s attitude. The best visibility on orbit is generally\n\nachieved with an antenna pointing to the local Zenith direction, which is generally\n\nachievable in nadir pointing mode. This requirement is however in contradiction\n\nwith other objectives such as sun tracking, target tracking and other science\n\nmodes.\n\nWhen a GPS antenna deviates from Zenith, the receiver\u2019s automatic channel\n\nallocation algorithms still assume a zenith orientation for the computation of\n\nvisible satellites. The attitude deviation from Zenith will therefore cause the\n\nreceiver to neglect visible satellites and occupy free channels in an attempt to\n\nacquire out of view satellites. This problem constitutes a challenge when high\n\nposition accuracy has to be maintained for large durations. This challenge can be\n\nmet by careful mission design. A channel allocation scheme can also be useful to\n\naccount better for the actual antenna bore-sight direction [14]. A technique was\n\nalso proposed for the Can-X nanosatellite mission, which consisted of saturating\n\nthe roll spin rate of the chaser, as it was found that the number of visible GPS\n\nsatellites dropped most significantly when a maximum spin rate was reached [15].\n\n9.5 Software Challenges\n\n9.5.1 Relative Pose Estimation from Optical Imagery\n\nThe optical navigation sensors require dedicated software for the estimation or\n\nrelative positions (pose) from the available images of the target. The current\n\napproach consists of storing features of the target satellite and comparing them\n\nwith the features extracted from images to determine the pose estimate. This\n\napproach requires prior knowledge of the spacecraft to be inspected and presents\n\nchallenges in terms of accuracy for a given computational demand [4].\n\nOne alternative has been considered at the Surrey Space Centre, which consists\n\nof modelling the target as an ellipsoid or spheroid, rather than storing any\n\nfeatures of it. On the image plane, a minimum bounding ellipse, which is the\n\nprojection of the ellipsoid on the 2D image plane, is drawn around the object.\n\nThe parameters of the ellipse can then be used to estimate the pose and even the\n\nrelative orientation [16].\n\n338 N. Horri and P. Palmer\n\n\n\n9.5.2 Relative Orbit Determination Algorithms\nfrom GPS or RF Sensors\n\nThe relative positioning using differential GPS is generally based on the so called\n\nLease Squares Ambiguity Decorrelation (Lambda) method, which had proven\n\neffective for most mission scenarios. However, the PRISMA mission tested a\n\nnumber of challenging scenarios, including large attitude manoeuvres causing\n\nrapid decrease of the numbers of commonly tracked GPS satellites as well as\n\nfrequent relative orbit manoeuvres. The Lambda orbit determination method\n\n(with ambiguity resolution) failed for these scenarios. As a remedy, a forward-\n\nbackward Extended Kalman filter was used in the absence of orbit manoeuvres,\n\nwhile ambiguities were incorporated into the state vector of the Kalman filter\n\nduring orbital manoeuvres. This method was robust but came at the cost of\n\ndegraded accuracy and is only used when the ambiguity resolution does not\n\nwork. This illustrates that more advanced orbit determination algorithms are\n\nrequired for missions requiring frequent orbit and attitude manoeuvring. The RF\n\ntechnique is similar to the GPS orbit determination, except that each RF unit can\n\nalso act as a transmitter. In this case, a coarse pseudo-range measurement is\n\nobtained from the GPS coarse acquisition code, modulated in the transmitter\u2019s\n\nfrequencies, generally in S-band, before finer carrier phase measurements can be\n\nmade. The use of a dual frequency RF transceiver makes ambiguity resolution\n\npossible.\n\nOne area for research and development in the context of relative orbit determi-\n\nnation is sensor fusion. Future missions requiring relative navigation are very likely\n\nto rely on more than just one source of relative position measurement. Sensor fusion\n\npotentially allows for more accurate relative motion estimation, especially when the\n\ninformation from different types of sensors is complementary. The estimation\n\nalgorithms based on Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) can however face\n\nchallenges in the case of multi-rate measurements, especially when the most\n\naccurate sensors have significant second order terms. This might lead to misleading\n\nestimations and even divergence, making common alternatives to the EKF such as\n\nthe unscented KF worth considering [17]. Note that sensor fusion can also consist of\n\ncombining relative motion measurements with absolute inertial measurements.\n\n9.5.3 Autonomous Relative Navigation\n\nThere classical approach to satellite navigation and orbit control has traditionally\n\nbeen centralised at the ground segments, from which commands were sent by\n\noperators to initiate orbital manoeuvres and other mission critical tasks. In the\n\ncase of future satellite formations, the tasks of coordinated relative navigation can\n\nrapidly become complex and risky to fully centralise at a ground station. As an\n\n9 Relative Navigation 339\n\n\n\nalternative, satellites will be required to be more autonomous and correct their\n\npositions automatically using their onboard relative navigation software.\n\n9.5.3.1 Enabling Technologies for Autonomous Orbit Control\n\nThe solutions to onboard autonomy can either rely on inter-satellite communications\n\nor on the tracking of predefined trajectories. A number of satellite missions have\n\ndemonstrated various enabling technologies for onboard autonomy. For example,\n\nUosat-12 from the Surrey Space Centre allowed, in collaboration with Microcosm,\n\nfor the autonomous tracking of predefined trajectories. The Proba-2 satellite and the\n\nBIRD microsatellite from the German space Agency (DLR) have demonstrated\n\nenabling technologies for the onboard management of computer system failures\n\nand of attitude anomalies and other limit exceeding parameters [18]. The\n\nDEMETERmicrosatellite from the French Space Agency (CNES) has demonstrated\n\na number of autonomous orbital manoeuvring scenarios, while PRISMA also\n\ndemonstrated autonomous close proximity operations between the Mango and\n\nTango satellites. These technologies will have to be tested on formations of multiple\n\nsatellites, by taking into consideration the mission level requirements of satellite\n\nformations.\n\n9.5.3.2 Autonomous FDIR and Collision Avoidance\n\nWhile Failure Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) software was generally\n\ndedicated to the management of subsystem failures, collision avoidance should also\n\nbe part of any future FDIR system in satellite formations. Autonomous collision\n\navoidance was also demonstrated onboard PRISMA using the RF relative naviga-\n\ntion sensor.\n\nCollision avoidance is of particular importance to any mission involving\n\nproximity operations or close formations. Successful autonomous docking was\n\ndemonstrated on Orbital express [11] and on the ATV mission [19]. However, a\n\nnumber of anomalies occurred on other missions demonstrating rendezvous\n\ncapabilities, including the DART mission and the ETS-7 mission. In the case\n\nof the ETS-7 mission, such anomalies caused a number of entries into a safe\n\nmode including a pre-programmed manoeuvre to move the chaser 2.5 km away\n\nfrom the target. In the case of the DART mission, an anomaly caused excess fuel\n\nexpenditure and was suspected to have caused a collision. These examples\n\nsuggest that the inclusion of additional safeguards for collision avoidance and\n\nmore generally for FDIR software can be of great benefit to future missions\n\ninvolving proximity operations or in-orbit inspection [20]. Agent based\n\ntechniques have been proposed to autonomously perform FDIR [6]. A number\n\nof approaches have been recently developed for collision avoidance based on\n\npassive safe trajectories (without thrusting) and active safe trajectories, which is\n\nless restrictive but requires failure detection in real time. Current research in this\n\n340 N. Horri and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nfield aims to the development of fuel optimised safe trajectories [7, 21]. There\n\nare however also computational constraints to account for. The approach pro-\n\nposed in reference [21] for a multiple satellite formation is sequential and based\n\non the computation of piecewise optimal solutions, using the fact that reconfigu-\n\nration manoeuvres often do not affect other satellites in the formation. The\n\ncomputation time using this approach was shown to be considerably reduced\n\ncompared to a conventional finite element method that solves the global optimal\n\nsolution.\n\n9.6 Hardware Limitations\n\nThe decision of choosing between Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components\n\nor radiation tolerant space qualified components is one of the choices to be made at\n\nthe system design level. There is generally a compromise to be found between the\n\nneed for high performance at system and subsystem levels and the reliability of the\n\nsatellite. The enabling technologies generally have to be reliable and power effi-\n\ncient. In the following, we consider some key equipment which affects the reliabil-\n\nity and performance of relative navigation onboard small satellites.\n\n9.6.1 GPS Receiver Selection\n\nGPS receivers are the most commonly used sensors for orbit determination in earth\n\norbit. Other sensors such as those based on RF technology would generally be used\n\nin conjunction with GPS receivers, which offer a way of calibrating them in-orbit.\n\nMost small satellites fly single frequency receivers. For example, GPS receivers on\n\nthe PRISMA satellite are known not to be sufficiently radiation tolerant. This\n\nintolerance to radiations is in this case responsible for the absence of measurements\n\nduring all passes over the South Atlantic anomaly, when the GPS receiver is turned\n\noff. Latch ups were also reported to happen once every 15 days per GPS receiver on\n\nthe PRISMA mission. These relatively frequent data gaps will not be admissible for\n\nall space missions, which will require the development of radiation tolerant GPS\n\nreceivers.\n\n9.6.2 Processing Power Options\n\nThe choice of the processor is another important element in the trade-off between\n\nreliability and performance. The choice made on the Dutch-Chinese Fast formation\n\nof two satellites FAST-D and FAST-T was one of performance, to meet the high\n\nmanoeuvrability demands of relative navigation. The powerful (2GH) Intel atom\n\n9 Relative Navigation 341\n\n\n\nprocessor, with relatively low power requirements (2.5 W) was indeed the choice\n\nmade by the FAST team. This processor largely outperforms the space certified\n\nLEON3FT for example, which is limited to 4 MFLOPS (million floating point\n\noperations per second), in terms of processing power [22]. The fact that the\n\nprocessor is not fault tolerant is addressed through the application of fault tolerant\n\nsoftware, which requires an overhead. This does not completely equal the reliability\n\nof space qualified equipment but significantly reduces the cost and performance\n\nloss incurred by using space qualified hardware.\n\nThe PRISMA team on the other hand opted for higher reliability with a space\n\nqualified LEON 3 processor allowing for up to 20 MFLOPS and the onboard\n\nsoftware was designed to work within this relatively limited processing power.\n\nThe optical navigation sensor (fully autonomous), the GPS receiver (using an\n\nARM7 microcontroller) and even the radiofrequency FFRF sensor were however\n\ndeveloped with their own processing units.\n\nThe challenges ahead will include the development of more reliable COTS\n\nprocessors and data handling subsystems and/or the enhancement of the perfor-\n\nmance of flight proven processors.\n\n9.6.3 Innovative Propulsion Technologies\n\nA MEMS micro-propulsion subsystem was meant to provide low but highly\n\naccurate and continuous thrust on PRISMA, which could have added a significant\n\ncapability in terms orbit control accuracy. This micro-propulsion system failed due\n\nto a leak in the fuel tank. More conventional hydrazine thrusters were however\n\navailable to continue the relative orbit control experiments, but micro-propulsion\n\ntechnology will have to evolve in terms of reliability to meet the fine relative\n\norbit control requirements of future missions. One of the challenges will be the\n\ndevelopment of power efficient micro-propulsion technologies. In the case of\n\nmicrosatellites, conventional prolusion will still be required to provide sufficient\n\nlevel of thrust, but micro-propulsion will be of particular interest to relative GNC\n\nmodes requiring highly accurate orbit control. The ability to produce variable thrust\n\nwill also be a desirable feature and will enable the application of feedback control\n\nstrategies.\n\n9.6.4 Limitations on Nano-Satellites\n\nA number of the future planned satellite formations, such as CanX, QB-50 will be\n\ncomposed of nano-satellites or even pico-satellites. Based on the current technol-\n\nogy, these satellites have limited Attitude Determination and Control System\n\n(ADCS) Capabilities, making the prospect efficient coordinated relative attitude\n\ncontrol for example very challenging. A number of enabling technologies, such as\n\n342 N. Horri and P. Palmer\n\n\n\nmicro-wheels for three axis control are currently being developed to increase the\n\nlimited ADCS capability. Another challenge is the development of micro-\n\npropulsion based on MEMS technology for this class of satellites. There are also\n\nlimitations on the optical navigation capabilities at such small sizes, where the use\n\nof GNSS should be the main source of relative navigation data. In the case of nano-\n\nsatellite formations, less conventional mission concepts such as that of tethered\n\nspacecrafts can be of interest to certain applications, particularly when the satellites\n\nare required to maintain a close formation.\n\n9.7 Conclusions\n\nA number of technologies have been validated for relative navigation applications,\n\nincluding differential GPS, radiofrequency and optical navigation. However, due to\n\nincreasing autonomy, relative positioning and relative attitude control\n\nrequirements, future satellite formations will require further development of current\n\nrelative guidance, navigation and control techniques. These missions will require\n\nhigher measurement reliability, the fusion of data from different types of sensors\n\nand higher autonomy, while meeting system level constraints. In the case of\n\nformations of multiple satellites, there will also be a need for higher processing\n\npower, which is currently available from COTS technologies and higher attitude\n\ncontrol capability.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank Luke Sauter from the Astrodynamics group\n\nat the Surrey Space Centre for his useful advice, particularly with regards to collision avoidance.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This section provides further details for the special situation of\n\nnetwork nodes consisting of several satellites and ground stations. Via the commu-\n\nnication system partially autonomous functions at each satellite are to be coordi-\n\nnated to enable joint observations. Such self-organized activities of the space\n\nsegment have to integrate with teleoperations based on supervisory control interac-\n\ntion from ground stations. Related suitable communication design approaches are\n\nthe central topic of this chapter.\n\n10.1 Introduction\n\nDistributed satellite systems have to exchange data in the networked space segment\n\nto enable appropriate coordination for observation, also when no ground station\n\ncontact is available. By example, when the distributed instruments are to be pointed\n\nto the same target observation areas for subsequent data fusion. Further related\n\nnavigation sensor data are to be exchanged to enable coordinated observations\n\ndespite disturbances. Real-time corrective reaction capabilities are to be enabled\n\nby data acquisition via typically low bandwidth communication links, in order to\n\nincrease the quality of the obtained observation data for this satellite based sensor\n\nnetwork.\n\nAlso in the context of provision of telecommunication services, networked\n\nsatellite systems in low Earth orbits offer interesting capabilities for telecommuni-\n\ncation links at a minimum use of resources due to shorter ground contact distances.\n\nChallenges are related to significant orbit dynamics affecting the link topology and\n\nK.

Corrections of Doppler effects or even relativistic effects might be neces-\n\nsary for a sufficient communication performance.\n\nCombination of data from various networked, coordinated satellites enables\n\nprovision of high performance results despite the limitations in resources of each\n\nindividual satellite, in particular if distributed systems of small satellites are\n\nemployed. Technology challenges to implement such innovative distributed space-\n\ncraft system concepts require efficient and robust telecommunication in the space\n\nsegment for a cooperative coordination, but also between satellites and ground\n\nsegment (cf. Chap. 11). It is the emphasis of the following chapters to discuss\n\nrelated data exchange methods.\n\n10.2 Requirements for Typical Scenarios\n\nInteresting applications of distributed satellite systems are anticipated for robust\n\nlow-bandwidth communication systems, as well as for space weather and Earth\n\nobservations [1]. Interesting examples related to SAR antennae are provided in\n\nChaps. 1 and 2 of this book. In order to illustrate the broad diversity of potential\n\ndistributed space missions, here in-situ multi-point observation of space weather\n\nphenomena in the upper atmosphere is addressed by the QB50 mission [2], com-\n\nposed of 50 small satellites. Upper atmospheric layers can hardly be observed from\n\nground, as the accumulated noise effects from dense lower layers limit\n\nmeasurements, while from space only the low density layers above are to be\n\npenetrated by the instrumentation. Due to the limited lifetime of satellites in the\n\npoorly observed range between 90 and 300 km (corresponding to a survival period\n\nof hours to a month due to deceleration by atmospheric particles) expensive\n\ntraditional satellites are rarely placed at such altitudes. This opens interesting\n\nopportunities for distributed small satellites to fill these gaps of knowledge.\n\nFor multi-point observations, it is always essential to have a baseline distance\n\nbetween the different distributed sensors and to exchange data related to navigation,\n\nobservation and satellite status in order to enable appropriate reconfiguration.\n\nIn constellations all communication and coordination is channeled via a ground\n\nstation. For avoidance of degradation of observation data due to noise or drift\n\neffects between ground contact periods, direct intersatellite links are demanded to\n\nenable self-reconfiguration in orbit.\n\n10.3 Communication Concepts for Distributed Systems\n\nThe communication and tele-operation infrastructure provides a key element in\n\nestablishing distributed satellite systems. Approaches for efficient organization of\n\nthe data flow in the networked system, consisting of several satellites and ground\n\n346 K. Schilling and M. Schmidt\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-2\n\n\nstations, are addressed in this section. In distributed applications on Earth the\n\ninternet protocols TCP/IP became the established standard and attracts significant\n\ndevelopment efforts for further improvements. To benefit from terrestrial activities,\n\ntransfer of these technologies to the space environment is attractive. Space related\n\nnetwork standards are promoted by the Consultative Committee for Space Data\n\nSystems (CCSDS) (http://www.ccsds.org/). In particular adaptations to significant\n\ndelays and to higher noise levels have been included. A significant advantage for\n\nthis IP-based approach is the easy transfer of satellite data to terrestrial networks\n\nwithout any protocol conversion needs.\n\n10.3.1 Centralized/Decentralized Network Architectures\n\nThe network configurations can be based in a centralized way on \u201cservers\u201d [3], or\n\non a distributed approach based on ad-hoc networks [4]. Solutions between those\n\nextremes are by example \u201cembedded star topology\u201d [5], suitable for highly deter-\n\nministic behavior with limited node-mobility. Typical network architectures used in\n\nterrestrial context are:\n\n\u2022 Purely centralized: many wireless products support this kind of architecture\n\n(IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.11a/b/g). In order to exchange data between each\n\nother, two nodes always need to relay over another central node (e.g. base\n\nstation, access point).\n\n\u2022 Cellular systems: can be seen as a generalization of centralized systems. Inter-\n\nconnected base stations form the cell center points and soft hand-overs are to be\n\nprovided, when a mobile terminal changes from one cell to another. Typical\n\nproducts are GPRS components.\n\n\u2022 Ad-hoc networks: here every node has similar rights and does not rely on a\n\nspecial infrastructure.\n\nIn a centralized network architecture for formations, one of the satellites would\n\nserve as an access point (AP) while the others act as clients. This well accepted\n\narchitecture is sensitive to failure of the AP. Therefore functions of the AP have to\n\nbe continuously monitored and in case of a failure transfer of AP-functions to\n\nanother satellite is to be organized. This requires the AP to frequently broadcast an\n\n\u201calive\u201d message. All communication in the satellite network is relayed via the AP,\n\ncausing inefficient paths by example for neighboring clients. As the power con-\n\nsumption increases exponentially for a linear extension of the communication\n\ndistance, the energy efficiency in such centralized systems is low.\n\nCellular systems exhibit similar problems and are designed for a high number of\n\nclients being far beyond the size of present distributed satellite scenarios.\n\nIn the decentralized approach by ad-hoc networks a coordinating instance as\n\nan AP is missing for controlling medium access or for ensuring that data frames\n\narrive at their destination. This leads to reduced hardware requirements, but causes\n\nan increased software development effort. Terrestrial solutions including MANETs\n\n10 Communication in Distributed Satellite Systems 347\n\nhttp://www.ccsds.org/\n\n\n(Mobile ad-hoc Networks), VANETs (Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks) or WSNs\n\n(Wireless Sensor Networks) are well established, but still have to be adapted\n\nto the use in space. The multi-hop feature reduces communication distances and\n\nrelated energy demands.\n\n10.3.2 Internet Protocols (IP)\n\nFirst experiments related to Internet Protocols (IP) in space were performed 1999\n\nby NASA during the UoSat-12 mission. One of the first missions, totally operated\n\nonly over the TCP/IP protocol stack, was the CHIPsat mission launched in 2003\n\nfrom NASA and the Space Science Laboratory in Berkley. In 2005 the pico-satellite\n\nUWE-1 (University W\u20acurzburg\u2019s Experimental satellite) was launched with the\nmain scientific objective to optimize IP parameters in adaptation to the measured\n\nspace environment [6, 7]. UWE-1 carried the on-board data handling system m-\nLinux, implemented on a microcontroller. Thus advantage could be taken from an\n\nintegrated, appropriate IP-stack for related telecommunication experiments. The\n\nadvantages of IP and its higher layer protocols (e.g. TCP, UDP) are the world wide\n\nusage, resulting in a fully tested reliable protocol stack and a broad spectrum of\n\navailable applications using the IP interface. UWE-1 communication was based on\n\na commercial transceiver, normally used by radio amateurs for data transmission\n\nvia packet radio. The main experiments were related to cross layer optimizations\n\nbetween AX.25 and higher protocol layers (i.e. IP) and to application layer\n\nprotocols like HTTP and TFTP (cf. Fig. 10.1).\n\nA major disadvantage of the TCP/IP protocol stack is the performance problem\n\nof the TCP protocol in space conditions. As the TCP protocol was intended for\n\nusage in the terrestrial internet, a congestion avoidance algorithm decreases the\n\ntransmission rate, if congestion occurs. This behavior is an essential feature of TCP\n\nin the terrestrial internet, when the network is overloaded by traffic. A congestion\n\nsituation in the terrestrial internet is indicated by the loss of data packets. In satellite\n\nFig. 10.1 The specific\n\nimplementation of ISO/OSI\n\nreference model layers on-\n\nboard of UWE-1. Here for\n\ncomparison reasons several\n\ntransport layer alternatives\n\nwere realized\n\n348 K. Schilling and M. Schmidt\n\n\n\ncommunication the situation is totally different: loss of packets is normally caused\n\nby transmission errors, nevertheless TCP reacts in this situation with decreasing the\n\ntransmission rate. Therefore it is important to choose very carefully the communi-\n\ncation protocols. An alternative is the usage of UDP instead of TCP, a\n\nconnectionless transport protocol. In this case the application layer has to provide\n\nmechanisms to guarantee the correct reception of data packets. Another possibility\n\nis to use a TCP extension protocol, which overcomes typical problems of TCP.\n\nThe results of the UWE-1 experiments displayed, that IP communication is\n\nfeasible, but different optimizations are necessary to enable an efficient telecom-\n\nmunication between satellite and ground stations. Especially the high Packet Error\n\nRate (PER) observed on the communication link with UWE-1 affects the perfor-\n\nmance of the AX.25 protocol. The measured PER values are presented in Fig. 10.2.\n\nThe values are expressed in terms of confidence intervals, the variance of these\n\nintervals reveal the necessity to improve the combination between AX.25 and IP\n\nwith additional redundancy for the communication link. Further redundancy for the\n\ntelecommunication can be generated by hardware or by software algorithms to\n\nsolve the problems of error rates due to significant noise effects from the space\n\nenvironment.\n\n10.3.3 Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANet)\n\nRealization of robust network communications attracts significant research efforts\n\nin terrestrial applications. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANet) combines several\n\nagents to a self-organizing telecommunication network. It includes in particular\n\ninitialisation and reconfiguration capabilities for the case of defects or of changes in\n\nthe topology. Therefore in formations of satellites, exhibiting high dynamics and\n\nlink interruptions, a reliable reconfiguration capability of the communication path,\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n1-\nP\n\nE\nR\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n500 1000\n\nslant range [km]\n\n1500 3000\n?0.2\n\nFig. 10.2 UWE-1 packet\n\nerror rate (PER)\n\ndetermination for the AX.25\n\nradio link\n\n10 Communication in Distributed Satellite Systems 349\n\n\n\nemploying several agents of the space and ground segment, will increase robust-\n\nness. Related routing methods are analyzed in the following section.\n\nFor characterizing MANET performance in mobile systems at the University\n\nW\u20acurzburg\u2019s demonstrator and test facility based on WLAN (IEEE 802.11) has been\ninstalled, consisting of a system of several mobile robots and fixed stations as nodes\n\n(cf. Fig. 10.3) [8].\n\nIn this test facility experiments to prepare future MANET applications in space\n\nhave been performed with respect to re-routing performance. Typical ad-hoc\n\nrouting protocols developed for mobile systems were compared in teleoperation\n\nscenarios for mobile vehicles, including:\n\n\u2022 Reactive protocols, such as \u201cAd-Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV)\u201d or\n\n\u201cDynamic Source Routing (DSR)\u201d,\n\n\u2022 Proactive protocols, such as \u201cOptimized Link State Routing (OLSR)\u201d,\n\n\u2022 Hybrid protocols, such as \u201cBetter Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Networking\n\n(BATMAN)\u201d.\n\nPro-active protocols expect nodes to frequently send messages, which increases\n\npower consumption, while re-active protocols require significant start up time\n\nbefore establishing data streams.\n\nA testbed was realized to record during test runs the crucial data about\n\nneighbors, route requests, potential routers, link costs and hop counts (a typical\n\nexample of round trip times related to changing transmission topology is provided\n\nin Fig. 10.4). Thus resulting characteristics of the packet stream like packet loss\n\nrates, time needed for route reestablishment, packet inter-arrival time, network\n\ntopology and bandwidth can be evaluated. Files from the different nodes are to be\n\nsynchronized (with respect to time or to events). Typically default parameter\n\nsettings need to be adapted to the specific scenario to exhibit reasonable\n\nperformance.\n\nThe performance measurements turned out to be very sensitive to noise effects,\n\nthus a careful setup preparation is mandatory to generate comparable results.\n\nFig. 10.3 Network of mobile sensor systems with heterogeneous dynamics\n\n350 K. Schilling and M. Schmidt\n\n\n\nFor future use of MANETs in space also adaptation procedures of protocols to the\n\nspecifics of the encountered space environment are to be investigated.\n\nIndependent from the used specific protocol, Table 10.1 displays a large amount\n\nof packet losses as well as a significant maximum time for rerouting in case the\n\nnetwork topology changed during test runs. Such characteristics are to be consid-\n\nered in the design of the communication link and possibly parameter are to be\n\nrecalibrated due to the encountered specific space environment.\n\n10.3.4 Delay Tolerant Networks\n\nDelay or disruption tolerant networks (DTN) were designed for heterogeneous\n\nnodes without continuous network connectivity [9, 10]. This is typical for space\n\napplications, where link interruptions due to limited radio range or due to occulta-\n\ntion effects, as well as dynamically changing link topologies and distances are\n\ntypical for satellites in different orbits. Therefore DTNs have attracted much\n\ninterest in the space community [11, 12]. In such situations standard MANET\n\nfail, as they first attempt to establish a complete route and then transfer the data.\n\nIn case of the DTN a \u201cstore and forward\u201d concept is applied, where data are passed\n\nstep by step to available nodes in the hope to finally reach the target node.

Thus a huge amount of\n\ntraffic and of local storage needs is generated. Nevertheless also \u201chybrid\u201d approaches\n\ntrying to combine advantages from MANET with DTNs are investigated [13].\n\nStandards are provided by the bundle protocol (e.g. RFC 4838 and RFC 5050),\n\ndefining a series of contiguous data blocks as a bundle, and operating as an overlay\n\nnetwork (cf. Fig. 10.5) with a naming approach based on Endpoint Identifiers [12].\n\nIn the extreme case, even concepts for interplanetary internet have been addressed\n\nin this context [14].\n\n10.3.5 Distributed Satellite Control via Networks\n\nFor precision observations, network controls have to be established in order to\n\ncoordinate in real-time pointing of the instruments on the different satellites\n\ntowards joint observation targets. Thus, via the intersatellite links related control\n\nloops are to be closed. Challenging problems result as information in a communi-\n\ncation link is transferred in digital and packetized form in an event oriented manner,\n\nwhile control is usually based on continuous real-time information inputs, or at least\n\non inputs acquired on fixed sampling intervals. In non time-critical situations the\n\ntelemetry and telecommand data can be delayed to a specified level and then be\n\nexecuted, while in real-time context it is still a topic of intensive research.\n\nactive\nlink\n\nlogical structurephysical network\n\noverlay network\n\nSpace segment\n\ninactive\nlink\n\nFig. 10.5 Schematic of an overlay network approaches for an integrated space and ground\n\nsegment taking into account the available physical network structure and the abstracted logical\n\nstructure\n\n352 K. Schilling and M. Schmidt\n\n\n\n10.4 Conclusions and Future Trends\n\nThe paradigm shift from large spacecrafts incorporating multiple payload\n\ncapabilities to decentralized, distributed small satellite systems challenges commu-\n\nnication system technology in order to coordinate such a highly dynamic sensor\n\nnetwork. While in terrestrial data networks a huge amount of effort has been\n\ninvested, ranging from sensor networks to cloud computer networks, in the space\n\nenvironment related technologies are still in the initial stage. While basic concepts\n\ncan be transferred, specific space characteristics, like interruptions, variations in\n\ndelays due to high relative velocities of nodes require adaptations. To realize the\n\nvision of future self-organizing sensor networks in space in particular combined\n\ncommunication and control approaches need to be further developed, in particular\n\nfor time-critical situations. Breakthroughs in this field will further improve the basis\n\nfor sensor data fusion in order to achieve higher resolution and precision in\n\nobservation data.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors acknowledge the contributions from many collaborators in\n\ncomputer Science of University W\u20acurzburg and in the company Center for Telematics, where for\nyears this topic was investigated and implemented for the satellite missions UWE-1 and -2.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Especially highly distributed\n\nground station networks offer new opportunities for the operation of distributed\n\nsatellite systems. Actual networking concepts are presented and research challenges\n\nin the field of ground station networking are discussed.\n\n11.1 Introduction\n\nDistributed satellite systems can be used in wide range of application fields, for\n\nexample to increase the spatial or temporal resolution in an earth observation\n\nmission. Benefits of multi-satellite systems are discussed extensively within this\n\nbook. However, an important aspect which needs to be addressed is the operations\n\nphase of such a distributed space mission. It is obvious that the operation of several\n\nspace vehicles in a single mission requires a more sophisticated operations concept.\n\nThis involves a number of additional tasks, like planning and scheduling to coordi-\n\nnate science observations or contact windows. Depending on the number of\n\nsatellites, this can be a very time consuming and extensive task.\n\nThe current state of art procedure for multi satellite systems is to control each\n\nsatellite independently from ground, defined as constellation. Examples are mani-\n\nfold, for example the Cluster 2 mission consists of four satellites each one con-\n\ntrolled individually from ESOC mission control. In communications Iridium\n\nsatellites and in navigation GPS satellites form constellations, too. For future\n\nmissions, containing a vast number of space vehicles, this would result in an\n\nenormous effort for mission operators. There are two main approaches pursued to\n\novercome such issues: One possibility is to place more autonomy in the space\n\nM. Schmidt (*) \u2022 K.

A different\n\nstrategy is, to use a network of highly distributed ground stations to efficiently\n\noperate a distributed space segment. A new concept of low-cost ground station\n\nnetworks evolved in the last years, mirroring the distributed satellite approaches in\n\nthe ground segment, too. It is especially well suited for the operation of huge\n\nnumber of satellites. The advantage of these low-cost receiving stations is, that\n\nthey resemble in architecture and are therefore compatible with the most small\n\nsatellite platforms. Also for larger satellites promise highly distributed ground\n\nsystems a new step in satellite operations. The antenna systems of low-cost stations\n\nwere designed for specific frequency bands, the signal processing can be performed\n\nwith COTS components. This is a very interesting aspect, in this way it is possible\n\nto operate many satellites at the same time with a ground network, which was\n\noriginally not established for multi satellite operation. But due to the interoperabil-\n\nity of satellite and ground systems, the existing resources can be combined with\n\nsimple means to take advantage of the distributed nature. The main challenge is an\n\nintelligent network concept for a distributed space segment in combination with\n\nloosely coupled ground stations.\n\nIn contrast, the classic ground station approach contains typically a broad\n\nspectrum of specialized hardware, which limits the utilization to a specific kind\n\nof satellite mission or type. These dedicated ground stations can\u2019t be grouped\n\ntogether arbitrarily for the operations phase of a distributed system. Especially\n\ninteresting are concepts from the field of distributed intelligence and control for\n\ndistributed space missions, unfortunately only some of them are transferable to the\n\ntraditional ground station concept.\n\nIn this section the differences between the traditional ground station approach\n\nand low-cost ground system architectures are explained. These differ on the one\n\nside in topology, which influences the operations phase in many ways. On the other\n\nside they differ significantly in the type of components employed. Finally, the\n\ntechnological challenges for ground systems in future distributed space missions\n\nare pointed out. A very interesting aspect is the establishment of highly distributed\n\nground station networks, which can be utilized for the operation of a huge number\n\nof satellites. Section 11.2 handles in detail current ground station network projects.\n\nFurthermore, the resulting requirements for multi satellite operation are elaborated,\n\nlike coordination and scheduling. The chapter finalizes with an outline of future\n\ndevelopments in the field of highly distributed ground systems.\n\n11.1.1 Traditional Ground Station Approach\n\nSince the first space missions the ground segment consisted of several entities,\n\nexchanging information between these parts can be considered already as network-\n\ning. The aggregation of different stations was already performed in the beginning\n\nof the space era to achieve better coverage or to increase redundancy. A good\n\nexample for this \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cclassic\u201d approach is the ESA ESTRACK system,\n\n356 M. Schmidt and K. Schilling\n\n\n\nconsisting of nine ground stations combined to a network, it was initiated already in\n\nthe early 1970s. Also NASA started quite early with the combination of different\n\nstations to networks, the Deep Space Network (DSN) was established in 1958 [1].\n\nBefore addressing the traditional ground station approach, an important aspect\n\nrelated to the taxonomy of the term ground station needs to be clarified: In literature\n\nis the ground segment typically divided into mission control and ground station\n\nnetwork [2, 3]. The mission control is aggregated in control center (Mission Control\n\nCenter (MCC), Spacecraft Operations Control Center (SOCC)) and is responsible\n\nfor mission planning and mission operations, for example monitoring and com-\n\nmanding the spacecraft. The ground station network, composed of different ground\n\nstations, is on the other side dealing with signal reception and transmission, orbit\n\ntracking etc. The mission control and the ground station network are not only\n\nlogically divided, also often geographically separated from each other. A typical\n\nground station contains in this context several receiving stations including different\n\ntypes of antennas as well as corresponding hardware equipment. Exemplary, the\n\nground station in Weilheim (part of the ESTRACK system) contains six different\n\nantennas ranging from 6 to 30 m to support deep space missions as well as near\n\nEarth missions. So, a ground station describes in a traditional sense a sophisticated\n\nsystem containing a larger number of facilities for satellite communication, acting\n\nas the interface between satellite and mission control center. The traditional ground\n\nstation network contains only a few, but therefore highly specialized stations, to\n\nsupport a broad spectrum of space missions. Contrary, in the context of small\n\nsatellites projects, a ground station is considered rather as a single entity used to\n\naccess one single satellite, a ground station consists here typically only of one\n\nantenna system and corresponding equipment for communication with a single\n\nsatellite in LEO (compare Sect. 11.1.2).\n\nThe ESTRACK system is used to explain the overall organization of a large\n\nground station network. More specifically the architecture of a typical ground\n\nstation, i.e. a satellite receiving station will be explained. Issues related to\n\nground station networks itself are discussed in Sect. 11.2. The ESTRACK core\n\nground network consists currently of nine ground stations located in Australia,\n\nAfrica, Europe and South America. Since 1968, ESTRACK supported more than\n\n60 missions. The ground stations of the ESTRACK system contain many highly\n\nspecialized stations. Thus, dedicated stations for deep space missions and geosta-\n\ntionary satellites exist and can in general not be replaced with each other. The\n\nESTRACK system has for example dedicated 35 m diameter antennas for deep\n\nspace missions, for near Earth missions 15 m diameter antennas are provided. The\n\nfrequency bands range from S-Band to Ka-Band [4], thus all kind of missions can\n\nbe supported by ESTRACK, but dedicated stations for specific type of missions\n\nneed to be requested.\n\nAn exemplary ground station for communication with a LEO satellite consists\n\ntypically of the following units: Antenna system, transmitting and receiving equip-\n\nment as well as telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C) equipment: The antenna\n\nsystem contains different sized apertures, mainly large parabolic dish antennas for\n\nsignal reception (the size depends on several factors, important is to provide the\n\n11 Ground Station Networks for Distributed Satellite Systems 357\n\n\n\nnecessary gain for the link budget of a space mission). The equipment for receiving\n\nand transmitting the electromagnetic waves comprises low noise amplifiers (LNA),\n\nhigh power amplifiers (HPA), up- and down-converter. For telemetry and\n\ntelecommand are baseband devices used, its tasks are carrier acquisition, tracking\n\nand demodulation, processing of data, and ranging. Each station is composed of a\n\nbroad spectrum of devices and components and constitutes a complex facility. As\n\nmentioned above, an individual ground station is often connected to a larger\n\nnetwork of ground stations, which are then connected to several control centers\n\n(MCC and SOCC) and data networks.\n\nThe devices and components in these ground stations are usually not commercial\n\nof-the-shelf (COTS), they have to fulfill high quality requirements and satisfy\n\ncommon space related standards. Thus, specialized hardware equipment can be\n\nvery expensive. Additionally, it has to be considered, that a single ground station\n\nprovides only limited coverage for a LEO satellite. To increase the coverage for a\n\nlow altitude satellite mission, other ground stations need to be incorporated in a\n\nnetwork. However, even for a single ground station are extensive redundancy\n\nconcepts required to achieve high degree of availability for a mission. Thus,\n\nredundant equipment (receivers, transmitters, TT&C equipment, computers etc.)\n\nis essential to avoid the loss of data. In many cases it is mandatory to have a second\n\nground station available which could take over in the case of any failure. Hence, the\n\ntraditional ground station is a complex system, containing a variety of facilities,\n\ndevices and components. The effort to operate and maintain such a system is\n\nenormous; the fraction of the mission budget dedicated to operation costs should\n\nnot be underestimated. Of course, not each satellite mission needs a dedicated\n\nground station network, the established networks from the space agencies are\n\nutilized for several missions simultaneously. So, traditional ground station\n\nnetworks are open to paying customers. To run a huge ground station network a\n\nlarge part of the available budget comes from facility fees. Thus, the typical average\n\ncost of a tracking hour ranges between 300 and 450 Euros [4].\n\nOn the first glance the \u201ctraditional\u201d and the \u201clow-cost\u201d ground station approach\n\nseem fairly similar, both contain equipment for satellite tracking and reception,\n\nnevertheless significant differences exist, which are pointed out in the next section.\n\n11.1.2 Low Cost Receiving Stations\n\nThe term low-cost ground station might be a bit misleading, but it is important to\n\npoint out that the receiving stations in small satellite projects have differences in\n\ncapabilities and architecture compared to traditional ground station systems. Thus,\n\nthe term \u201clow-cost ground station\u201d is used to emphasize the difference to the\n\ntraditional approach. Low-cost means here, that these stations are not composed\n\nof high quality standard components, they are rather composed of commercial of-\n\nthe-shelf components (COTS), i.e. radio equipment, modems etc. Other authors\n\nrefer to that kind of station as radio stations or academic ground stations. Hence,\n\n358 M. Schmidt and K. Schilling\n\n\n\none has to be careful when the term ground station is used: While the classic term\n\nground station describes a complex system containing a broad spectrum of expert\n\nsystems, the same term means in the context of small satellites projects a single\n\nentity used to access one single satellite. A low-cost ground station is in contrast to\n\nthe classical definition a standalone system, comprising all components to commu-\n\nnicate with the satellite, i.e. antenna, transceiver, tracking hardware, data distribu-\n\ntion system, etc. There is no clear distinction any more between mission control and\n\nground stations. Furthermore, a ground station consists here typically only of one\n\nantenna system and corresponding equipment for communication with a single\n\nsatellite in LEO. All these stations are very similar in architecture and contain\n\nsimilar type of antennas. They utilize comparable hardware components for signal\n\nprocessing as well.\n\nThe reason why academic ground stations are so similar in architecture is that\n\nthey are designed for the communication links typically used in small satellites.\n\nDue to the limited mass and power budget and the restricted pointing capabilities\n\nare primarily UHF and VHF transceivers used for communication. The utilized\n\nfrequency bands, 70 cm and 2 m, are part of the amateur radio bands and are under\n\nthe supervision of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). Higher fre-\n\nquency bands, for example S-Band, will be the next step in the evolution process of\n\nsmall satellites, but are still rarely used.\n\nThis affects of course the architecture of low-cost ground stations: As hardware\n\ncomponents for UHF and VHF are commercially available, many ground stations\n\nare built up from low-cost commercial of-the-shelf components. Typically are\n\nstandard radio transceiver and Terminal Node Controller (TNC) components\n\nused, which are connected to simple desktop computers (example architectures\n\nare described in Refs. [5, 6]). That standard computer is normally connected to the\n\nInternet for data exchange. A variety of antennas and suitable tracking systems are\n\noffered. To control the antenna and radio equipment several software solutions are\n\navailable (open source as well as proprietary). A schematic diagram of the ground\n\nstation at the University of W\u20acurzburg is shown in Fig. 11.1.\nThe ground stations of an academic network are connected through the Internet,\n\ni.e. the Internet Protocol (IP) is used on the network layer, on the transport layer the\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used,\n\ndepending on the application on top. Each ground station in the network can be seen\n\nas an access node to a satellite, which is in contact range. Typically only one\n\ncommunication link to a satellite can be established at the same time. Currently, IP\n\nis only for the data exchange between the ground station computers used, there is no\n\nreal end-to-end communication between satellites and distant ground stations on\n\nbasis of IP realized.\n\nThe primarily used protocol for data exchange between ground station and satellite\n\nis AX.25 [7], which is conform to HDLC ISO standard 3309. AX.25 originates from\n\nthe X.25 protocol and was adapted for the special needs of the radio amateur\n\ncommunity. It is used as data link layer protocol in packet radio mode. Error\n\ndetection is possible due to a 2 byte checksum attached to each frame, corrupted\n\npackets are discarded by default from a Terminal Node Controller (TNC) device.\n\n11 Ground Station Networks for Distributed Satellite Systems 359\n\n\n\nIn many ground stations is the TNC replaced by software modem. This enables more\n\ncontrol over the radio link and delivers new opportunities for post processing of\n\ncorrupted data. AX.25 is accepted in the small satellite community as standard\n\ncommunication protocol, i.e. all major ground station network projects support\n\nAX.25. Nevertheless, a migration to CCSDS protocols might be on a long term\n\nview reasonable for compatibility reasons.\n\n11.1.3 Technological Challenges\n\nIn the last years the tremendous progress in computational power brought a number\n\nof innovations to the ground segment. This implies as well technological challenges\n\nfor ground stations and offers new approaches due to recent advances in digital\n\nsignal processing or network control. Hence, this section points out the specific\n\ntechnological challenges and implications for the ground segment to operate multi\n\nsatellite systems.\n\nIn this context the terms multi-satellite systems, distributed satellite systems and\n\nsatellite networks are used interchangeable, and describe in general a space seg-\n\nment with more than one space vehicle, which are used to achieve a common goal.\n\nThe definitions of a formation, constellation or cluster are used to distinguish\n\nbetween different topologies or satellite control strategies. Beside the space seg-\n\nment also the ground segment is integral part of each space mission. In a simple\n\nFig. 11.1 Low-cost ground station at the University of W\u20acurzburg\n\n360 M. Schmidt and K. Schilling\n\n\n\nview, one could already see one satellite and one ground station as a distributed\n\nsystem (consisting of two nodes communicating with each other during contact).\n\nBut considering a more general case, having a multi satellite system connected to a\n\nground station network, is more suitable. Therefore, one can identify two different\n\ndistributed systems, one in space and another one on ground, both in close relation-\n\nship with each other (see Fig. 11.2). This viewing angle is sometimes neglected\n\nwhen multi-satellite systems are discussed, but of course the topology of the ground\n\nsegment plays an important role for telemetry and telecommand. Due to the\n\nmovement of the satellites on their orbits, the communication links between ground\n\nstations and satellites change frequently. That adds new challenges to the operation\n\nof a satellite network, careful planning and scheduling is necessary.\n\nThis section emphasizes the challenges for low-cost ground station networks,\n\ni.e. loosely coupled radio stations with a large number of network nodes. The\n\ncorresponding infrastructure is already available; many ground stations were built\n\nin the scope of small satellite projects. First steps in the direction of networking\n\nthese stations are already underway (GENSO, GSN\u2014compare Sect. 11.2). The\n\ndescribed challenges need to be faced to enable an efficient and intelligent opera-\n\ntion of multi satellite systems.\n\nThe distinction in traditional and low-cost ground station network approach is\n\nnecessary, due to differences in topology, architecture and requirements. With\n\nrespect to satellite swarms and formations is especially the low-cost approach\n\npromising, as the large number of network nodes can be used to realize new\n\noperation concepts. Future mission scenarios including more than tens of space\n\nvehicles in a single mission need an efficient operation concept based on recent\n\nadvances from distributed system control.\n\nFig. 11.2 Distributed space systems\n\n11 Ground Station Networks for Distributed Satellite Systems 361\n\n\n\nOne of the major challenges is to coordinate and control the existing, but very\n\nheterogeneous, ground station networks. As mentioned above, current ground\n\nstation network implementations consist of loosely coupled radio stations, which\n\nare composed from a variety of COTS components. Even if the overall architecture\n\nis similar, i.e. each station contains the same functional entities like radio equip-\n\nment and modem, the individual realization of each entity might be very different:\n\nFor example, the modulation of a satellite signal is often performed from a\n\nhardware device called Terminal Node Controller (TNC), meanwhile software\n\nmodems became popular and can be used instead of a TNC. Especially with respect\n\nto the software setup are low-cost stations very heterogeneous and utilize a number\n\nof commercial, but also self developed applications. The challenge is to combine\n\nthe individual stations in such a way that the overall network can be used to\n\nefficiently operate a multi satellite system. Nevertheless, each station belongs\n\nto an independent research institute which restricts their gearing to a certain\n\ndepth. In particular on hardware level is the coordination of such a loosely coupled\n\nsystem very difficult. Hence, it has to be ensured that the stations are treated in an\n\nabstract way to fully benefit from the distributed nature.\n\nA very crucial point is the establishment of communication resp. protocol\n\nstandards for distributed space missions. Nowadays mainly conservative\n\npoint-to-point links between satellites and ground stations are employed. But the\n\nsuccess of the terrestrial internet demonstrated, how powerful a self configuring and\n\nreliable communication network can be utilized for a broad spectrum of\n\napplications. Though there is neither a satisfying solution nor an agreement on\n\ninterfaces and protocols for space communication in multi hop networks. While the\n\nIP protocol stack proved its reliability and performance in terrestrial applications, in\n\nspace missions several drawbacks were identified (especially related to the TCP\n\nprotocol). Therefore, many researchers tend to utilize dedicated protocol\n\nimplementations, like the recommendations of the CCSDS committee, defining\n\nprotocols optimized for the space environment. A major problem is then the\n\ninteroperability between the distributed system in space (relying on CCSDS) and\n\nthe distributed system on ground (mainly based on IP). So, communication\n\nstandards for the ground segment are one of the major research challenges which\n\nneed to be faced for future space mission. Which alternative will prevail in the\n\ncoming years is hard to predict, the long term objective could be the establishment\n\nof a \u201cspacenet\u201d comparable to the terrestrial internet.\n\nIn current low-cost ground station networks the availability of individual stations\n\nis relatively often affected from failures. The reason is the structure of such\n\nnetworks, composed of loosely coupled stations, which might not be available\n\ndue to trivial reasons. In terrestrial communication networks are failures handled\n\nautonomously, for example if an internet router fails, other routers automatically\n\nreconfigure routing tables to take over its responsibilities. In space applications this\n\nself-configuring capabilities are so far only rarely utilized. Thus, flexibility\n\nbecomes on the one side an important role, on the other side mechanisms to\n\ncompensate the unavailability of a single station need to be provided. As the\n\nindividual stations in low-cost ground networks are compatible with each other, it\n\n362 M. Schmidt and K. Schilling\n\n\n\nis in general possible to implement to certain degree graceful degradation. The main\n\nchallenge is here to adopt recent advances from self-configuring and autonomous\n\nnetworks to provide a high degree of flexibility and to take advantage of the\n\ndistributed nature of such networks.\n\nThe usage of low-cost ground station networks is especially promising to realize\n\nnew operation concepts. While the traditional approach uses only dedicated links to\n\nconnect one satellite to one ground station, new approaches exist which propose\n\nto use a ground network as a whole to operate a satellite. The ground network can be\n\nseen as a sensor network, which is able to determine the orbit or link quality based\n\non a multi-point measurement from ground. Such new operation concepts will enter\n\na new era of satellite operations, but placing a number of additional challenges:\n\nBeside the technological challenges like communication and failsafe capabilities,\n\nfurther issues need to be addressed: While in the traditional ground station approach\n\nthe management of the network is carried out from a single institution, the organi-\n\nzation in low-cost networks is fully distributed. There is no central entity with full\n\naccess to all nodes in the network. From terrestrial applications the benefits and\n\ndrawbacks of decentralized control mechanisms are well known, the challenge\n\nremains to transfer that knowledge to ground networks considering their\n\nparticularities. This addresses as well new requirements in cooperation between\n\nresearch institutes, from administrative and legal point of view.\n\n11.2 Ground Station Networks\n\n11.2.1 Infrastructure\n\nAlready from the very beginning of the space era, different facilities for satellite\n\noperation were grouped together as the ground segment. The ground station net-\n\nwork is here often associated with the receiving stations. Nevertheless, there is not\n\nalways a clear distinction made between the ground network and appending\n\nfacilities for mission control. These facilities are the Mission Control Centers\n\n(MCC), which are responsible for telemetry and telecommand of a spacecraft,\n\nand the Science Control Centers (SCC), which are dedicated to the science payload\n\nof a mission. These centers are not only logically separated; often they are also\n\ngeographically distributed in different locations. All facilities are typically\n\nconnected through a data network to collect, exchange and archive data and to\n\ngrant access to end users.\n\nIn the scope of many space missions a broad spectrum of ground infrastructure\n\nwas established. The available resources were steadily upgraded and emerged over\n\ntime to support different satellite missions. Therefore, those networks and appended\n\nfacilities have grown to a complex system containing a variety of network\n\narchitectures and technologies. Hence, it is hard to derive a generic architecture\n\nof a traditional ground station network. Some examples of currently utilized ground\n\nsystems are shortly introduced to give an overview: The ESTRACK system\n\n11 Ground Station Networks for Distributed Satellite Systems 363\n\n\n\noperated by ESA was already mentioned in Sect. 11.1, it has a core network of nine\n\nstations and cooperates with other organizations to increase the coverage. The main\n\ncontrol center is located in Germany (ESOC in Darmstadt). A huge network which\n\nprovides services to more than 100 satellites is the Air Force Satellite Control\n\nNetwork (AFSCN) in the US, which has 10 stations worldwide with 22 antennas.\n\nBeside the operation of military satellites they are utilized as well to provide launch\n\nand early orbit tracking. Two control centers are in charge of command of the\n\nassigned satellites. Another interesting ground station network is the deep space\n\nnetwork (DSN), which is dedicated to deep space missions and contains three\n\nfacilities for communication with deep space orbiters, separated approximately by\n\n120? in longitude (US, Spain and Australia). Each receiving location contains at\nleast four large parabolic dish antennas (ranging from 26 to 70 m).\n\nIn the context of low-cost ground stations, a dedicated mission and science\n\ncontrol center on a distant location is mostly not set up. Each individual ground\n\nstation originates from a small satellite project, the ground station itself performs all\n\nnecessary tasks for satellite operation and can be seen as a standalone system. When\n\nthese stations are combined to a network, the task of the operation centers are\n\nperformed from software applications, using the internet for data exchange.\n\nIn the following are different aspects addressed which play a major role for the\n\nground segment when distributed space missions are considered. Especially a large\n\nnumber of network nodes in a distributed mission have impact on operation\n\nconcepts.\n\n11.2.2 Highly Distributed Ground Networks\n\nThe trend to distributed space missions puts certain requirements on the ground\n\nsegment. Especially future missions, containing a large number of space assets\n\nwithin a single mission demand for a corresponding counterpart on ground. Thus,\n\nhighly distributed ground station networks are needed to cope with highly\n\ndistributed space segments. The term highly distributed ground network describes\n\nin this context a network of ground stations with a large number of network nodes,\n\nwhere more than one station can communicate with a distributed space mission at\n\nthe same time. Hence, several communication links can be established between\n\nspace and ground in parallel.\n\nTo emphasize the needs of highly distributed ground networks, the QB50mission\n\nis introduced. The QB50 project is a very promising mission relying on a multi\n\nsatellite system [8], initiated from the Von Karman Institute (VKI) and supported\n\nfrom many European experts. The scientific objective of QB50 is the in situ\n\nmeasurement of spatial and temporal variations of key parameters in the lower\n\nthermosphere. The measurements are performed from 50 double CubeSats,\n\nlaunched together and separated consecutively from the launch vehicle. All satellites\n\nare equipped with identical sensors, which obtain data approximately 100 km\n\nseparated from each other. Furthermore, the re-entry process of the distributed\n\nsatellite system is studied. Interesting is the fact that the 50 satellites are provided\n\n364 M. Schmidt and K. Schilling\n\n\n\nfrom 50 different institutes, so the satellite swarm itself is very heterogeneous. For\n\noperation is the ground station network GENSO foreseen (detailed description of\n\nGENSO follows below). The project is a promising mission with scientific value;\n\nnevertheless suitable strategies for efficient operation of such a satellite network are\n\nnot available yet. One key aspect for the proper operation of 50 satellites flying near\n\nto each other in nearly the same orbit is the availability of appropriate ground\n\nresources, as well as scheduling and data management (compare Sect. 11.2.3).\n\nThe QB50 mission concept is used to illustrate the specific requirements placed\n\non the ground segment in such a distributed mission including a large number of\n\nvehicles. Beside the large number of satellites, the short contact times in a LEO\n\norbit (5\u20136 contacts between 5 and 15 min a day) complicate the operation. Another\n\nissue is the restricted lifetime of the distributed space mission, due to the low\n\naltitude of the satellite orbits. Of course the low altitude orbit is intended, larger\n\nsatellites are normally not placed in such low orbits because of the remaining\n\natmosphere which restricts the lifetime dramatically. Hence, the restricted lifetime\n\nof the mission prevents the possibility to use a single ground station to communi-\n\ncate sequentially with each satellite in the network in a large time horizon. Thus, the\n\nquestion needs to be faced how to gather the data from the space vehicles efficiently\n\ndown to earth. The most convenient way is to collect the data from all the\n\n50 satellites by the utilization of a highly distributed ground network. QB50 intends\n\nto use the GENSO network for this reason, which is due to the large number of\n\nparticipating stations an ideal platform to operate many satellites in parallel.\n\nIn the following are two implementations of highly distributed ground station\n\nnetworks described, mainly composed from low-cost receiving stations. They\n\nprovide the capability to track a distributed space missions with a large number\n\nof receiving stations and are therefore well suited for operation of satellite swarms\n\nor formations.\n\n11.2.2.1 Global Education Network for Satellite Operations (GENSO)\n\nThe Global Education Network for Satellite Operations (GENSO) was started\n\nin 2006 from the International Space Education Board (ISEB), which consists\n\nof the educational departments of CSA, JAXA, NASA and ESA. Objectives of\n\nthe GENSO project are to allow remote access for operators to their satellites over\n\nthe network, provide remote control of the participating ground stations and to define\n\nand implement a global standard for educational ground stations. The GENSO\n\nsoftware provides a distributed platform based on a client and server architecture.\n\nA server application, the so called Ground Station Server (GSS), is installed on each\n\nground station participating in the network. Mission Control Clients (MCC) are used\n\nfrom the satellite operators to bring the data from the satellite back to the owner.\n\nSecure access is granted from Authentication Servers [9]. From a technical point of\n\nview is the GSS software responsible for handling the interfaces to the hardware\n\ndevices, i.e. rotor and radio equipment. Software libraries like the Ham Radio\n\nControl Libraries were integrated to support a broad spectrum of COTS components.\n\n11 Ground Station Networks for Distributed Satellite Systems 365\n\n\n\nThe MCC software is used from an operator to control the configuration of a\n\nconnected GSS server. It contains a graphical user interface, but also provides\n\ninterfaces for customized software solutions for satellite operation. The public\n\nresponse to GENSO is very remarkable and many small satellite developers\n\nannounced their interest to join the GENSO network. More than 30 universities\n\nand radio amateurs are currently involved in the early operational phase [10]. The\n\nproject issued already a first version of its software, but is still under testing phase.\n\n11.2.2.2 Ground Station Network (GSN) of the UNISEC Group in Japan\n\nThe ground station Network project of the UNISEC group was already initiated in\n\n1998. As JAXA also takes part in the ISEB, there is close cooperation between\n\ndevelopers from the GSN and the GENSO projects. The GSN network was\n\nestablished on a national level in Japan. Objective of GSN is to construct a\n\nnetwork-based ground station system with functionalities for remote control via\n\nInternet. More than ten ground stations in Japan are participating in the project [11].\n\nConducted experiments demonstrated already successful how the operation of pico-\n\nsatellites can be improved by the usage of several ground stations. The GSN system\n\nbases on the Ground Station Management Server (GMS), a package of software\n\nfunctions which are necessary to remotely control ground station hardware. As each\n\nground station has different hardware architecture, specific device drivers need to\n\nbe implemented to interface the GMS client software. The data exchange between\n\nclient and local ground station hardware uses the Web Services technology, a W3C\n\nterm for communication between devices using web standards, in this way is a\n\nplatform independent remote control concept realized. An operator using GMS can\n\ndirectly control hardware devices like TNC or radio equipment.\n\n11.2.3 Planning and Scheduling\n\nOne of the most limited resources of a satellite in a low Earth orbit is for sure the\n\ncommunication time. The contact window between a satellite and ground station can\n\nbe determined from the orbit elements and the location of the ground station. For a\n\nLEO satellite are typically 5\u20136 contact windows between 5 and 15 min available\n\neach day. This implies two major drawbacks: First, the satellite is only visible for a\n\nfew minutes each day, which limits the amount of transferable data dramatically.\n\nMoreover, the ground station is not utilized for a large fraction of each day. Second,\n\nthe contact windows have fixed start and end times due to orbit geometry and a\n\nground station can serve only a single satellite at a time. Therefore, overlapping\n\ncontact windows of individual satellites lead to the question which of these satellites\n\nshould be operated first. To handle conflicts respectively overlapping contact\n\nwindows, scheduling comes into play. The term scheduling describes in general\n\nthe assignment of scarce resources to activities, with the objective to optimize one or\n\n366 M. Schmidt and K. Schilling\n\n\n\nmore performance measures [12]. Planning is a very general term and involves\n\nformulating a sequence of actions to achieve a desired objective, for example path or\n\ntask planning. According to [13], scheduling is a special case of planning, where the\n\nactions are already chosen, leaving only the problem of determining a feasible order.\n\nIn certain environments is the process of planning and scheduling still performed\n\nmanually and is therefore very time consuming. It takes for example already 5 h to\n\ncreate a preliminary schedule for a small number of tracking stations of the Air Force\n\n[14]. In larger networks, the creation and optimization of suitable schedules can take\n\nweeks. A variety of systems for automatic scheduling in space applications were\n\nalready investigated in the past, this section focuses on the satellite range scheduling\n\ndomain.\n\nThe term scheduling is used for a wide field of problems, in space context the\n\nSatellite Range Scheduling (SRS) problem was investigated in deep. It is defined\n\nas the generic problem of scheduling task requests for communication antennas,\n\nintroduced from Schalck [15]. A satellite can only communicate with a ground\n\nstation when it is within the transmitting horizon of the ground station, depending\n\non the orbit geometry this occurs periodically. Creating an efficient schedule is\n\nvery sophisticated due to the huge number of combinatorial possibilities of\n\nsatellites and ground stations. The SRS domain can be further divided into the\n\nSingle Resource Range Scheduling Problem (SiRRSP) and Multi Resource\n\nRange Scheduling Problem (MuRRSP), where SiRRSP describes the case of a\n\nsingle ground station (respectively antenna) allocation to several satellites. The\n\ngeneral problem of assigning a ground network to several satellites is contained\n\nin the MuRRSP domain. It was shown from Burrowbridge, that the SiRRSP\n\n(i.e. only one ground station) can be solved in polynomial time when only LEO\n\nsatellites are considered [16]. In contrary, in the MuRRSP domain (i.e. more\n\nthan one ground station needs to be assigned), the contained problems are NP\n\ncomplete [17].\n\nSRS scheduling was investigated in deep for a number of different applications,\n\neach having special constraints or requirements, e.g. related to scheduling time\n\nhorizon and type of satellite missions. Comparing the results from these different\n\napplications shows, that the performance of an algorithm depends strongly on the\n\nproblem formulation and structure. While for example a genetic algorithm proved\n\nto obtain good results for the satellite range scheduling problem in the AFSCN\n\nnetwork, genetic algorithms failed to get comparable results in similar scheduling\n\nproblems. So, heuristics and strategies can\u2019t be transferred easily from one applica-\n\ntion to a slightly modified version of the same problem. There is no state of the art\n\nalgorithm which delivers good average result on all scheduling problems in space\n\ncontext.\n\nIn classic satellite range scheduling (SRS) is the objective to increase the\n\nutilization of the ground network, this holds not necessarily for low-cost ground\n\nstation networks, here the objective is rather to extend the contact time with the\n\nsatellites by sharing resources. The participants of these ground station networks\n\nare faced with the following problem: Very often the ground stations were built up\n\nin the scope of small satellite projects, but as these satellites are normally launched\n\n11 Ground Station Networks for Distributed Satellite Systems 367\n\n\n\nto low Earth orbit (LEO), the available communication time is restricted to a few\n\nminutes a day. By sharing the ground stations between two institutions, the contact\n\ntime with the satellites can be doubled on both sides. That is an important difference\n\nto traditional ground station networks, which are sharing the ground stations with\n\ncommercial interest, increasing the utilization is therefore necessary for economic\n\nreasons. Major emphasis in low-cost ground station networks is placed on flexibil-\n\nity, i.e. a flexible scheduling process is desired. Traditional ground station networks\n\non the other side have to create schedules for long time horizons.\n\nFirst approaches tailored for the special particularities of low-cost ground station\n\nnetworks were proposed recently: These consider also the case that several ground\n\nstations are used to track a single satellite. An approach for scheduling the requests\n\nin the GENSO network was presented from Preindl et al. [18], it is based on the\n\nbooking request structure used in the GENSO network. A similar approach dedi-\n\ncated to flexible scheduling in highly distributed ground station networks is\n\ndiscussed in Ref. [19]. Main focus lays on the ability to create schedules for short\n\ntime horizons to cope with the requirements of flexibility in low-cost ground station\n\nnetworks.\n\n11.2.4 Coordination and Administration of Ground\nStation Networks\n\nAny ground station network consists of a huge variety of components, devices and\n\nfacilities, which are networked together to a complex topology. Both types of\n\nground station networks, traditional and low-cost approach, have to place a consid-\n\nerable amount of effort to control and administrate the overall network (control is in\n\nthis context related to the operations of the ground station network itself, not a\n\nsatellite which is controlled resp. operated from the ground station network).\n\nBasically there are two choices how the administration can be organized: A\n\ncentralized administration from a single organization or a distributed solution\n\nwhere several entities coordinate and manage the system in a distributed or\n\ndecentralized manner.\n\nThe centralized approach as well as the decentralized approach has benefits and\n\ndrawbacks. While central services or functions are easier to implement, they might\n\nbe affected by single point of failures (which has to be compensated with proper\n\nredundancy). On the other side are decentralized control strategies under certain\n\nconditions very sophisticated to implement, as appropriate ways of coordination\n\nand synchronization need to be provided. For example arises in a decentralized\n\norganization the question who has the permission to take decisions, assign\n\nresources or change the behavior of the network. Especially when the participants\n\nshare their resources on a voluntary basis, a centralized coordination can be difficult\n\nto realize. The advantage of decentralized control is the possibility of graceful\n\ndegradation and failsafe capability in the case of failures.\n\n368 M. Schmidt and K. Schilling\n\n\n\nTraditional ground station networks are mainly centrally organized, i.e. there is\n\ntypically one controlling organization on top, for example ESOC in the case of the\n\nESA ESTRACK system, which is able to manage or control the complete network.\n\nFor example is maintenance or migration to new software or hardware managed\n\ncentrally by ESOC [4]. But also the ESTRACK system has interfaces to other\n\nground station networks, which support the ESTRACK core network with stations\n\nfrom other organizations. This implies corresponding interfaces for remote opera-\n\ntion and introduces a certain degree of decentralization.\n\nLow-cost ground networks are mainly decentralized organized. The individual\n\nstations are loosely coupled through the internet; there is no full access to the\n\nground station hardware itself. Remote operation is possible through various\n\nsoftware interfaces provided from projects like GENSO or GSN (see above).\n\nNevertheless, there is no central entity which takes care about collective hardware\n\nupdates or maintenance actions. Each station is to a large fraction self-reliant, the\n\nassociated institution decides whether a station is running or idle. This requires a\n\nmore abstract view on a ground station, as a stations should be \u201creplaced\u201d when it\n\ndrops out with another station (this is in general possible due to the similar\n\narchitecture of low-cost stations). This is a bit comparable with the routing process\n\nin the internet, where a router could at any time neglect its service, which can be\n\ncompensated easily from the neighboring nodes by updating the routing tables.\n\nSimilar concepts are foreseen for highly distributed ground networks, where any\n\nground station can take over the signal reception when a communication window\n\nexists for the desired satellite. An approach in that direction was proposed from\n\nCutler [20], who uses a virtualization concept for ground stations to simulate a\n\nsimilar network structure like observed in computer networks.\n\n11.3 Future Developments\n\nWhile the traditional satellite operation scheme assigns one ground station for\n\noperation to one satellite, new concepts using a network of ground stations to\n\ntrack a single satellite were brought up recently. Hence, the conventional one-to-\n\none link from satellite to receiving station is replaced by a one-to-many link (one-\n\nto-many links are of course only possible for reception of satellite signals, for\n\ntelecommand still one-to-one links need to be employed). Nevertheless, these\n\nredundant links are not only useful for backup purposes, they can be used as well\n\nto realize distributed measurements or link quality improvements. Two exemplary\n\nfuture applications taking advantage of that principle are shortly described in the\n\nfollowing:\n\nA proposed idea is to determine orbit elements with Doppler shift measurements\n\nfrom ground. The ground station network can be seen in this scenario as a sensor\n\nnetwork. The determination of orbit elements from simultaneous measurements is\n\nstate of the art; the challenging aspect is to use a highly distributed ground network\n\nto determine the orbit of several space vehicles flying in close orbits or formation.\n\n11 Ground Station Networks for Distributed Satellite Systems 369\n\n\n\nEspecially during the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) can an orbit determi-\n\nnation system based on the measurements in a ground station network like GENSO\n\nsupport operators. This would complement the orbit data issued from other organi-\n\nzation like NORAD to achieve more accurate tracking.\n\nA second application scenario is the usage of simultaneous downlinks in a\n\nground network to detect transmission errors. This principle was initially proposed\n\nfrom Stolarski [21], the parallel received bit streams from a transmitter are com-\n\npared with each other. When transmission errors are detected a majority voting is\n\nused to determine the correct bit. The algorithm was demonstrated with a transmit-\n\nter on a weather balloon and three receiving stations on earth, it was proven that this\n\nmechanism can be used to decrease the bit error rate. A step further is proposed in\n\nRef. [22], the described system synchronizes automatically data frames in low-cost\n\nground station networks. Frames which were received simultaneously from several\n\nstations can after the synchronization process used to detect and correct transmis-\n\nsion errors. In small satellite missions the primarily used communication protocol is\n\nAX.25, it does not support forward error correction, but it contains a frame\n\nchecking sequence which can be used to check if the data correction was successful.\n\nIt can be expected that future distributed systems in the space and in the ground\n\nsegment will complement each other in an integrated distributed efficient infra-\n\nstructure. This way fault tolerant, robust systems with high efficiency are expected,\n\ntaking advantage from the terrestrial trends and advancements towards distributed\n\nnetworked computing.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Missions and studies to\n\nperform Earth observations by optical remote sensing are also reported.\n\n12.1 Introduction\n\nDistributed Space Systems (DSS) involve two or more space vehicles and a\n\ncooperative infrastructure to improve resolution and coverage achievable from\n\nscientific remote sensing platform [1]. One of the main technology challenges of\n\nDSS is the precise control of the relative positions of satellites, which separation\n\ndistance affects the sensing performance. To this end, starting from 1965 a number\n\nof formation flying experiments have been conducted. The first one was performed\n\nwhen Gemini 6A stayed close to Gemini 7 for about 5 h [2]. The experiment\n\nforesaw that only one spacecraft was actively controlled while the other one stayed\n\npassive. In 1997, there was the first \u201cautonomous\u201d formation flying mission, the\n\nJapanese ETS-7. It was made up by two satellites, named Chaser and Target,\n\ndeveloped to acquire the basic technologies of rendezvous docking and space\n\nrobotics. Specifically, Target was placed 200 mm away from Chaser and the robotic\n\narm was used to hold it in place and three rendezvous and docking operations was\n\nsuccessful completed [3]. Since then, a lot of formation flying missions or demon-\n\nstration initiatives have been developed.\n\nThere is no unique way to classify them but a quite large accepted rule foresees\n\nthe difference between trailing and cluster formations. In cluster formation, the\n\nsatellites don\u2019t follow the same path but their orbits are chosen to the end to keep\n\nM.D. Graziano (*)\nDepartment of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, Second University of Naples, Via Roma\n\n29, 81031 Aversa (CE), Italy\n\ne-mail: mariadaniela.graziano@unina2.it\n\nM.

The first complete study\n\nabout cluster formation is Techsat-21 mission (see Sect. 12.3), started in 1997 when\n\nAir Force Research Laboratory presented the innovative mission concept based on\n\nreconfigurable formation of microsatellites. Typically, a cluster is composed of\n\nidentical satellites, as happens for Techsat-21, CanX-4\u20135, 3CSat or TICS (see Sect.\n\n12.5 and 12.7), but it has been also studied the possibility to have different payloads\n\non the flight platforms, as foreseen for F6 or FASTRAC (see Sect. 12.5 and 12.7).\n\nIn trailing formation, the satellites have one or more payloads in common but the\n\nspacecrafts are designed to reach different goals. The satellites follow the same path\n\nto the end to improve the resolution and coverage performance. As an example, even\n\nif Terra aims to study Earth system and climate and Aqua is designed to measure\n\nwater in all its forms, they have two common payloads, which data can be synergi-\n\ncally used to improve resolution and coverage. Moreover, LandSat-7 crosses the\n\nequator 1 min before EO-1 (see Sect. 12.4), creating a historical image archive of\n\nEarth surface.\n\nIt is worthy of mention, the ESA Swarm [4] mission, composed of three identical\n\nspacecraft in near polar orbit with altitude ranging from 400 to 550 km. The mission\n\ncannot be defined a cluster or a trailing formation, because two spacecraft fly side-\n\nby-side at lower altitude measuring the East\u2013west gradient of the magnetic field\n\nwhile the third one fly at higher altitude. The mission, which launch is planned for\n\nbefore mid-2012, will map the magnetic field of the Earth with unprecedented\n\nspatial and temporal accuracy.\n\nIn the following sections, more details are given for relevant missions and\n\nmission studies related to distributed systems and Earth observations. The follow-\n\ning chapters will then complete the figure of the past and current activities.\n\n12.2 TOPSAT\n\nThe Global Topography Mission, whose name was successively changed into\n\nTOPSAT [5, 6], was proposed as a result of Topographic Science Working Group\n\n[7] results about the usefulness of high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)\n\nfor many scientific applications. SAR interferometry was identified as the key\n\ntechnique to attain DEMs on a global scale, whereas a multibeam laser altimeter\n\nwould have been used to derive very accurate measurements over limited spots on\n\nthe Earth surface. The mission was planned as a joint USA/Italy effort, with Italy\n\nproviding the satellites and USA the payloads.\n\nThe main objective of the interferometric SAR on board TOPSAT would have\n\nconsisted in global elevation measurements with horizontal resolution of 30 m,\n\nhorizontal accuracy of 10 m, and vertical accuracy of 1\u20133 m over 90% of Earth land\n\nand ice sheets, in less than 6 months. In addition, high vertical accuracy\n\n(20 cm\u20131 m) data would have been collected over selected areas of Earth lands\n\nand ice sheets by laser altimetry.\n\n376 M.D. Graziano\n\n\n\nDifferent solutions were considered to implement the SAR interferometer:\n\n\u2022 Ka band system relying on a rigid truss\n\n\u2022 L-band system achieving a vertical baseline thanks to a tether\n\n\u2022 L-band system with horizontal baseline achieved with two free-flying satellites\n\nThe first option was abandoned due the difficulties in both the deployment of the\n\ninterferometer and the control of its vibrations. The tethered option was afterwards\n\ndiscarded as a consequence of the partial failure of the TSS-1 mission. Therefore,\n\nthe formation option was selected with the relative orbit reeling on ascending node\n\nand anomaly separations, which would nowadays called a pendulum configuration\n\nwith no difference in orbital inclination. Baseline reconstruction accuracy was\n\nconsidered one of the most severe technical challenges. It was in fact estimated\n\nthat 3 cm (with early 1990s technology) could have been achieved by post\n\nprocessing of GPS measurements.\n\nThe mission was cancelled due to budget restrictions and NASA replaced it with\n\nthe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission on board the Space Shuttle.\n\n12.3 Techsat-21\n\nTechsat-21 [8, 9] is a flight experiment developed by Air Force Research Labora-\n\ntory (AFRL) to assess the utility of the space\u2013based sparse-array aperture formed\n\nby the satellite cluster.\n\nThe formation is made up by three identical microsatellites in LEO near circular\n\norbit, flying in various configurations with relative distance ranges from 100 m to\n\n5 km, equipped with an X-band 2-D electronically steered antenna.\n\nThe choice of microsatellites formation instead of one large satellite increase the\n\nlaunch flexibility, the system reliability and allows unlimited aperture size and\n\ngeometry.\n\nThe primary radar mode is the Moving Target Indicator (MTI), working so that\n\neach satellite transmits a different signal and it is able to receive also the signals for\n\nthe other two satellites [10]. To detect a moving target, which appears as a spark in\n\nthe angle-Doppler domain, a narrow antenna main beam is required, implying a too\n\nlarge number of samples with a consequently unacceptable increase of processing\n\ntime. To overcome this limitation, a spatial undersampling has been considered and\n\nan analysis of the clutter associated with the lost side lobe control has been\n\ndeveloped, showing that a better target detectability has been possible using\n\nperiodically thinned array. Therefore, the basic configuration for Techsat-21\n\nconsists of planar 19-element array, vertically displaced to provide the highest\n\ngain at the maximum range. The array geometry aims at creation of triangular\n\ngrid, composed of one satellite in the center and six satellite distributed on the first\n\nellipse and other 12 satellites on the largest ellipse. Each satellites makes one cycle\n\nalong its ellipse during one Earth orbit, so that the triangular grid is maintained.\n\nThe rotation of the array leads to a continuous change of the grating lobe structure.\n\n12 Overview of Distributed Missions 377\n\n\n\nThe problem has been solved selecting a pulse repetition frequency (PRF)\n\naccording to grating lobe structure to the end of maximizing the signal to clutter\n\nfactor.\n\nThe processing, communications, control functions as well as payload functions\n\nare distributed among the three satellites, which are able to operate as a single\n\n\u201cvirtual\u201d satellite. In order to have three microsatellites working as one \u201cvirtual\u201d\n\nsatellite, the formation configuration and evolution must be controlled. Specifically,\n\nthe nominal separation between the satellites has to be maintained within 10% of\n\ntheir values. Numerical results have been shown meter level tracking error in the\n\nformation by using variable, continuous low level trusts. In addition, the spacecraft\n\nrelative positions accuracy is achieved at millimeter level through the use of carrier\n\nphase differential GPS and the active control of the attitude is required to avoid\n\nerrors in the control force directions. In such close formation, each satellite is able\n\nto execute also a fail-safe separation algorithms when the relative distance is below\n\na defined threshold.\n\nThe launch was foreseen in 2004 but the program was at first restructured\n\nbecause it reveals \u201cfar more challenging than originally thought\u201d [11] and then it\n\nwas cancelled in 2003 due to continuous cost overruns.\n\n12.4 A-Train and Morning Constellation\n\nIn the last two decades, two large satellite formations were put in orbit, \u201cMorning\n\nconstellation\u201d and \u201cAfternoon Train\u201d, mainly dedicated to atmospheric and clouds\n\nproperties studies.\n\nFigure 12.1 shows the time distance between the satellites, whereas Table 12.1\n\ncontains the launch date and equator crossing time.\n\n\u201cMorning Constellation\u201d is made up by Landsat-7, EO-1, SAC-C and Terra,\n\nwhich have been working since March 2001 as a single mission, with satellites\n\ncrossing the equator from 10 am to 10:30 am. The constellation provides: (1) quasi-\n\nsimultaneous acquisition of images from the four satellite, (2) carrying out autono-\n\nmous navigation experiment, (3) testing GPS satellite constellation for atmospheric\n\nstudies, navigation and attitude and orbit control, (4) demonstrate various formation\n\nflying technologies. On October 2000, CONAE presented the Announcement of\n\nOpportunity to investigate possible applications of constellation in the fields of\n\nhydrology, desertification, urban planning, precision farming, forestry, ecology\n\natmospheric and ionospheric studies and clouds properties, with more than 200\n\nprojects approved.\n\nThe first satellite of the formation is Landsat-7 [12], which is part of NASA\n\nLandsat program, started in 1975 to collect spectral information from Earth\u2019s\n\nsurface, creating historical archive. It is equipped with a multispectral sensor\n\nknown as the Enhanced ThematicMapper Plus (ETM+), which has a high-resolution\n\npanchromatic wide band. Landsat-7 orbit is slightly to the west of Earth Observing\n\nOne (EO-1) satellite and it crosses the equator 1 min before EO-1 satellite.\n\n378 M.D. Graziano\n\n\n\nEO-1 [13] is equipped with three observing instrument: an Advanced Land\n\nImager (ALI), the first high spatial resolution spectrometer (Hyperion) to look at\n\nthe Earth and an high spectral resolution wedge imaging spectrometer (LAC) to\n\nestimate the content of water vapor in the atmosphere. Given the very short distance\n\nbetween EO-1 and Landsat-7, the 7.7 km-swath of Hyperion and 37 km-swath of\n\nALI overlap the 185 km-swath of ETM + on the equator, allowing a multiple\n\nmeasurement on the same area with several instrument at the same time. EO-1\n\nand Landsat-7 are not only in formation between them, but they work as a single\n\nmission with SAC-C and Terra.\n\nSAC-C [14] is the Argentine Earth observing satellite, equipped with ten\n\ndifferent instruments for evaluation of desertification processes and their evolution\n\nin time to identify and predict agriculture production, to monitor flood areas and to\n\nmake studies in coastal and fluvial areas.\n\nTable 12.1 Trailing\n\nformation satellites: launch\n\ndate and equator crossing\n\ntime\n\nSatellite name Launch date Equator crossing time\n\nLandsat-7 April 15, 1999 10:01\n\nTerra December 18, 1999 10:31\n\nEO-1 November 20, 2000 10:02\n\nSAC-C November 20, 2000 10:29\n\nAqua May 4, 2002 1:30\n\nAura July 15, 2004 1:38\n\nParasol December 18, 2004 1:33\n\nCloudSat April 28, 2006 1:31\n\nCALIPSO April 28, 2006 1:31:15\n\nOCO Planned for 2013 1:15\n\nFig. 12.1 Equator crossing\n\ntime difference for\n\n\u201cMorning\u201d and \u201cAfternoon\u201d\n\nsatellite formations\n\n12 Overview of Distributed Missions 379\n\n\n\nTerra [15] is the first NASA EOS satellite, called also EOS AM-1, to observe\n\nand measure the state of the Earth system and to monitor global environmental\n\nchanges over time. The satellite is able to provide information about the physical\n\nand radiative properties of clouds, measurement of trace gases and vulcanology,\n\nimproving the ability to detect human impacts on the Earth system and climate.\n\nTerra moves south across the equator at 10:30\u201310:45 am and north across the\n\nequator at 10:30\u201310:45 pm, followed by Aqua satellite, crossing the equator at\n\n1:30 pm northward and 1:30 am southward. Because of the respective late morning\n\nand early afternoon data collection times, Terra and Aqua were formerly named\n\nEOS AM and EOS PM, respectively. With Terra and Aqua both flying, the two\n\ninstruments common to both spacecraft, MODIS and CERES, double the amount of\n\npotential daily data obtainable from either satellite alone. MODIS is a Moderate-\n\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer operating from visible to thermal infrared to\n\nprovide measurements of cloud and aerosol properties and their effects on the solar\n\nradiation budget and global climate whereas CERES, standing for Clouds and the\n\nEarth\u2019s Radiant Energy System, aims to study Earth\u2019s radiation budget and atmo-\n\nspheric radiation from the top of the atmosphere to the surface, operating in the\n\nultraviolet through thermal infrared in three wide bands. Thus, the synergic utiliza-\n\ntion of this two instrument has a significant value in providing information on the\n\ndiurnal cycle of some of the rapidly changing variables, such as clouds and\n\naerosols, and in providing improved daily and longer term statistics on those\n\nvariables.\n\nAqua [16] was launched by NASA in 2002. It has the earliest equator crossing\n\ntime focuses on studies of water in the Earth/atmosphere system. Aqua carries a\n\nsynergistic instrument payload that measures water in its gaseous, liquid and solid\n\nforms, plus atmospheric and surface temperature, land and ocean vegetation.\n\nAqua satellite flies in formation with other five satellites [16], AURA, PARA-\n\nSOL, CloudSat, CALIPSO and OCO, composing the so called Afternoon Train\n\n(A-train), because the equator crossing time is around the 1 pm.\n\nAURA and PARASOL were launched in 2004. AURA [16] aims at study air\n\nquality, stratospheric ozone and climate change. Specifically, the satellite is able to\n\nobserve global distributions of temperature by HIgh Resolution Dynamics Limb\n\nSounder (HIRDLS) scanning the horizon as opposed to looking down on the surface.\n\nIn addition, a Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) can measure the concentrations of\n\nozone-destroying chemicals throughout the stratosphere and upper troposphere as\n\nwell as water vapor greenhouse gas in the upper atmosphere.\n\nPARASOL [16] is a French mission able to make measurements of the total and\n\npolarized light in several wavelengths and at several different viewing angles.\n\nThese data can be combined to study the state of the light reflected by the coupled\n\nsurface-atmosphere system, characterize clouds and aerosols in the atmosphere, the\n\ninfluence of the human activity on the aerosols percentage in the atmosphere and its\n\ninfluence on the climate change. It is equipped with a POLarization and\n\nDirectionally of the Earth\u2019s Reflectance (POLDER) able to sample three distinct\n\npolarizations.\n\nOther two components of A-Train were launched in 2006, CloudSat and\n\nCALIPSO [17, 18].\n\n380 M.D. Graziano\n\n\n\nCloudSat is a U.S./Canadian missions to study clouds and how they affect the\n\nEarth climate. It carries a powerful Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) with 500-m\n\nvertical resolution in microwave region where the signal is not significatively\n\nattenuated by clouds, the radar is able to detect 90% of all ice cloud and 80% of\n\nwater clouds. CloudSat was the first satellite to use a 94 GHz radar for atmospheric\n\nobservation.\n\nCALIPSO is a U.S./French collaboration to improve our understanding of the\n\nrole of aerosols and clouds in the Earth\u2019s climate system. CALIPSO\u2019s main\n\ninstrument is called Cloud Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)\n\ndesigned to measure the vertical profile of aerosols and clouds with 30-cm vertical\n\nresolution and 333-m horizontal resolution.\n\nThe last satellite included in A-Train is called OCO.\n\nOCO-1 [19] satellite was lost during launch in 2009 and it will be replaced by\n\nOCO-2, planned for 2013. This satellite will make global, space-based observations\n\nof carbon dioxide CO2, being equipped with three grating spectrometer to provide\n\nindependent approaches to validate the data and ensure high accuracy.\n\nAlso Glory [20] satellite should have been included in A-Train formation, but\n\nthe launch failed in 2011. It should have provided a greater understanding of the\n\nseasonal variability of the aerosol properties and understanding whether the tem-\n\nperature increase and the influence of the man-made source on the climate change.\n\nThe A-Train satellites are in close proximity to gain a better understanding of\n\nimportant parameters related to climate change and the formation wants to provide\n\nsynergic measurements on the same areas. The difference in the resolution and the\n\nsize of the footprint make difficult the synergic use of the data and the formation\n\nwill need to be precisely aligned.\n\n12.5 F6\n\nF6 (Future, Fast, Flexible, Fractionated, Free-Flying) Program\u2019s main goal is an on-\n\norbit demonstration of \u201cfractionated\u201d spacecraft [21\u201325]. The initiative, developed\n\nby the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), aims to develop the\n\nnecessary technology to build a single large satellite with free-flying satellites,\n\nwirelessly connected, showing the feasibility and the benefits of a system in which\n\nthe module for power generation and storage, communication and payload are\n\nallocated on different flight platforms. Several benefits have been identified as\n\ndriver factors for the program: (1) Flexibility, thanks to the possibility to add\n\nmodules for specific purpose, (2) Reduced Risk, since the modules will be put in\n\norbit with multiple launches, (3) Production Learning, based on module industrial\n\nproduction on large scale, (4) Adaptability, which implies the ability of the system\n\nto change configuration on demand, (5) Survivability, because the mission can\n\ncontinue even if one or more modules fail, (6) Payload Isolation, due to the\n\ndistribution of functionalities on several platforms.\n\n12 Overview of Distributed Missions 381\n\n\n\nAs starting points, program constraints have established that each spacecraft\n\nmodule shall be less than 300 kg wet mass and have a lifetime of 1 year after the\n\nlaunch of the last module, the first launch shall be within 4 years of the program\n\nstart and the launch vehicle, manufactured in US, shall have performed at least one\n\nsuccessful launch.\n\nDARPA have identified several technological challenges: networking, to dem-\n\nonstrate that the spacecraft are able to change autonomously the network configu-\n\nration, considering the ground element as a network node, wireless communications\n\nbetween each node, cluster flight, to demonstrate not only that the modules can\n\ndisplaced within a specific radius but also in a defensive cluster geometry,\n\ndistributed computing to prove the flexibility and adaptability and wireless power\n\ntransfer.\n\nThe enable technology are currently under development, solicited by multiple\n\nBroad Agency Announcement (BAA) and prize award. The program should culmi-\n\nnate with an on-orbit demonstration 2013, to test the maintenance of the clusters,\n\nremoval of a spacecraft from the cluster, the real-time resources sharing, the\n\nautonomous reconfiguration of the formation and the emergency maneuvers to\n\ndebris avoidance.\n\nWhereas F6 spacecraft is fractionated by function, DARPA explored also the\n\npotentialities of a system composed by identical satellites working together to\n\nachieve a common task. The program, called TICS (Tiny, Independent,\n\nCoordinating Spacecraft), foresaw swarms of small satellites (1\u20134 kg), launched\n\nby a common aircraft, to enable sensing and servicing missions. As an example, one\n\nof the TICS program application foresaw a protection formation to defense large\n\nsatellites from direct attack. The program was cancelled in 2009.\n\n12.6 Distributed Optical Payloads\n\nThe concept of distributed system has been applied also to optical missions.\n\nThe general goal of filled large aperture is simple in principle [26]: bringing\n\nantenna apertures form the order of magnitude of few to tens square meters to\n\nhundreds square meters or square kilometers and optical apertures from few square\n\nmeters to hundreds of kilometers. The concept of such systems does not differ from\n\nstandard system since there is a primary mirror (microwave or optical) and a feed\n\n(microwave) of a focal plane (optical).\n\nThe concept of large filled apertures was as an example exploited at JPL [26].\n\nThe innovative concept is that the system, named GEOTEL, is made up by six\n\nseparated free flying optical modules, to allow for high resolution Earth observation.\n\nThe primary mirror, also called Primary Electrostatic Membrane Reflector (25-m\n\ndiameter), is a gossamer concept, thus it is based on a future technology. Severe\n\nconstraints exist on real time relative motion knowledge (nanometer range and\n\nsub-microradian bearing) and control (sub-mm) and many challenges are in the\n\n382 M.D. Graziano\n\n\n\nfields of centralized and decentralized sensing, estimation and control. Apart from\n\nthe sunshade for the primary mirror, the other elements have a weight of 100 kg\n\n(primary mirror), 25 and 50 kg.\n\nA similar concept is proposed by Wertz [27]. In this case, the primary mirror is\n\nmade up by 96 2-m diameter close free-floating optical modules which all move on\n\nnear GEO orbit. The primary mirror is protected from Sun by an orbiting Sunshade,\n\nwhich is 170 m wide and 70 m high, and which is made by kapton. It keeps the\n\nprimary mirror at a temperature of 40 K. Wertz included in the system several\n\nexternal mirror element control units, which are used both for positioning knowl-\n\nedge and as control devices.\n\nA widely explored application for optical distributed missions is the interferom-\n\netry. The basic configuration foresees a certain number of spacecraft collectors,\n\nwhich reflect light towards the combiner satellite, able to combine the beams and\n\ngenerate an interference pattern.\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted in the last decades.\n\nDarwin [4] is an ESA study, consisting of four or five satellites with aim to\n\nsearch for Earth-like planets around other stars and analyze their atmospheres for\n\nchemical signatures of life. Three or four satellites work as collectors and reflect\n\nlight to the central spacecraft, by using a technique called \u201cnulling interferometry\u201d.\n\nThis technique implies that light coming from a planet is delayed and then com-\n\nbined to \u201cnull\u201d the starlight. Furthermore, Darwin system works also in \u201cimaging\n\nmode\u201d as a large telescope, with 100-m diameter, and the satellites flying in\n\nformation. In this case, a very high accuracy is required for relative positioning.\n\nThe study is actually completed and no future developments are foreseen.\n\nTerrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) [28] is a NASA project, to develop a system of\n\nsmall high sensitivity telescope, able to measure temperature, size and orbital\n\nparameters of Earth-like planets. The proposed configuration implies four large\n\n3.5-m telescopes using Michelson interferometry principles to cancel starlight and\n\ndetect only the light coming from the planet. The program has been postponed\n\nindefinitely.\n\nThe Stellar Imager (SI) [29] is another NASA project, to increase the knowl-\n\nedge of solar/stellar magnetic activity, and magnetic process, focusing on their role\n\nin the origin of life and on the evolution of the stars. The system is a UV-optical\n\ninterferometer for 0.1 milli-arcsecond spectral imaging of stellar surface, based on\n\n20\u201330 1-m primary mirrors distributed over a parabolic virtual surface. The focal\n\nlength varies from 1 km with 100 m-diameter array to 10 km with 1,000-diameter\n\narray. Two combiners have been suggested to increase the system redundancy and\n\nalso a \u201creference craft\u201d to perform metrology on the formation. The goal is to\n\nenable the mission in the last 2020s.\n\nSymbol-X [30] mission is a hard X-ray pointed telescope, based on two\n\nformation-flying platforms, the mirror and the detector, with a 44,000 km perigee\n\naltitude and 253,000 km apogee altitude to optimize global resources of both\n\nspacecrafts. The instrument, which foresees a 20\u201330 m focal length optics able to\n\nfocus energy up to at least 80 keV, can observe a large variety of astrophysical\n\nsources, depending on the observation time. Clearly, the formation flying requires a\n\n12 Overview of Distributed Missions 383\n\n\n\nprecise control of the relative positions. To this end a laser source is put onboard the\n\n\u201cdetector\u201d spacecraft to measure the line of sight of the beam reflected by a corner\n\ncube. Furthermore, also the formation guidance is located on the \u201cdetector\u201d,\n\nwhereas during not critical mission phases each satellite can communicate directly\n\nwith the ground. Unfortunately, due to CNES budget restriction, the program was\n\ncancelled in 2009.\n\n12.7 Technological Demonstration Missions\n\nSeveral missions and initiatives have been proposed to demonstrate the enabling\n\nformation flying technologies. In the following, some of more representative\n\ndemonstration programs are introduced, showing the main mission objectives.\n\n3CSat (Three Corner Satellite) [31, 32] is a project developed by Arizona State\n\nUniversity, University of Colorado and New Mexico State University. The three\n\nnanosatellites, called Sparky, Ralphie and Petey, are not attitude stabilized or\ncontrolled, so that the formation configuration degrades as mission evolves.\n\nThe mission main objectives are to take steroscopic clouds images, demonstrate\n\nformation flying and end-to-end command and data handling and it was the first to\n\nuse cellular phone technology for satellites communication. Because of weight and\n\nspace limitation of Boeing Delta IV Heavy rocket, only two of them were launched\n\nin 2004.\n\nFASTRAC (Formation Autonomy Spacecraft with Thrust, Relnav, Attitude and\n\nCrosslink) [33, 34] project was developed by University of Texas, and it was\n\nsponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The mission is composed\n\nof two 30 kg satellites: Sara Lily and Emma, launched in 2010 to investigate\nenabling technology for satellite formation. The only difference between the two\n\nsatellites is a micro-discharge plasma thruster located in Sara Lily where Emma\n\nhosts a MicroAerospace Solution Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to measure\n\nthe separation of the two satellites. The main technical mission objectives include\n\nthe verification of satellite communication data exchange, the demonstration of\n\nautonomous thruster operation and of on-orbit real time GPS relative navigation. In\n\naddition, a distributed ground station network has been used to communicate with\n\nthe satellites.\n\nCanX-4 and CanX-5 [35, 36] nanosatellites will perform an autonomous\n\nformation flying demonstration mission, developed by Canadian Advanced\n\nNanospace eXperiment (CanX). The two nanosatellites will fly with separation\n\ndistance from 50 to 1,000 m to demonstrate precision formation flying\n\ntechnologies, which include autonomous achievement and maintenance of different\n\nformation configurations, high accuracy relative position measurement by DGPS,\n\nsubmeter position control, fuel efficient algorithms and intersatellites communica-\n\ntion system.\n\nDuring mission phases, one satellite, \u201cdeputy\u201d, will perform all necessary\n\nmaneuvers to maintain the formation configuration, whereas the other satellite,\n\n384 M.D. Graziano\n\n\n\n\u201cchief\u201d, will adjust its attitude to be in the FOV of the same GPS satellites viewing\n\nthe deputy. CanX-4 and CanX-5 deployment, planned for the end of 2012, will be\n\nperformed by using the first XPOD Duo separation system, a \u201cjack-in-the-box\u201d\n\ncontainer able to eject nanosatellites from any launch vehicles by means of\n\nopening-door release mechanism.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Primary\n\nobjective of TanDEM-X is the acquisition of a global digital elevation model\n\n(DEM) with unprecedented accuracy and resolution (12 m horizontal and 2 m\n\nvertical resolution). Besides the primary mission goal, several secondary objectives\n\nbased on along-track interferometry and new bistatic SAR techniques have been\n\ndefined, representing a further important asset of the mission. TanDEM-X was\n\nsuccessfully launched in June 2010 and started operational data acquisition in\n\nDecember 2010. This chapter outlines the TanDEM-X mission concept and its\n\nimplementation, summarizes the main data processing and calibration steps, and\n\nprovides an overview of the actual performance and mission status. Furthermore,\n\nresults from several scientific experiments are presented, showing the great poten-\n\ntial of future formation flying interferometric SAR missions to serve a wide\n\nspectrum of novel applications.\n\n13.1 Introduction\n\nTanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement) opens a new\nera in spaceborne radar remote sensing. A single-pass SAR interferometer with\n\nadjustable baselines in cross and along-track directions is formed by adding a second,\n\nalmost identical spacecraft (TDX) to TerraSAR-X (TSX) and flying the two satellites\n\nin a closely controlled formation (see Fig. 13.1). Three years after TSX, TDX was\n\nlaunched in June 2010 and since December 2010 the two satellites are orbiting at\n\ntypical cross-track baselines between 200 and 400 m acquiring data for a global\n\nDigital ElevationModel (DEM)with 2m relative height accuracy at a 12mhorizontal\n\nposting. Beyond that primary mission objective, TanDEM-X provides a configurable\n\nSAR interferometry test bed for demonstrating new SAR techniques and applications.\n\nFig. 13.1 TDX and TSX flying in close formation over Europe\n\n388 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nDigital elevation models (DEMs) are of fundamental importance for a broad\n\nrange of commercial and scientific applications [1\u20133]. For example, many geosci-\n\nence areas like hydrology, glaciology, forestry, and geology require precise and up-\n\nto-date information about the Earth\u2019s surface and its topography. Digital maps are\n\nalso a prerequisite for reliable navigation, and improvements in their accuracy need\n\nto keep step with the advances in global positioning systems, like GPS and Galileo.\n\nIn principle, DEMs can be derived from a variety of airborne and spaceborne sensors\n\n[4, 5]. However, the resulting mosaic of data from different sources with a multitude\n\nof horizontal and vertical data, accuracies, formats, map projections, time\n\ndifferences and resolutions is hardly a uniform and reliable data set. The Shuttle\n\nRadar Topography Mission (SRTM, [6\u20138]) had hence the challenging goal to meet\n\nthe requirements for a homogeneous and reliable DEM fulfilling the DTED-2-\n\nspecification. The coverage of this DEM is, however, principally limited to a\n\nlatitude range from 56?S to 60?N due to the inclined orbit of the space shuttle and\nits mapping geometry. Further restrictions apply to the X-band DEM with its wide\n\ngaps at lower latitudes and the C-band DEM where the data are available to the\n\npublic only at an artificially impaired spatial resolution. A user survey among a wide\n\nrange of scientists and potential customers has clearly shown that many applications\n\nrequire both an extended latitudinal coverage and an improved accuracy comparable\n\nto DEMs generated by high-resolution airborne SAR systems [3]. Table 13.1\n\ncompares the specifications of the DTED-2 and TanDEM-X DEM standards.\n\nBeyond the generation of a global TanDEM-X DEM as the primary mission\n\ngoal, local DEMs of even higher accuracy level (posting of 6 m and relative vertical\n\naccuracy of 0.8 m) and applications based on Along-Track Interferometry (ATI)\n\nlike measurements of ocean currents are important secondary mission objectives.\n\nAlong-track interferometry will also allow for innovative applications to be\n\nexplored and can be performed by the so-called dual-receive antenna mode on\n\neach of the two satellites and/or by adjusting the along-track distance between TSX\n\nand TDX to the desired value. Combining both modes will provide a highly capable\n\nalong-track interferometer with four phase centres. The different ATI modes will\n\ne.g. be used for improved detection, localization and ambiguity resolution in ground\n\nmoving target indication and traffic monitoring applications.

Only 1 year later, 90% of the TanDEM-X DEM shall be available.\n\nThe baseline geometry in these first years is optimized for DEM performance. If\n\nthe baselines are suitable, a limited number of scientific acquisitions can be\n\nincluded already during this phase. After the DEM acquisitions even larger\n\nbaselines can be adjusted for higher accuracy DEMs on local scales and for the\n\nexploration and demonstration of scientific experiments.\n\n13.2 Mission Concept\n\n13.2.1 Helix Satellite Formation\n\nThe acquisition of the TanDEM-X DEM requires the coordinated operation of two\n\nsatellites flying in close formation. Several formation flying options have been\n\ninvestigated during the conceptual development phase [9\u201313], and the Helix satellite\n\nformation shown in Fig. 13.2 has finally been selected for operational DEM acquisi-\n\ntion [1]. This formation geometry implies maximum out-of-plane (cross-track) orbit\n\ncross-track\nbaseline\n\nradial\nbaseline\n\neffective\nbaselines\n(? = 45\u00b0)\n\nSH\n(descending)\n\n315270\n225\n\n180\n13590\n\n450\n\n360\nNH\n\n(ascending)\n\nFig. 13.2 Helix satellite formation for TanDEM-X. Left: illustration of the orbits. Right: cross-\ntrack and radial baselines as a function of the argument of latitude. The latitude positions\n\ncorrespond to one complete orbit (from 0? to 360?). The dashed line represents a virtual reference\norbit chosen by the midpoint between the two satellites\n\n390 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nseparation at the equator crossings by small ascending node differences and\n\nmaximum radial separation at the poles by slightly different eccentricity vectors.\n\nThis concept of relative eccentricity/inclination vector separation results in a helix-\n\nlike relative movement of the satellites along the orbit and provides a maximum\n\nlevel of passive safety in case of vanishing along-track separation. The Helix\n\nformation enables therefore an inherently safe spacecraft operation without the\n\nnecessity for autonomous control. It is furthermore possible to optimize the along-\n\ntrack displacement at predefined latitudes for different applications: cross-track\n\ninterferometry aims at along-track baselines which are as short as possible to ensure\n\nan optimum overlap of the Doppler spectra and to avoid temporal decorrelation in\n\nvegetated areas. Other applications like along-track interferometry or super resolu-\n\ntion require selectable along-track baselines in the range from hundred meters up to\n\nseveral kilometres. A fine tuning and maintenance of the satellite formation is\n\nperformed via a dedicated cold-gas propulsion system on TDX (cf. Sect. 13.3).\n\nThe Helix formation enables a complete mapping of the Earth with a stable\n\nheight of ambiguity by using a small number of formation settings [1]. Southern and\n\nnorthern latitudes can be mapped with the same formation by using ascending orbits\n\nfor one and descending orbits for the other hemisphere, as illustrated in Fig. 13.2 on\n\nthe right. To adjust the baselines, formation reconfiguration manoeuvres can be\n\nperformed by TDX employing hydrazine propulsion. Smaller, but more frequent\n\nformation maintenance manoeuvres are performed by the TDX cold gas propulsion\n\nsystem. These manoeuvres are required to counterbalance the natural drift of the\n\nrelative eccentricity vector, which would otherwise result in an additional change of\n\nthe cross-track baselines (cf. Sect. 13.6).\n\n13.2.2 Interferometric Modes\n\nInterferometric data acquisition with the TanDEM-X satellite formation can be\n\nachieved in different cooperative modes: Examples are bistatic, monostatic, and\n\nalternating bistatic operation which are illustrated in Fig. 13.3. The three interfero-\n\nmetric configurations may further be combined with different TSX and TDX SAR\n\nFig. 13.3 Data acquisition modes for TanDEM-X: Pursuit monostatic mode (left), bistatic mode\n(middle), and alternating bistatic mode (right)\n\n13 TanDEM-X 391\n\n\n\nimaging modes like Stripmap, ScanSAR, and Spotlight (Sect. 13.3). Operational\n\nDEM generation is performed using the bistatic Stripmap mode shown in the\n\nmiddle of Fig. 13.3. This mode uses either TSX or TDX as a transmitter to\n\nilluminate a common radar footprint on the Earth\u2019s surface. The scattered signal\n\nis then simultaneously recorded by both satellites. This synchronised data acquisi-\n\ntion makes dual use of the available transmit power and is mandatory to avoid\n\npossible errors from temporal decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances.\n\n13.2.3 Exclusion Zones\n\nFor DEM generation, TanDEM-X combines one monostatic and one bistatic radar\n\nimage in a joint SAR interferogram. To ensure a sufficient overlap of the Doppler\n\nspectra, this requires a short along-track distance of typically less than 1 kmbetween the\n\ntwo satellites. The radial and cross-track baselines depend on the argument of latitude\n\nandvary between zero and a fewhundredmeters.As a result, there is the danger that one\n\nsatellite illuminates the other satellite by its transmitted radar pulses. This could cause\n\ninterference, or, in the worst case, damage of sensitive electronic equipment. To avoid\n\nthis risk, the transmission of radar signals has to be suppressed for one satellite at\n\nspecific arguments of latitude, which are known as exclusion zones (cf. Fig. 13.4).\n\nTanDEM-X ensures exclusion zone compliance by a double fail-safe approach\n\nincluding both a check on ground before command uploading and an additional\n\nreal-time check on the satellite which suppresses signal transmission within\n\npredefined latitude windows (Sect. 13.3).\n\nFig. 13.4 TanDEM-X exclusion zones. Note that in the figure on the left TSX has been chosen\n\nas a fixed reference instead of the midpoint between TSX and TDX as in Fig. 13.2\n\n392 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\n13.2.4 Radar Synchronisation\n\nA peculiarity of the bistatic data acquisition is the use of independent oscillators for\n\nmodulation and demodulation of the radar pulses. Any deviation between the two\n\noscillators causes a residual modulation of the recorded radar echoes. The impact of\n\noscillator phase noise in bistatic SAR has been analyzed in Ref. [14] where it is\n\nshown that oscillator noise may cause significant errors in both the interferometric\n\nphase and SAR focusing. The stringent requirements for interferometric phase\n\nstability in the bistatic mode will hence require an appropriate relative phase\n\nreferencing between the two SAR instruments or an operation in the alternating\n\nbistatic mode. For TanDEM-X, a dedicated inter-satellite X-band synchronisation\n\nlink has been established via mutual exchange of radar pulses between the two\n\nsatellites (Sect. 13.3). For this, the nominal bistatic SAR data acquisition is\n\ninterrupted for some transmit pulses, and the radar signal is redirected from the\n\nmain SAR antenna to one of six dedicated synchronisation horn antennas mounted\n\non each spacecraft. The pulse is then recorded by the other satellite which in turn\n\ntransmits a synchronisation pulse (cf. Fig. 13.5, left). This technique allows for\n\nmutual phase referencing without exact knowledge of the actual distance between\n\nthe satellites. On ground, a correction signal can then be derived from the recorded\n\nsynchronisation pulses. This compensates the oscillator induced phase errors in the\n\nbistatic SAR signal. The performance of such a synchronisation link has been\n\ninvestigated in Ref. [15]. The right hand side of Fig. 13.5 shows the predicted\n\nstandard deviation of the residual phase errors after synchronisation as a function of\n\nthe repetition frequency of the synchronisation events for different signal-to-noise\n\nratios (SNR) of the bidirectional link. The actual SNR varies with the distance\n\nbetween the satellites as well as with their relative attitude. For the typical DEM\n\nFig. 13.5 Synchronisation of TanDEM-X satellites by exchange or radar pulses (left)\nand predicted performance (right). The performance is shown in terms of the standard deviation\nof the total synchronisation link phase error as a function of the synchronisation frequency with\n\nsignal-to-noise ratio as a parameter\n\n13 TanDEM-X 393\n\n\n\ndata acquisition mode with baselines below 1 km, the SNR will be in the order of\n\n30\u201340 dB, and it becomes clear that a phase error below 1? can be achieved for\nsynchronisation frequencies above 5 Hz.\n\n13.2.5 Interferometric Performance and Data Acquisition Plan\n\nRadar interferometry is based on the evaluation of the phase difference between two\n\ncoherent radar signals acquired from slightly different spatial and/or temporal\n\npositions. By this, TanDEM-X is able to measure the range difference from\n\nthe two satellites to a given scatterer with millimetric accuracy. The height of the\n\nscatterer is inferred from this range difference by geometric triangulation.\n\nThe sensitivity of the phase-to-height scaling depends on the distance between\n\nthe two satellites, where a larger baseline increases the sensitivity of the radar\n\ninterferometer to small height variations. However, the conversion from phase to\n\nrange and hence the conversion of phase differences to height is not unique, since\n\nthe range difference measurement via phases is ambiguous with the wavelength.\n\nRadar interferometry expresses this ambiguity by the so called height of ambiguity\n\nhamb \u00bc lr0 sin yi\u00f0 \u00de\nB?\n\n(13.1)\n\nwhere l is the wavelength, r0 the slant range from the satellites to the scatterer under\nconsideration, yi the local incident angle of the electromagnetic wave, and B? is the\nperpendicular baseline. The value of B? can be approximately obtained by\nprojecting the vector connecting both satellites onto a plane normal to the master\n\nsatellite\u2019s orbit and then again onto a plane perpendicular to the line of sight.\n\nFigure 13.6 shows the predicted height accuracy as a function of ground range\n\nposition and the height of ambiguity (cf. [1] for details). It becomes clear that a\n\nlower height of ambiguity (i.e. larger baseline B?) improves the height accuracy.\nHowever, a lower height of ambiguity also increases the difficulties in selecting the\n\ncorrect ambiguity interval during DEM generation (phase unwrapping). To mini-\n\nmize such problems and to ensure a homogeneous performance, TanDEM-X\n\ncombines acquisitions with different heights of ambiguity. This requires in turn\n\nfrequent adjustments of the Helix formation parameters which are selected\n\naccording to an optimized global data acquisition plan (Sect. 13.5). Important\n\nconstraints in this challenging optimization procedure are besides the interferomet-\n\nric performance the available amount of fuel and thruster cycles, limitations in the\n\nonboard storage and downlink capacity in combination with the finite time period\n\nfor global DEM acquisition, as well as power and thermal constraints [16\u201318].\n\nFurther challenges arise from the interleaved usage of both satellites for the\n\nundisturbed continuation of the TerraSAR-X mission.\n\n394 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\n13.3 Space Segment\n\nThe TanDEM-X (TDX) satellite is essentially a rebuild of the TerraSAR-X (TSX)\n\nsatellite [19]. The 5 m long satellite structure has a hexagonal cross-section. One\n\nside carries the 4.8 ? 0.8 m body-mounted SAR antenna which points to the Earth\non the right side of the satellite subtrack. The sun-synchronous dusk-dawn orbit\n\nallows the use of a solar array which is fixed on the sun-pointing side of the satellite.\n\nSAR measurement data are transmitted to ground stations using an X-band antenna\n\nmounted at the tip of a 3.3 m long boom (Fig. 13.7). In addition to the four 1-\n\nNewton engines based hydrazine propulsion system for orbit maintenance which is\n\navailable on both satellites, a high-pressure Nitrogen cold gas system is\n\naccommodated on TDX, providing the necessary small impulses based on 40 mN\n\nnozzles to support the fine relative orbit control of TDX for the close formation\n\nflight.\n\nThe X-band (9.65 GHz) radar is based on an active antenna using an array of\n\ntransmit-receive modules which provides rapid electronic beam steering and pro-\n\ngrammable antenna patterns (Fig. 13.8). Each module feeds a sub-array comprising\n\ntwo slotted-waveguides, one for vertical and the other for horizontal polarization.\n\nThe waveguides are based on metalized carbon fibre reinforced plastic to give high\n\ninherent stability under all operating conditions.\n\nNominally, three basic modes of instrument operation are used:\n\n30 35 4540\n\nIncident Angle [deg]\n\noptimum combination of all swaths\n\nhamb = 45 m\n\nhamb = 30 m\n\nGround Range [km]\n300\n\n0\n350 400 450 500\n\n1\n\n2\n\nH\nei\n\ngh\nt E\n\nrr\nor\n\n [m\n]\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFig. 13.6 Predicted relative height accuracy for a height of ambiguity of 45 m (dotted) and 30 m\n(dashed). The lower solid curve shows the error resulting from the combination of multiple swaths.\nAll errors are point-to-point height errors for a 90% confidence interval assuming scattering from\n\nbare rock and soil surfaces. First results from the TanDEM-X commissioning phase show a good\n\nagreement with the performance model (cf. Sect. 13.9)\n\n13 TanDEM-X 395\n\n\n\nFig. 13.7 Artist view of the TerraSAR-X satellite. Note the solar panel (upper left), the boom\n(lower left) with the X-band downlink antenna, and the X-band radar antenna (lower right)\n\nFig. 13.8 TanDEM-X antenna panel with 32 slotted waveguide subarrays. Each subarray is fed\n\nby an individual transmit/receive (T/R) module. The full SAR antenna consists of 12 panels\n\n396 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Stripmap is the standard mode of operation, providing a resolution of 3 m and a\n\nswath width of 30 km on ground.\n\n\u2022 In Spotlight mode, azimuth (along-track) scanning of the radar beam allows to\n\nimprove the resolution to 1 m for the measurement of scene \u2018patches\u2019 of about\n\n10 ? 10 km.\n\u2022 In ScanSAR mode, elevation (cross-track) scanning of the radar beam allows to\n\nincrease the swath width to 100 km with a resolution of better than 16 m.\n\nThe SAR transmit/receive signal routing to the antenna front-end and simultaneous\n\nuse of the redundant Central Electronics allows separate radar reception for each\n\nalong-track half of an antenna. This Dual Receive Antenna (DRA)mode enables fully\n\npolarimetric measurements and along-track interferometry. The architecture also\n\nprovides a routing for calibration signals through the whole chain of hardware\n\ninvolved in transmission and receptionwith the exception of the radiatingwaveguides.\n\nOn-ground processing of the calibration signals derives replicas for optimized pulse\n\ncompression and amplitude correction factors enabling high measurement stability.\n\nThe TDX Solid State Mass Memory capacity is 768 Gbit which is doubled\n\ncompared with TSX to support the collection of the enormous amount of DEM data.\n\nIn preparation of the TanDEM-X mission the TSX radar antenna design was\n\nextended to allow exchange of so-called \u201cSync Pulses\u201d to support coherent opera-\n\ntion of the two SAR instruments during bi-static operation. Six synchronisation\n\nhorn antennas on each satellite, fed by transmit-receive modules of the intermediate\n\namplifiers, provide a quasi-omnidirectional coverage.\n\nTDX and TSX carry the Tracking, Occultation and Ranging (TOR) equipment\n\nprovided by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Potsdam. TOR\n\nconsists of the dual frequency Integrated GPS Occultation Receiver (IGOR)\n\ntogether with occultation antennas and a laser reflector. Ground processing\n\n(see Sects. 13.7 and 13.10) of the IGOR data from both satellites allows the accurate\n\ndetermination of the interferometric baseline as needed for the DEM generation.\n\nFor DEM data collection, formation flight is necessary with satellite\n\nseparations down to 150 m. This infers risk of collision of the satellites and risk\n\nof mutual illumination by the main beams of the radar antennas. A number of\n\nsafety mechanisms have been introduced in the satellites design to safeguard\n\nagainst these risks:\n\n\u2022 Beyond the original hydrazine thrusters based safe mode an additional safe mode\n\nbased on use of the magnet-torquers is introduced on both satellites. This avoids\n\nchange in altitude in case of a safemode dropwhich could occur infrequently due to\n\nsingle event upsets caused e.g. by radiation andwhich increases the risk of collision.\n\n\u2022 DEM data collection is performed in bistatic operation where one radar transmits\n\nand both radars receive the radar signals. Radar transmission is allocated opera-\n\ntionally to that satellite in the deterministic Helix formation having no risk to\n\nilluminate the partner satellite. Radar transmission by the other satellite is\n\nprevented within this part of the orbit by an onboard \u2018exclusion zone\u2019 logic\n\nusing the actual orbit position determined on board. A similar logic is used in the\n\nGround Segment to avoid planning of such dangerous operations.\n\n13 TanDEM-X 397\n\n\n\n\u2022 Each SAR transmit-receive chain is diverted to form a communication link using\n\na pair of synchronisation horns, one of six on each satellite. Detection of a poor\n\nreceive signal level is used by a so-called sync warning logic to immediately\n\nsuppress radar transmission since the cause could be an unexpected orbit posi-\n\ntion (e.g. caused by a safe mode drop or a failure in an orbit manoeuvre\n\nexecution) of the partner satellite which could result in radar illumination.\n\n\u2022 An Inter-Satellite Link Receiver & Decoder is accommodated as additional\n\nhardware on TDX. This allows TDX to \u2018listen\u2019 to the TSX low rate S-band\n\ntelemetry. In case TSX is reporting to be in safe mode state, TDX suppresses its\n\nradar transmission and as such preventing the risk of radar illumination of TSX.\n\n13.4 Ground Segment Architecture\n\nThe TanDEM-X ground segment is built on top of the existing TerraSAR-X ground\n\nsegment [20] thus providing an integrated solution for two very different system tasks:\n\n\u2022 The systematic acquisition and generation of a global DEMover several years and\n\n\u2022 The provision of high-resolution single scene SAR products from various imag-\n\ning and polarisation modes to commercial and science users on a daily basis.\n\nFigure 13.9 provides an overview of the joint TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X\n\nground segment which consists of three major sub-segments:\n\n\u2013 Mission Operations Segment (MOS),\n\n\u2013 Instrument Operations and Calibration Segment (IOCS),\n\n\u2013 Payload Ground Segment (PGS).\n\nThe challenging TanDEM-X mission concept as described in Sect. 13.2 required\n\nthe introduction of several new and highly innovative elements in all three\n\nsub-segments [21]:\n\n\u2022 A TanDEM-X Acquisition Planner was added to IOCS. This element provides\n\nthe long-term acquisition plan for the global DEM and the TanDEM-X scientific\n\ndata takes (cf. Sect. 13.5).To support the planning, a new functionality was added\nwhich systematically predicts and monitors the interferometric performance\n\n(cf. Sect. 13.9).\n\n\u2022 The IOCS Radar Parameter and Instrument Command Generators were\n\nextended to provide satellite specific instrument command sets for bistatic and\n\ninterferometric data takes. This includes the generation and monitoring of\n\nsynchronisation pulses that are exchanged between the two satellites.\n\n\u2022 The IOCS Calibration element was extended to calibrate and deal with the\n\npeculiarities of the bistatic and interferometric modes (cf. Sect. 13.10).\n\n\u2022 The MOS Mission Planning System was enhanced to generate combined\n\nTerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X mission timelines using both satellites.\n\n398 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The MOS Flight Dynamics System was extended to support the TanDEM-X\n\nformation flight which poses new needs for spacecraft navigation and control\n\n(Sect. 13.6).\n\n\u2022 A new element for precise baseline estimation has been added to MOS. The\n\nbaseline products are provided by two independent entities (Sect. 13.7).\n\n\u2022 A network of ground stations located at appropriate geographical locations\n\n(DLR\u2019s German Antarctica Receiving Station at O\u2019Higgins, DLR\u2019s Inuvik\n\nSatellite Station in Canada, DLR\u2019s ERIS Chetumal Station in Mexico, and the\n\npartner ground station SSC ESRANGE Kiruna in Sweden) was added to down-\n\nlink a TanDEM-X data volume of about 350 TByte in 3 years of operation.\n\n\u2022 An automated chain for the systematic reception, archiving and processing of\n\nthe TanDEM-X SAR acquisitions into individual \u201craw\u201d DEMs and their final\n\nmosaicking into the global DEM product was added to PGS. For this, an\n\nIntegrated TanDEM-X Processor (ITP) was developed to process the TanDEM-\n\nX SAR raw data into \u201craw\u201d DEMs in an automated way (Sect. 13.8).

Ordering a TanDEM-X product means\n\nrequesting a copy of the systematically processed and archived data in form of a\n\ncatalogue product. Commissioning of the challenging TanDEM-X mission on top\n\nof TerraSAR-X and thus the release of the joint TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X ground\n\nsegment for routine operation was done in parallel to the technical system verifica-\n\ntion. Since the end of 2010, the innovative ground segment is fully operational and\n\nsuccessfully supports both missions.\n\n13.5 Global DEM Acquisition Plan\n\n13.5.1 Introduction to DEM Acquisition Planning\n\nIn order to generate a global DEM with the specification as described in Sect. 13.1\n\nmore than 10,000 interferometric image pairs need to be acquired. Each of these\n\ndata takes has to fulfill its performance requirements. The TanDEM-X satellites\n\nallow interferometric Stripmap acquisitions with a swath width of around 30 km.\n\nConsidering the 11-day repeat orbit this requires nine adjacent swaths in order to\n\nmap the complete ground area at the equator. Further north and south the number of\n\nrequired adjacent swaths reduces since the ground distance from one orbit to the\n\nnext gets smaller. Figure 13.10 shows the acquired area for the TanDEM-X global\n\nDEM until August 2011. The composition of the individual acquisitions with a\n\ntypical data take length of 1,000\u20131,500 km is visible. This plot reveals in addition\n\nthat the southern area is acquired earlier which is the effect of height of ambiguity\n\nasymmetry between ascending and descending orbits. This asymmetry is due to the\n\nnon-vanishing along-track baseline at the equator in combination with Earth\n\nrotation.\n\n13.5.2 Height of Ambiguity as Key Planning Parameter\n\nThe primary performance parameter for the acquisition planning is the Height of\n\nAmbiguity (HoA), see Sect. 13.2.5. The smaller the HoA the better is the relative\n\nheight error but the more difficult is the phase unwrapping. In addition, smaller\n\nHoAs cause a loss of coherence over areas which are subject to volume\n\ndecorrelation. Therefore, the selection of the optimal HoA for the TanDEM-X\n\nDEM acquisitions is a balancing act.\n\n400 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nSince the overall mission time allows for at least two global acquisitions, it is\n\nforeseen to acquire each area with two different HoA values:\n\n\u2022 A first acquisition has been performed in 2011 with a HoA between 45 and 60 m\n\ndepending on the terrain type. This ensures a robust phase unwrapping.\n\n\u2022 A second acquisition with a smaller HoA of around 35\u201345 m is planned to be\n\nfinished by the end of 2012 in order to improve the relative height error.\n\nIn the planning of the data takes the acquisition geometry has to be considered to\n\nachieve the required HoA. The different swaths will be acquired using satellite look\n\nangles between 28? and 44? (corresponding to incident angles between 30? and 48?).\nDepending on the look angle the HoA changes since the effective baseline, the slant\n\nrange and the incident angle are different (cf. (13.1)). In addition, the acquisition\n\ngeometry changes constantly during the orbit (argument of latitude) as the satellites\n\nare flying in a Helix formation (see Sect. 13.2). This means that the resulting\n\nheight of ambiguity depends on the used beam and the orbit position. Figure 13.11\n\nshows the variation of the HoA for a typical TanDEM-X Helix formation.\n\n13.5.3 Acquisition Planning\n\nIn order to generate theDEMacquisition plan the limited satellite resources have to be\n\ntaken into account. The driving resource parameters are raw data downlink capacity,\n\navailable onboard memory and the power/thermal constraints of the satellites.\n\nFig. 13.10 TanDEM-X DEM acquisitions. The colour coded polygons show the DEM\n\nacquisitions until August 26, 2011. The colours indicate the different swaths. The zoom in the\nlower left corner shows the connection area between ascending and descending acquisitions at\n\nthe equator. The zoom in lower right corner shows the overlap between adjacent acquisitions.\nIn total, nine different swaths are required in each orbit to map the entire area at the equator\n\n13 TanDEM-X 401\n\n\n\nThese were modelled and considered during the generation of the TanDEM-X DEM\n\nacquisition plan.\n\nThe generation of the DEM acquisition plan comprises the following steps:\n\n\u2022 Step 1: Calculation of orbit/swath combinations: During this process the\n\ndesired ground area (e.g. complete Earth surface) is transformed into a list of\n\norbit positions and corresponding swaths which need to be acquired.\n\n\u2022 Step 2: Formation selection: The formation parameters are derived by calculat-\n\ning the HoA for each possible acquisition and comparing it against the target HoA\n\nof this acquisition. This is performed for several different formations iteratively\n\nuntil an optimum formation is found. Figure 13.12 shows the height of ambiguity\n\ntogether with the formation parameters during the first global acquisition in 2011.\n\nIt can be seen that while the formation changes the HoA remains approximately\n\nconstant since the acquisitions are performed with different swaths and\n\nfrom different orbit positions. In October 2011, a very small formation was\n\nentered to allow the acquisition of difficult terrain which requires a higher HoA.\n\n\u2022 Step 3: Determination of exact acquisition times: In the determination of the\n\nacquisition times data takes are sequentially selected. All possible acquisitions\n\nare evaluated w.r.t. the available resources using a point model. The point model\n\nconsiders performance aspects like the HoA as well as operational constraints\n\nlike the maximum acquisition duration or a possibility for a later execution.\n\nSteps 2 and 3 are performed for each repeat orbit cycle separately. The result is\n\nthe exact timeline of all acquisitions.\n\n\u2022 Step 4: Detailed acquisition parameter calculation: With the information of\n\nthe acquisition times and the flown Helix formation it is now possible to\n\ncalculate the detailed acquisition parameters. This results in multiple sets\n\nof acquisition parameters like e.g. different pulse repetition frequencies and\n\nFig. 13.11 Height of ambiguity as a function of look angle and orbit position (example for a\n\nformation with the following parameters: radial: 300 m, horizontal cross-track: 250 m, libration\n\nangle: 190?)\n\n402 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\ndifferent data compression settings, leading to different interferometric perfor-\n\nmance and satellite/downlink resources consumption.\n\n\u2022 Step 5: Height error prediction: For each acquisition possibility of step 4 a\n\nperformance prediction is evaluated using the performance model described in\n\nSect. 13.2 as well as empirical data retrieved during the TanDEM-X\n\ncommissioning phase.\n\n\u2022 Step 6: Height error optimization: The last step of the DEM acquisition\n\nplanning is the final selection of the acquisition considering the available\n\nsatellite and downlink resources and the height error prediction. Figure 13.13\n\nshows the height error reduction due to the optimization in step 6.\n\n13.6 Formation Control\n\n13.6.1 Orbit Control Concept\n\nSince June 2007 the TSX satellite is operated in a sun-synchronous dusk-dawn\n\norbit (97.44? inclination, 514 km altitude, frozen eccentricity) with a 167 orbits\nor 11-day repeat cycle. The TSX osculating orbit is maintained within a maxi-\n\nmum absolute cross-track distance of 250 m from a target Earth-fixed reference\n\ntrajectory, which comprises of exactly matching states at beginning and end of\n\nthe 11-day cycle enabling highly repeatable data take conditions [22, 23].

This\n\nground-control strategy is foreseen for the entire TSX lifetime including the\n\nperiod of formation flying with TDX, which was launched in June 2010. Thus\n\nformation acquisition and maintenance manoeuvres are exclusively performed by\n\nthe TDX satellite.\n\nBecause of the near-circular low-Earth orbit and the mutual distance on the\n\norder of 1 km, linearized equations can be used to describe the TDX-TSX relative\n\nmotion. The model employed builds upon the well-known Clohessy-Wiltshire-\n\nHill equations [24] but employs relative orbital elements as independent\n\nparameters and accounts for J2 perturbations. The use of relative eccentricity\n\nand inclination vector separation for formation design, the so-called Helix\n\nformation, enables safe proximity operations and a flexible adjustment of the\n\ninterferometric baseline [13].\n\nThe starting point of TSX-TDX formation control operations is the TanDEM-X\n\nacquisition plan (TAP, cf. Sect. 13.5.3), which contains the timeline of formation\n\ngeometries and corresponding planned bistatic SAR acquisitions. The target for-\n\nmation parameters are provided to Flight Dynamics (FD), where they are converted\n\ninto relative orbital elements before applying them within the formation control\n\nprocess. All formation geometries flown within the first year of routine DEM\n\nacquisition are depicted in Fig. 13.14.\n\nFor the purpose of relative navigation within FD, the filtering of GPS navigation\n\nsolution data is preferred to the processing of raw pseudorange and/or carrier phase\n\ndata (cf. Sect. 13.7). In that way the amount of auxiliary information is significantly\n\nreduced leading to higher robustness with sufficient relative orbit determination\n\naccuracy of typically <0.5 m in cross-track (2D, RMS) and <1 m (RMS) in along-\ntrack direction [25].\n\nH\nei\n\ngh\nt E\n\nrr\nor\n\n [m\n]\n\nAcquisition Number\n\nFig. 13.13 Comparison of the predicted height errors before and after optimization for full\n\nexploitation of the available satellite and downlink resources for the second half of the first\n\nDEM acquisition year\n\n404 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nIn order to meet the required formation control accuracy (Table 13.2) TDX\n\nmust both replicate the TSX orbit keeping manoeuvres and compensate the\n\nnatural deviation of the relative eccentricity and inclination vectors. While the\n\ncm/s-level absolute orbit maintenance is performed with four 1-Newton hydrazine\n\nthrusters, two pairs of 40 mN cold gas thrusters are used exclusively onboard\n\nTDX for in-plane formation control including counterbalancing of along-track\n\ndrifts, which result from differential hydrazine manoeuvre execution errors. The\n\nless frequent but larger out-of-plane manoeuvres are performed with hydrazine\n\npropellant. Precautions are implemented within FD planning process to ensure\n\nthat the failure of any TSX or TDX manoeuvres cannot result in a dangerous\n\nrelative motion [26].\n\n13.6.2 Formation Control Performance\n\nAfter acquisition of the 20 km wide formation in July 2010 (cf. [27] for details on\n\nthe acquisition process) the commissioning of the FD formation maintenance\n\nfunction was successfully performed. Because of the achieved excellent control\n\nFig. 13.14 Evolution of TDX-TSX relative motion in the Hill frame: radial-/along-track separa-\n\ntion (left) and radial/normal separation (right).

The filled black circle indicates the TDX relative position\nat 90? argument of latitude\n\nTable 13.2 Required and achieved formation control performance in different operation\n\nscenarios: mean/standard deviation [m] in radial, normal and along-track direction\n\nRadial Normal Along-Track\n\nRequirement 0.0/20.0 0.0/20.0 0.0/200.0\n\nCoarse ground-control with hydrazine, 3 days man. cycle,\nAug.\u2013Sept. 2010\n\n0.1/13.8 0.0/2.3 34.3/140.6\n\nRoutine ground-control with cold-gas, 24 h man. cycle,\nsince Oct. 2010\n\n0.0/5.2 0.0/0.9 ?0.2/25.4\n\nFirst TAFF test campaign with cold-gas, 8 h man. cycle,\nMar. 2011\n\n0/2.8 (0.0/2.9) ?4.7/13.9\n\nNote: TAFF is not able to perform out-of-plane control, so only radial and along-track accuracies\n\nreflect the TAFF performance\n\n13 TanDEM-X 405\n\n\n\naccuracy and in order to safe precious cold-gas for a likely mission extension, it was\n\ndecided to make use of the TDX hydrazine propulsion system to control the 20 km\n\nalong-track formation during the remaining time of the mono-static commissioning\n\nphase. The hereby achieved performance (Table 13.2) was fully sufficient for the\n\npurpose of calibrating the TDX radar instrument for mono-static operation and\n\nsurprisingly accurate considering the fact that only two formation maintenance\n\nmanoeuvre pairs were performed per week.\n\nShortly after acquiring the tight formation with zero mean along-track separation\n\nin October 2010 the ground-based formation control process became fully\n\nautomated. Since then daily formation maintenance manoeuvre pairs with cold-\n\ngas propulsion have been performed. Although the control concept primarily aims\n\non the maintenance of the relative eccentricity vector, the precise control of the\n\nalong-track separation is fundamental for the purpose of SAR cross-track interfer-\n\nometry, too. The remarkable control performance achieved is summarized in\n\nTable 13.2. Because of the J2-induced drift of the relative eccentricity vector\n\n(i.e. tilt of the relative motion ellipse), a perfect alignment with the target relative\n\nargument of perigee is only achieved in the middle of a manoeuvre cycle. A better\n\nradial control performance can therefore only be achieved when further decreasing\n\nthe manoeuvre cycle as foreseen with the TanDEM-X Autonomous Formation\n\nFlying System (TAFF, cf. [28] for more details), which makes use of nearly\n\npermanent availability of real-time relative navigation provided through an inter-\n\nsatellite link. The results of the very first TAFF campaign performed in March\n\n2011, where three formation maintenance manoeuvre pairs per day were autono-\n\nmously planned and executed onboard TDX, impressively complete the relation\n\nbetween manoeuvre-cycle and achievable control accuracy (Table 13.2).\n\n13.7 Precise Baseline Estimation\n\n13.7.1 DGPS Approaches for Precise Relative 3-D Navigation\n\nThe methods for determining precise baselines have been explained in detail in\n\nSect. 5.4.2 above. In the TanDEM-X ground segment three approaches have been\n\nimplemented to operationally provide baseline products by the two institutes\n\nGerman Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) and the German Aerospace Center\n\n(DLR):\n\n\u2022 The GFZ solution called GFZ based on the EPOS-OC software [29],\n\n\u2022 The GFZ solution called GFZB based on the BERNESE software [30],\n\n\u2022 The DLR solution called MOS based on the FRNS software [31].\n\nBy having three independent software solutions it is possible to control the\n\nquality of the individual solutions, to monitor the long-term stability of the biases,\n\nand to eventually merge the solutions into a single one for improved accuracy.\n\n406 G. Krieger et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-5\n\n\n13.7.2 Baseline Combination\n\nFor the TanDEM-X mission three independent baseline solutions are generated as\n\ndiscussed above. All three solutions are subject to calibration and merging as\n\ndepicted in Fig. 13.15.\n\nFirstly, all different solutions are calibrated based on bias values inferred from\n\ndedicated SAR data takes over well-known test areas. From this the biases of the\n\nradial and normal component of the baseline vector can be determined and applied.\n\nSecondly, outlier detection is performed by comparison of the three precise\n\nbaselines. The outlying solution can then be corrected for or excluded from the\n\nnext step.\n\nThirdly and finally, the different solutions are combined in order to minimize the\n\nstochastic errors inherent to all individual solutions. Because of some non-\n\nrecoverable systematic content in the error spectrum, the error of the combined\n\nbaseline cannot be fully decreased by the square root of 3 as expected for indepen-\n\ndent error propagation. Experience from the GRACE mission baseline combination\n\nallows to assess the improvement at approximately 20%.\n\nThe results of the comparisons of the MOS and GFZ baseline solutions for a\n\nperiod of 1 year are presented in Fig. 13.16 for the radial direction and in Fig. 13.17\n\nfor the normal direction. In both figures solely the differences of the solutions that\n\nwent into the merging process are displayed. Each dot in the figures shows the\n\nmean, standard deviation or RMS value of the differences per product, i.e. for half a\n\nday or approximately 44,000 differences. The very stable radial bias of the solutions\n\nbecomes obvious in the mean values of the differences over time which happen to\n\nbe close to zero here. The bias in the normal direction is less stable than the radial\n\none but still better than a millimetre in terms of variability of the mean values.\n\nFig. 13.15 Baseline generation, calibration, and merging chain\n\n13 TanDEM-X 407\n\n\n\nThe standard deviations depicted in Figs. 13.16 and 13.17 are measures of short\n\nterm precision, the RMS values include biases as well.\n\nTable 13.3 gives an overview of the stability of the biases of the different\n\nsolutions and global standard deviations as a measure of precision. Concluding\n\nfrom Table 13.3 the merged baselines exhibit an accuracy of 1 mm RMS (if the\n\nbiases are properly taken care of) and therefore comply with the mission\n\nrequirements.\n\nFig. 13.16 Comparison of the MOS and GFZ baseline products in radial direction. Due to the low\n\nmean difference, the values for RMS and standard deviation are almost coincident\n\nFig. 13.17 Comparison of the MOS and GFZ baseline products in normal direction\n\n408 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\n13.8 Data Processing\n\nThe Integrated TanDEM-X Processor (ITP) is the heart of the SAR data workflow\n\nin the payload data ground segment, responsible for screening, focusing, interfero-\n\nmetric processing and finally the generation of \u201craw\u201d DEMs from the bistatic raw\n\ndata of the two instruments [32\u201334]. It also processes experimental acquisitions in\n\ndifferent modes to user products for the scientific community. A raw DEM\n\nprocessing example is shown in Fig. 13.18 together with the interim SAR image\n\nand interferogram. The data have been acquired in bistatic mode in December 2010\n\nand cover a 30 km by 50 km part of North Greenland. The terrain height ranges\n\nTable 13.3 Stability and precision of all baseline products\n\nSolutions Direction Mean (mm) Standard deviation (mm)\n\nGFZ\u2013MOS Radial 0.1 ? 0.1 0.9\nNormal 1.7 ? 0.3 0.8\n\nGFZB\u2013MOS Radial ?1.3 ? 0.4 0.8\nNormal ?1.0 ? 0.4 0.5\n\nFig. 13.18 SAR amplitude, interferogram and shaded colour coded raw DEM scene acquired over\n\nNorth Greenland\n\n13 TanDEM-X 409\n\n\n\nfrom sea level up to 1,750 m. Each fringe of the flattened interferogram corresponds\n\nto a 58 m height change.\n\n13.8.1 Processing Challenges\n\nMore than 500,000 km2 of the Earth surface acquired at 3 m resolution have to be\n\nprocessed each day in order to be in line with the new acquisitions. Thus, the main\n\nrequirements on the processing systems are to achieve high throughputs while\n\nmaintaining the highest possible accuracy at a fully autonomous processing and\n\nself-calibration approach without any dependencies on external reference data or\n\nhuman interaction. The very demanding height accuracy targeted for the final\n\nDEM, which implicates the use of very small heights of ambiguity, causes as a\n\ndraw back a significant amount of raw DEMs (10\u201315%) of complicated terrain to\n\nexhibit areas with so called phase unwrapping errors. These systematic local height\n\ndiscrepancies are solved for by an iterative processing loop using additional\n\nacquisitions of the same area in later mission phases. Thus depending on the\n\naccuracy and stability of the overall system calibration, the final DEMs provided\n\nby the ITP are expected to exhibit only very small residual height offsets in the\n\nrange of cm to meters which are later measured and compensated by the mosaicking\n\nand calibration processor (Sect. 13.11) with the help of reference height informa-\n\ntion, operator interactions and consistency checks. For each processing run exten-\n\nsive quality analysis results are provided for system performance monitoring.\n\nThe ITP also performs a quality screening of each downlinked DEM data take at\n\nthe receiving stations to provide a fast feedback for acquisition planning, archival\n\nand system monitoring.\n\n13.8.2 Principle of DEM Generation\n\nThe approach of the ITP to use the self-consistency of the data for pre-calibration of\n\nthe raw DEMs can be explained best when recalling the basic principle of DEM\n\ngeneration: measuring the distances to a point on ground from two different and\n\nprecisely known positions in space. In optical data processing, one can exploit the\n\nparallactic angles between such two stereo images. This is not possible in radar\n\nimaging, based on ranging from wave front signal travel times without sufficient\n\nangular resolution. Thus the triangulation is made from the different delays in the\n\nreceive times of the radar echoes visible as shifts in the images. This method is\n\ncalled radargrammetry and is well established for very large baselines with\n\ncorresponding macroscopic image shifts. If the cross-track baselines are small\n\nenough, the two instruments get the same spectral signal response with very\n\nsmall relative shifts and the more precise interferometric approach can be taken.\n\nSince SAR systems are coherent systems, the delays can be measured very accu-\n\nrately for each matching pixel from the phase differences between the two\n\n410 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\ninstrument data sets. As already pointed out in Sect. 13.2.5 such interferometric\n\nphase differences are ambiguous and provide only relative range differences, cyclic\n\nin units of the wavelength.\n\n13.8.3 Co-Registration of SAR Images\n\nIn order to correctly exploit the two different viewing geometries for height\n\nmeasurements, their differential effects on the two images have to be\n\ncompensated. Only matching images yield the highest possible coherence\u2014the\n\nminimal phase and height noises\u2014from the inherent signal-to-noise ratio of\n\nthe two SAR data sets. First of all, the images have to be resampled, correcting\n\nfor the relative shifts and co-registered onto a common grid to overlay matching\n\npairs of pixel in the master satellite\u2019s data and the slave\u2019s one which image the\n\nsame ground point. Besides large scale offsets from the different orbits (mostly\n\ncompensated during bistatic focusing), the precise delays are already related to the\n\nlocal topography due to the radargrammetric parallactic shifts. Thus they are\n\nunknown and have to be measured from the data itself. Unlike the relative phases,\n\nthe residual shifts are much more difficult to determine since they are in the order\n\nof fractions of the resolution cell only. The ITP uses coherent cross correlation of\n\nequidistantly sampled patches of 32 ? 32 samples in the two images to derive\nprecise shifts in the order of 1/100th of the resolution (hence in the order of the\n\nwavelength) and interpolates in between. In cases of incoherent data, fallback\n\nsolutions based on incoherent cross correlation and orbit geometry are\n\nimplemented. But not only the spatial mismatch has to be compensated; different\n\nviewing geometries and azimuth beam pointings (\u201cDoppler centroids\u201d) also cause\n\nmutual spectral shifts (in range and azimuth) of the complex data. Spectral\n\ncomponents at the edge of the observed bandwidth visible from one point are\n\nnot present in the other data set. In order not to introduce additional noise\n\n(decrease the coherence), the data have to be spectrally filtered for the matching\n\nspectral parts only.\n\n13.8.4 Bistatic SAR Processing\n\nEven with spatially and spectrally perfectly matching data, the main problem for\n\ninterferometry is that both instruments need a common and stable absolute phase\n\nreference to correctly relate phase differences to distances or heights. In\n\nmonostatic SAR, the own instrument oscillator is such a reference but in bistatic\n\nacquisitions, the transmitted and received signals are (de-)modulated with two\n\ndifferent oscillators; yielding offsets and\u2014worse even\u2014strong variations and\n\ndrifts of the phases with time. As introduced in Sect. 13.2.4, these relative offsets\n\nare measured by exchanging synchronisation pulses and compensated during\n\nprocessing as detailed below. However, the phases of the sync pulses are again\n\n13 TanDEM-X 411\n\n\n\nambiguous by 2p and the derived differential phase offset is ambiguous by p.\nHence the bistatic interferometric height measurements of TanDEM-X are\n\ndetermined for each pixel only within a height of ambiguity range with a global\n\noffset of half this ambiguity. This will be denoted as p-ambiguity in the\nfollowing.\n\nThe prerequisite for interferometric and radargrammetric exploitation of a SAR\n\nimage pair are first accurate signal corrections at raw data level and second highly\n\naccurate focusing with respect to phase and pixel time registration. The most\n\nimportant signal correction is the compensation of the phase and time drifts in the\n\nbistatic channel caused by the two independently drifting oscillators which provide\n\nthe timing references for pixel registration as well as the carrier frequency signals\n\nfor modulation and demodulation. The determination of the compensation function\n\nis based on differential phase and shift measurements of the bi-directionally\n\nexchanged synchronisation pulses. Timing and phase evaluation of both the SAR\n\nsignal and the synchronisation signal, require precise determination of signal\n\npropagation delays taking into account the bi-dynamic geometric constellation of\n\ntransmitter and receiver. The effective geometric distance Dx(t) between the trans-\nmitter, and a given point on ground in case of the SAR echo, and the receiver is\n\ngiven by the recursive formulation\n\nDx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc xRX\u00f0t\u00de ? xTX t? Dx\u00f0t\u00de\nc\n\n? ?????\n???? (13.2)\n\nand is resolved by an iterative computing scheme involving interpolation of the\n\norbit state vectors x(t). The differential phase compensation is applied as a contig-\nuous correction to the bistatic channel SAR raw data. Differential time drift\n\ncompensation is sufficiently corrected by piecewise constant shifts updated per\n\nSAR echo line. The moderate bistatic acquisition geometry of TanDEM-X permits\n\nthe application of the TerraSAR-X chirp scaling focusing algorithm extended by a\n\nbistatic computation of an equivalent monostatic range history. Therefore, the true\n\nbistatic range history R\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1\n2\nRTx\u00f0t? t\u00f0t\u00de\u00de \u00fe RRx\u00f0t\u00de\u00f0 \u00de is numerically computed\n\nfollowing the bi-dynamic formulation of (13.2) and the descriptive parameters ~R0;\n~V2, and ~t0 of the monostatic equivalent range history\n\n~R\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n~R0\n\n2 \u00fe ~V2 ? \u00f0t? ~t0\u00de2\nq\n\n(13.3)\n\nare derived by a function fit. Instead of fitting the range history (13.3) directly, the\n\nsquare of it, i.e. a parabola, is optimized. Once the monostatic equivalent range\n~R\u00f0t\u00de is fitted to the true range R\u00f0t\u00de, not only a more accurate azimuth focusing\nparameter\n\nFM\u00f0R\u00de \u00bc 2 ? ~V2 l ?

Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nis obtained, but also the along-track shift ~t0 and the across shift 2 ? \u00f0RTX ? ~R0\u00de c= ,\nwhich are the radargrammetric reference points in the time domain.\n\n13.8.5 Phase Unwrapping\n\nThe main task of generating accurate DEMs from bistatic interferometric phases is\n\nto assign each of these phase values its absolute phase offset by solving for the\n\nambiguities described above. The first step is to \u201cunwrap\u201d the phases by following\n\nphase gradients on consistent paths within the image and thus counting the ambi-\n\nguity cycles. That is only possible if the phase information is connected for larger\n\nareas within the image without too much phase noise in between and phase slopes\n\nsmaller than p/sample. The ITP uses for that a minimum cost flow algorithm where\na function of the coherence represents the \u201ccosts\u201d of the paths to follow. Pixel-to-\n\npixel jumps in topographic height larger than the ambiguity or areas disconnected\n\nfrom the rest by random phases (e.g. from the incoherent water bodies or shadow/\n\nlayovers) may result in wrongly assigned ambiguity offsets\u2014the phase unwrapping\n\nerrors where segments of the DEM have erroneous offsets of exact multiples of the\n\nheight of ambiguity. These are unavoidable for complicated terrain and/or incoher-\n\nent data if the only available information for unwrapping are the phases of one\n\nsingle bistatic acquisition.\n\n13.8.6 Determination of Absolute Phase Offset\n\nThe second step is to derive the absolute distance to the arbitrary starting point\n\nof the unwrapping process to solve for the global offset. The latter is usually\n\ndone by ingesting external reference information on tie points into processing.\n\nThe ITP however uses the novel approach to derive a coarse radargrammetric\n\nabsolute distance map (actually a DEM which is not geocoded) from the co-\n\nregistration cross-correlation patch measurements for determining the absolute\n\nphase offset of the entire scene. Each individual patch yields only for very\n\ncoherent data a distance resolution below the wavelength. But for assigning an\n\noffset for the entire scene, the difference of the (correctly) unwrapped phase\n\nand all coherent radargrametric estimates is averaged, resulting in sub-\n\nmillimetric offset accuracy [35]. This is more than sufficient for assigning the\n\nright global p-ambiguity band to the interferometric phase if the delays of both\ninstruments are correctly calibrated. Finally the absolute unwrapped interfero-\n\nmetric phases are geocoded into heights onto geographic coordinates using\n\niterative steps with interpolated grids of phase-to-height conversion functions\n\ntaking the spatially varying geometry parameters into account\u2014especially\n\nsensitive to baseline data accuracy. Additionally, any influences of signal\n\npropagation on the pixel localization, phases and heights have to be accounted\n\nfor. Besides the standard correction of the large tropospheric range delay of\n\n13 TanDEM-X 413\n\n\n\n2\u20134 m valid for both instruments and shifting the interferogram only, also a\n\nphase distortion from the very small discrepancy in path length from the\n\nangular separation of the two instruments is observed. It is causing a signal\n\ndelay (and phase) difference in the millimetre range with corresponding height\n\nerrors in the meter range.\n\nIn TanDEM-X, solving for the p-ambiguities in the order of 10\u201330 m, a relative\ninstrument ranging accuracy in the order of millimetres is required. This outstand-\n\ning precision is only possible with highly accurate signal and geometric processing\n\nalgorithms and result of an extensive bistatic system calibration campaign\n\n(cf. Sect. 13.10). In the latter, the two measurements of radargrammetric shifts\n\nand interferometric phases where compared for thousands of scenes in different\n\ninstrument settings to a reference phase derived from SRTM DEMs inside the ITP\n\nand aligned with delay and phase corrections provided for the processor. This had to\n\nbe done in accordance with the simultaneous baseline product calibration which\n\ninfluences both. The self-contained processing approach of the ITP thereby enables\n\nTanDEM-X to act for nearly 90% of the land surface as a very precise and\n\nindependent absolute height measurement instrument and thus allows to derive\n\nchanges in heights (e.g. on glaciers or ice fields) in the meter ranges without being\n\nbiased by outdated reference heights.\n\n13.8.7 Quality Control\n\nThe remaining problem is to determine the correctness of the unwrapped phases for\n\noffset determination and for DEM quality control. Also for this task, the\n\nradargrammetric estimates are used. An iterative filtering allows to locally compare\n\nthe phases and the distances to detect unwrapping errors for areas larger than about\n\n1 km2. Deviating patches are then excluded from the phase offset determination. If\n\nthe image contains a significant amount (about 3%) of discrepant regions, the\n\nresulting DEM is flagged as problematic by the ITP.\n\n13.8.8 Multiple Baseline Phase Unwrapping\n\nThe entire mission concept is designed to achieve a high accuracy from large\n\nbaseline acquisitions while taking into account unwrapping problems from the\n\nvery small height of ambiguities. To mitigate the latter, the dual baseline phase\n\nunwrapping concept has been developed for the processing chain [36, 37]. The\n\nEarth is mapped at least twice with different heights of ambiguity. The ITP\n\nprocesses every large baseline acquisition and every one with unwrapping problems\n\nwith the help of the previously processed acquisitions. The intermediate products\n\nfrom the first processing run are the co-registered complex products (CoSSCs).\n\nOverlapping data sets of new raw data and the old CoSSCs are unwrapped and the\n\ndifferential phase is derived. The differential interferogram has a much larger\n\n414 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nheight of ambiguity than the two single acquisitions (h?1 \u00bc h1?1?h2?1). It is easier\nto unwrap but also noisier. From this interferogram and measured unwrapped phase\n\ndiscrepancies between first and second acquisitions, erroneous regions are\n\nidentified in the unwrapped phases. Since even the differential interferogram may\n\nhave unwrapping errors for problematic scenes, the two radargrammetric estimates\n\nare used to correct the ambiguity band of the differential phases. These modified\n\nphases are then used to correct (only) the ambiguity cycle of the large baseline\n\ninterferogram where necessary. Filtering and region detection algorithms are\n\nimplemented to maintain the full resolution and quality of the interferogram. The\n\nraw DEM derived from this iteratively improved interferogram replaces any erro-\n\nneous single acquisition based raw DEM prior to the mosaicking and calibration\n\nprocess. The major steps of the entire ITP processing workflow are summarized in\n\nFig. 13.19.\n\n13.9 Interferometric and DEM Performance Monitoring\n\nThe excellent radar instrument performance and stability of both satellites is the\n\nbasis for high-quality SAR imaging and has been demonstrated in the monostatic\n\ncommissioning phases of both TSX in 2007 [38, 39] and TDX in 2010 [40].

The interferometric phase information is trans-\n\nlated into elevation values which are characterised by their respective relative\n\nheight accuracies. The instrument settings and satellite formation parameters have\n\nbeen optimised for global DEM acquisition using a dedicated height error simulator\n\nand are now systematically evaluated during the operational mission.\n\nMajor factors which affect the relative height accuracy are the radiometric\n\nsensitivity of each SAR instrument, range and azimuth ambiguities, quantisation\n\nnoise, processing and co-registration errors as well as surface and volume\n\ndecorrelation, scaled by the baseline length [1]. A key quantity in estimating the\n\ninterferometric performance is the coherence which has been computed for\n\nTanDEM-X by the product\n\ngTot \u00bc gSNR ? gQuant ? gAmb ? gCoreg ? gGeo ? gAz ? gVol ? gTemp (13.5)\n\nwhere the right hand side describes the different error contributions due to the\n\nlimited SNR (gSNR), radar signal quantisation (gQuant), ambiguities (gAmb), limited\ncoregistration accuracy (gCoreg), baseline decorrelation (gGeo), relative shift of\nDoppler spectra (gAz), volume decorrelation (gVol), and temporal decorrelation\n(gTemp). Different scattering characteristics as well as changing baseline and instru-\nment configurations influence the coherence. An important contribution is the\n\nlimited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which depends on both the sensitivity of\n\nthe radar instruments and the power of the backscattered signal. For TanDEM-X,\n\nthe two instruments are almost identical and the mean SNR of both interferometric\n\nchannels yields a theoretical coherence [41]\n\ngSNR \u00bc\n1\n\n1\u00fe SNR?1mean\n(13.6)\n\nwhich is plotted as the red line in Fig. 13.20. In the same figure the measured\n\ncoherence of TanDEM-X interferograms is shown. The measurements can be\n\ndivided into four main land classes: boreal forest and soil and rock test sites (blue\n\ntriangles and red diamonds) have on average better performance (gTot > 0.7) than\nareas characterized by tropical or rain forest (green dots). In the latter, coherence\n\nlosses are mainly due to the existence of volume decorrelation over dense forest.\n\nSandy deserts have in addition very low SNR (red squares).\n\nIn vegetated areas, volume scattering is the primary reason for coherence loss.\n\nRain forests with tree heights of over 40 m have been measured in varying\n\nTanDEM-X bistatic acquisition configurations. Typical heights of ambiguity for\n\nthe global DEM acquisition are in the same range. With this knowledge, the\n\nbaseline geometry can be optimised for vegetated areas to achieve heights of\n\nambiguity greater than the forest heights. Figure 13.21 is an example where the\n\ncoherence improvement is particularly visible over Amazon rain forest (lower part\n\nof the images), whereas in the clear-cuts almost the same high coherence is\n\nobtained.\n\n416 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nThe bistatic image coherence is directly correlated with the relative height\n\naccuracy Dh of the corresponding DEM, where high coherence values translate\ninto a low interferometric phase error D\u2019 and vice versa:\n\nDh \u00bc hamb ? \u00f0Df=2p\u00de (13.7)\n\nThe height error of TanDEM-X elevation data has been determined from the\n\ndifference between two repeated DEM data takes over the same ground area\n\nacquired using the same configuration parameters. Two sources of errors mainly\n\ncontribute to the difference and can be characterized in the frequency domain: low\n\nfrequency errors and systematic offsets such as orbit errors and height shifts can\n\nbe filtered out; and high frequency errors, characterizing the random error in\n\nrelative vertical height, due to coherence losses and phase unwrapping problems.\n\nThe relative vertical height error is derived from the 90% distribution interval of\n\nthe high-frequency errors.1 Figure 13.22 presents the results obtained from the\n\nanalysis of several test sites, acquired with different geometries and classified as\n\nsoil and rock terrain. Even if the final DEM will be obtained by the combination of\n\nat least two global acquisitions, for some test sites one acquisition is already\n\nsufficient to meet the required specification. A linear fit through the height error\n\nestimates shows a good qualitative agreement with the DEM performance\n\npredictions from Fig. 13.6: a 90% point-to-point height error of approx. 1.7 and\n\nFig. 13.20 Interferometric coherence of land area over signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Single values indicate the coherence of\n\nTanDEM-X interferograms\n\n1 Since the relative vertical height accuracy depends on the terrain slope, a proper mask has to be\n\napplied, in order to discriminate flat and mountainous terrain.\n\n13 TanDEM-X 417\n\n\n\n2.5 m is predicted for a height of ambiguity of 30 and 45 m, respectively (yellow\n\nbars in Fig. 13.22).\n\nFigure 13.23 presents a global map of coherence for all processed DEM data\n\ntakes between December 2010 and December 2011. The total coherence is derived\n\nby averaging over land surfaces only. Over 90% of the processed interferograms are\n\ncharacterized by a mean coherence higher than 0.6, which typically assures a\n\nsufficient quality of the final DEM. Areas suffering from low interferometric\n\nperformance are identified by low coherence and phase unwrapping problems in\n\nthe processing. Difficult terrain\u2014mainly forested or mountainous regions\u2014will be\n\nre-acquired in dedicated campaigns with larger heights of ambiguity and other\n\nviewing angles.\n\n13.10 Bistatic and Interferometric System Calibration\n\n13.10.1 Expected Height Error\n\nThe height accuracy of an InSAR DEM is affected by different error mechanisms\n\nthat can be classified in noise-like degradation and more systematic contributions.\n\nPerformance losses due to volume, temporal or SNR decorrelation (Sect. 13.9)\n\ncause noise-like height errors that can only be partly mitigated by spectral\n\nFig. 13.21 Coherence of Amazon rain forest test site acquired at different acquisition geometries.\n\nLow coherence is visualized as dark colour.

Other SAR geometry dependent\n\nprocessing effects, like phase unwrapping errors, shadow or layover, can be\n\neffectively reduced by appropriately combining several DEMs acquired with\n\ndifferent viewing geometries [1, 42]. The TanDEM-X error budget assumes a\n\nheight error (90% confidence level) of 1.8 m for the noise-like contributions\n\nFig. 13.22 Summary of the relative height error (HE) performance for data takes over soil & rock\n\nsurfaces.

High coherence is coloured in green, medium coherence in yellow and low\ncoherence in red and purple. Grey areas were acquired but still in the processing queue during the\ntime that this coherence map was generated\n\n13 TanDEM-X 419\n\n\n\nremaining after the averaging process. On the other side, there are the systematic,\n\nbut nondeterministic errors. Before launch, a detailed survey on the different\n\ncomponents of the TanDEM-X system was carried out. Two dominant systematic\n\nerror sources were identified: inaccuracies in the baseline determination and\n\ndrifts in the SAR instrument. The baseline determination error is driven by the\n\nresidual errors of the relative GPS position determination between both satellites\n\nand the determination accuracy of the locations of the SAR antenna phase centres\n\nby way of the attitude information provided by the star sensors. The SAR\n\ninstrument is mainly affected by temperature drifts due to the warming of the\n\ntransmit/receive modules over an acquisition and by initial offsets due to slight\n\ndifferences in the interferometic behaviour of the two (independent) satellites.\n\nThese sources cause additional height errors that are expected to reach several\n\nmeters, which would exceed the relative height error requirement of 2 m (90%\n\nconfidence level). To quantify the error magnitudes, the influence of the sources\n\nwas estimated and fed into a simulation tool. With the simulation results, a\n\npolynomial error model was established in order to estimate the DEM height\n\nerror g over a data take\n\ngn\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc an \u00fe bnx\u00fe cny\u00fe dnxy\u00fe eny2 \u00fe fny3 (13.8)\n\nwhere an. . .fn are the unknown parameters, x are the coordinates of image points in\nground range and y in azimuth direction and n is the index of data take. The first\nterm a describes a constant offset of the DEM, b is a tilt in range, c, e and f stand\nfor ramps and gradients in azimuth and d describes a torsion over range and\nazimuth.\n\nTo minimize these height errors, the DEM calibration effort is focused on the\n\ninitial reduction of the baseline error by means of the baseline calibration\n\n[43] (cf. Sects. 13.7 and 13.10.2), the reduction of systematic phase errors and the\n\nestimation of the polynomial coefficients in the DEM calibration procedure\n\n[44] (cf. Sect. 13.11). These corrections, which use globally distributed test sites\n\nand height references [45] and the information of adjacent acquisitions, shall ensure\n\nthe 2 m relative height accuracy of the final TanDEM-X DEM product (see\n\nFig. 13.24).\n\n13.10.2 Baseline Calibration\n\nThe baseline is determined from GPS data provided by dual frequency IGOR GPS\n\nreceivers on both satellites followed by a double-differential processing approach\n\n(cf. Sect. 13.7). Relative accuracies are within the 1 mm (1s) requirement, but\noffsets of a few millimetres may not be excluded from this approach. By monitoring\n\nthe average height error in DEMs over dedicated global test sites, the potential\n\nbaseline bias perpendicular to flight direction can be characterized [43]. This\n\n420 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nprocedure has been successfully applied during the TanDEM-X pursuit monostatic\n\ncommissioning phase, achieving a correction accuracy of around 2 mm (1s) (see\nFig. 13.25). The 2 mm variability around the mean value includes besides the\n\nresidual baseline errors several other error contributions from the SAR instrument\n\nand the limited accuracy of the reference heights, which are considered in the\n\noverall DEM error budget.\n\n13.10.3 Calibration of Instrument and External Delays\n\nThe interferometrically derived DEMs are initially ambiguous by the height of\n\nambiguity. To correctly resolve this ambiguity, radargrammetry is used which\n\nestimates the absolute location and height of large patches in the acquisition\n\n(Sect. 13.8). The estimation is based on the travel times of the radar signals.\n\nHence, the technique is very sensitive to differential instrument delays. Such\n\ndifferential delays are caused by different receiver gain settings, different\n\nFig. 13.24 Example of the\n\nheight error histograms of a\n\nTanDEM-X DEM in\n\nconsecutive calibration stages\n\n(ICESat heights are used as\n\nreferences)\n\nFig. 13.25 Baseline offsets\n\nestimated during the\n\nmonostatic commissioning\n\nphase\n\n13 TanDEM-X 421\n\n\n\nbandwidths, different synchronisation horn combinations, or are dependent on the\n\ntransmitting satellite [43]. The dependencies were derived by statistical evaluations\n\nand dedicated analyses of the acquired DEM data. Moreover, also relativistic and\n\ndifferential tropospheric effects have been observed to cause systematic shifts of\n\nseveral meters in the DEMs [46]. All these contributions are compensated during\n\nthe interferometric processing. To resolve the p-ambiguity, the measured\nradargrammetric shifts shall be lower than the target interval of ?7.5 mm (around\n?l/4), as shown Fig. 13.26 for 99% of the acquired scenes.\n\n13.10.4 DEM Stability in the Running Mission\n\nAfter applying the corrections mentioned in the previous section, about 90% of the\n\nDEMs show absolute height errors better than ?10 m (Fig. 13.27) [47]. Most\noutliers are caused by the p-ambiguity (Sect. 13.8) and will be corrected by\nreprocessing. During the final DEM calibration process (Sect. 13.11), the DEM\n\nacquisitions are calibrated relative to each other and against globally distributed\n\nICESat reference points.\n\n13.11 DEM Calibration and Mosaicking\n\nIn this section the last two steps of the DEM processing, namely DEM calibration\n\nand DEM mosaicking are outlined. The DEM calibration estimates for each data\n\ntake its offset, tilt in range and slope in the azimuth direction. In a weighted least-\n\nsquares block adjustment several neighbouring data takes (up to continental scale)\n\nare simultaneously calibrated. This approach guarantees smooth height transitions\n\nat data take borders. The DEM mosaicking merges different, corrected DEM\n\nFig. 13.26 Estimated radargrammetric shifts of the TanDEM-X DEMs with respect to the ones\n\nderived with the help of SRTM, after applying the correction parameters.

Krieger et al.\n\n\n\nacquisitions and tiles the resulting DEM mosaic and additional product layers (e.g.\n\namplitude mosaic and height error mask) into one-by-one degree geocells.\n\n13.11.1 DEM Calibration Approach\n\nThe DEM calibration is part of the operationally implemented \u201cDEM Mosaicking\n\nand Calibration Processor\u201d within the ground segment (Fig. 13.28) [48]. In a first\n\ndata-driven processing step (DEM preparation) the DEM scenes generated by the\n\nITP (Sect. 13.8) are successively processed and some measures for height\n\ndiscrepancies, a water body detection mask, and a list of calibration (tie) points\n\nare produced. After interactive quality control the results of the DEM preparation\n\nprocessor are stored in the archive system (PL).\n\nFor TanDEM-X, ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) data are used\n\nas height references (ground control points\u2014GCPs). The ICESat spaceborne laser\n\naltimeter data provide a very good global coverage for referencing the DEM with\n\na foot print distance of 170 m in along-track and a maximum ground-track\n\nseparation of 80 km at the equator [49]. According to an accuracy study [50]\n\nthe standard deviation for selected ICESat points in flat bare surfaces is below\n\n2 m. Therefore, several selection criteria are considered, like number and width of\n\npeaks in the waveforms (indicator for vegetation) as well as received signal\n\nlevels. In order to combine ICESat points and the corresponding TanDEM-X\n\npixels, all elevation values within the ICESat footprint are averaged. Furthermore,\n\nequidistant tie-points in the at least 3 km wide overlap between neighbouring\n\nDEMs are used as input for the DEM calibration (Fig. 13.29). At tie-points image\n\nchips in the dimension of about one by one kilometre are extracted from the raw\n\nDEM, the amplitude and the Height Error Mask (HEM). Inside the chips unsuit-\n\nable areas are excluded with the help of previously generated height discrepancy\n\nFig. 13.27 Absolute height difference between the TanDEM-X DEMs and SRTM (and other\n\nreferences) after baseline calibration in bistatic operation.

From the remaining \u2018valid\u2019\n\npixels the median height value is assigned to the tie-point instead of the mean,\n\nreducing the impact of outliers. Over the whole mission approx. 40 Mio. chips\n\ncorresponding to 12 TB will be extracted globally. All calibration points are\n\nstored in lists to be used as observations during the DEM calibration. In that way,\n\nit is possible to calibrate larger regions without reading huge image data volumes\n\nfrom the archive.\n\nDEM calibration is performed on blocks of larger connected DEM data takes.\n\nThe polynomial correction parameters (an\u2013fn) of (13.8) will be estimated for each\ndata take within the DEM Calibration Processor by means of a least-squares\n\nadjustment [51, 52]. The approach assumes that after application of the error\n\nfunction the heights in overlapping areas should be identical, apart from random\n\nnoise. The advantage of this method is that the correction parameters can be found\n\nindependent from terrain types. The observables are averaged heights at each tie-\n\npoint or GCP. For all observations accuracies resp. weights are set up for the\n\nstochastic model. The unknown parameters are estimated iteratively by a\n\nweighted least-squares adjustment [53]. Those correction parameters that could\n\nnot significantly be estimated are excluded from further iterations. As result we\n\nalso get quality parameters from the adjustment. The DEM calibration is initiated\n\nby an operator who also monitors the progress using a Visualization and\n\nOperating tool (MCP-Vis-OT, see top left of Fig. 13.28). As the DEMs are\n\nacquired and processed according to the globally oriented data acquisition plan\n\n(Sect. 13.5) the DEM calibration of larger blocks starts after finishing the first\n\nglobal acquisition.\n\n13.11.2 Mosaicking\u2014Weighted Combination of DEMs\n\nPurpose of the DEM Mosaicking Processor is the fusion of all DEM information\n\nlayers [54]: DEMs, height error maps, and amplitude data as well as the generation\n\nof a fused water indication mask. The calibrated corrections are applied to each\n\nDEM and different coverages will be mosaicked by a weighted average of the\n\nelevation values [1]\n\nh \u00bc\nPK\nk\u00bc1\n\n1\ns2\nHEM;k\n\nhk\n\nPK\nk\u00bc1\n\n1\ns2\nHEM;k\n\n(13.9)\n\nwith sHEM as the height error of one elevation. In case of increased HEM values, a\nspecial border handling is applied. Amplitude and HEM values are also fused with\n\nthe help of the height error map. After the DEMmosaicking processor an interactive\n\nquality control is performed on the resulting geocells. A by-product is the so-called\n\n13 TanDEM-X 425\n\n\n\nWater Indication Mask (WAM). The intention of this WAM is not to map a global\n\nwater mask, but to have a supplementary information layer to support the DEM\n\nediting process. As the TanDEM-X DEM is an unedited, interferometric product,\n\nwater surfaces will appear noisy because of low coherence and/or backscatter.\n\nThe DEM calibration and mosaicking approach was applied to early\n\ncommissioning phase data takes of a test site in Minnesota (USA). The mosaick\n\n(see Fig. 13.30) is compared to SRTM and shows a mean offset of 2 m to SRTM, but\n\njust 3 cm offset to ICESat verification points. One can clearly note the stripe pattern\n\nfrom SRTM that is not present in the TanDEM-X DEM. Figure 13.31 shows a\n\nmosaicked DEM of Iceland that has been derived from the TanDEM-X data takes of\n\nthe first acquisition year.\n\n13.12 Scientific Exploitation and Experimental Results\n\nBeyond its primary goal of acquiring a global DEM, TanDEM-X provides the\n\nremote sensing scientific community with a unique data set to demonstrate new\n\nbistatic and multistatic radar techniques for enhanced bio- and geophysical param-\n\neter retrieval. The following subsections summarize some of the advanced\n\ncapabilities of TanDEM-X which can be operated in a multitude of modes and\n\nconfigurations [1]. First exciting results, which were obtained during the TanDEM-\n\nX commissioning phase, already demonstrate the great potential of bistatic and\n\nmultistatic SAR to serve novel and extremely powerful remote sensing applications\n\n[55\u201357]. The intention of this section is to provide only a succinct overview of the\n\nwide range of possible applications. A complete description of the experiments and\n\na detailed discussion of their results can be found in the provided references. Many\n\nof the experiments may form the basis for future formation flying SAR missions.\n\nFig. 13.30 Left: TanDEM-X DEM of geocell W97 N47 of Minnesota test site, right: difference to\nSRTM after DEM calibration and mosaicking of three data takes. The colourbar on the right refers\nto the height difference between SRTM and TanDEM-X\n\n426 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\n13.12.1 Velocity Measurements from Space\n\nTanDEM-X has the capability to provide highly accurate velocity measurements of\n\nmoving objects within a large coverage area. This can be achieved by comparing\n\nthe amplitude and phase of two SAR images acquired at slightly different times\n\n(Fig. 13.32). By adjusting the along-track displacement between the TDX and TSX\n\nsatellites from almost zero to several tens of kilometres, TanDEM-X can adapt its\n\nsensitivity to a broad spectrum of velocities ranging from less than a millimetre per\n\nsecond to more than hundred kilometres per hour. The Helix satellite formation\n\nemployed by TanDEM-X enables even a minimization of the effective cross-track\n\nbaseline for a given latitude and incident angle, thereby reducing the complexity in\n\nthe velocity estimation process. Along-track interferometry can furthermore be\n\nenhanced by the so-called dual receive antenna mode (cf. Sect. 13.3) in each of\n\nthe two tandem satellites, which provides additional phase centres separated by a\n\nshort along-track baseline of 2.4 m. The combination of short and long baseline\n\nSAR data acquisitions improves both the detection and localization of moving\n\nobjects and resolves phase ambiguities in case of fast moving scatterers.\n\nTanDEM-X provides hence a unique SAR system with four phase centres separated\n\nin the along-track direction. Potential applications are Ground Moving Target\n\nIndication (GMTI), the measurement of ocean currents, as well as the monitoring\n\nof sea ice drift and rotation.\n\nFigure 13.33 shows as a first example the observation of ship movements in the\n\nStrait of Gibraltar [56]. The data were acquired during themonostatic commissioning\n\nphase where the satellites had an along-track separation of 20 km. This separation\n\ncorresponds to a time lag of 2.6 s. The 2-D velocity vector could be measured with an\n\nFig. 13.31 Mosaick of Iceland DEM acquired by TanDEM-X\n\n13 TanDEM-X 427\n\n\n\nFig. 13.32 Velocity measurements with TanDEM-X. The Helix satellite formation allows\n\na flexible adjustment of the desired along-track separation between the satellites. In addition, a\n\nshort along-track baseline is provided by each satellite via the split antenna\n\nFig. 13.33 Ship movements observed with TanDEM-X during the monostatic commissioning\n\nphase. The ship displacements can be seen from the insets showing TSX and TDX image patches\n\noverlaid in different colours.

The velocity measurements have been validated with\n\nindependent data obtained from the Automatic Identification System (AIS).\n\n13.12.2 Large Baseline Cross-Track Interferometry\n\nLarge baseline interferometry takes advantage of the high bandwidth of the TSX\n\nand TDX radar instruments, allowing for coherent data acquisitions with cross-\n\ntrack baselines of up to 5 km and more. Note that less than 5% of the maximum\n\npossible (critical) baseline length is used during nominal DEM data acquisition.\n\nLarge baseline interferograms can hence significantly improve the height accuracy\n\nbeyond the standard TanDEM-X DEM quality, but the associated low height of\n\nambiguity requires typically a combination of multiple interferograms with differ-\n\nent baseline lengths to resolve phase ambiguities, especially in hilly and mountain-\n\nous terrain. Further opportunities arise from a comparison of multiple large baseline\n\nTanDEM-X interferograms acquired during different passes of the satellite forma-\n\ntion (Fig. 13.34). This provides a sensitive measure for vertical scene and structure\n\nchanges. Potential applications are a detection of the grounding line which\n\nseparates the shelf from the inland ice in polar regions, monitoring of vegetation\n\ngrowth (e.g. agricultural fields), mapping of atmospheric water vapour with high\n\nspatial resolution, measurement of snow accumulation or the detection of anthro-\n\npogenic changes of the environment, e.g. due to deforestation. Note that most of\n\nthese combinations rely on a comparison of two or more single-pass (large baseline)\n\nFig. 13.34 Performance example for large baseline DEM acquisitions with TanDEM-X (cross-\n\ntrack baseline \u00bc 3,000 m, posting \u00bc 12 m). A relative height accuracy (single point standard\ndeviation) better than 10 cm is predicted\n\n13 TanDEM-X 429\n\n\n\ncross-track interferograms and do hence not necessarily require coherence between\n\nthe different passes. Further information can be gained from an evaluation of\n\ncoherence changes, potentially augmented by polarimetric information. This is\n\nfor instance well suited to reveal even slight changes in the soil and vegetation\n\nstructure reflecting vegetation growth and loss, freezing and thawing, fire destruc-\n\ntion, human activities, and so on. The combination of repeated TanDEM-X\n\nsingle-pass interferograms enables hence the entry into a new era of interferometric\n\nand tomographic 3-D and 4-D SAR imaging as it was ERS-1/2 for the development\n\nof classical repeat-pass SAR interferometry.\n\nFigure 13.35 shows as a first example a large baseline DEM which was acquired\n\nby TanDEM-X on July 16, 2010 in the Russian Arctic (October Revolution Island)\n\n[57]. The DEMwas part of a longer data take that used a sophisticated commanding\n\nto obtain a large baseline interferogram while TDX was still drifting towards TSX\n\nfrom its initial along-track separation of 15,700 km (Sect. 13.6). At the time of data\n\nacquisition, the two satellites were 380 km apart from each other, resulting in a\n\ntemporal separation of 50 s. Earth rotation caused a cross-track baseline of 2 km\n\nwhich corresponds to a height of ambiguity of only 3.8 m. A squinted operation was\n\nnecessary to provide a sufficient overlap of the Doppler spectra. The right hand side\n\nof Fig. 13.35 shows the predicted (black curve) and estimated (gray curve) standard\n\ndeviation of the point-to-point relative height error for a linear slice through the\n\nDEM. The predicted error was calculated from the coherence measurements and the\n\nestimated error was obtained by high-pass filtering the DEM slice [57]. Both results\n\nshow that the relative height accuracy is in the order of 20 cm. This demonstrates\n\nthe great potential of formation flying SAR missions to obtain high resolution\n\nelevation information with decimetre accuracy, thereby enabling new remote\n\nsensing applications. An example is the monitoring of height changes over glaciers,\n\nice caps or ice sheets to quantify their ice mass balance and a dedicated formation\n\nflying SAR mission has already been proposed for this purpose [58].\n\nFig. 13.35 Large baseline TanDEM-X DEM of the edge of October Revolution island (left) and\npredicted (blue) versus estimated (green) point-to-point height accuracy along a DEM slice\n(cf. [57] for details)\n\n430 G. Krieger et al.\n\n\n\n13.12.3 Polarimetric SAR Interferometry\n\nPolarimetric SAR interferometry combines interferometric with polarimetric\n\nmeasurements to gain 3-D structure information from semi-transparent volume\n\nscatterers in a single pass [59, 60]. A prominent example is the measurement of\n\nvegetation height and density which forms also the basis of future formation flying\n\nSAR missions dedicated to global environmental monitoring. Figure 13.36 shows\n\nas an example the interferometric height differences obtained for a dual-polarized\n\nTanDEM-X spotlight acquisition of an agricultural field in Russia. The height\n\ndifference is a result of a different path length of the polarization depending on\n\nthe volume structure. The data were acquired during the monostatic commissioning\n\nphase with a perpendicular baseline of 275 m, demonstrating the potential of crop\n\nheight estimation.\n\nNot only agricultural vegetation structure but also very sparse forest like in\n\nboreal regions can be potentially inverted to forest height. Figure 13.37 shows an\n\nexample of an inversion of forest height. The RMSE is around 2 m when compared\n\nto Lidar (H100) measurements. The forest height inversion has been obtained from\n\ndata acquired in the pursuit monostatic mode using dual polarimetric observations\n\n[61]. Future experiments will also employ fully polarimetric acquisitions.\n\n13.13 Conclusions\n\nTanDEM-X is a first demonstration of a \u201cDistributed Space Mission for Earth\n\nSystem Monitoring\u201d. Key technologies like close formation flying, bistatic SAR\n\noperation and synchronisation, precise baseline determination and calibration, as\n\nwell as highly complex processing chains have been implemented. Sophisticated\n\nFig. 13.36 Polarimetric SAR interferometry with TanDEM-X. Left: amplitude of SAR image.\nRight: interferometric height difference between HH and VV channels\n\n13 TanDEM-X 431\n\n\n\nsafety mechanisms allow for safe operation at typical distances between 150 and\n\n1,000 m. The complete system is fully operational since December 2010. Both\n\nsatellites and the ground segment perform remarkably well. Current fuel consump-\n\ntion and battery degradation on the TerraSAR-X satellite is well below specification\n\nand allows predicting life time extensions of 2\u20133 years, i.e. close formation flying\n\nuntil 2015 seems feasible.\n\nThe TanDEM-X system is used to generate a global DEM of unprecedented\n\naccuracy. Achieving such a quality level requires at least two global acquisitions at\n\nincreasing baseline distance. Remaining gaps over difficult terrain will be closed by\n\nadjusting the formation. In total, the acquisition for the global DEM is expected to\n\nbe completed by mid 2013. In parallel to the global DEM acquisition scientific\n\nexperiments are being served if the DEM-optimised formation geometry is ade-\n\nquate. After the global DEM phase the flexibility of the Helix formation will be\n\nfully exploited to allow demonstrating promising future SAR techniques like\n\nalong-track interferometry, ground moving target identification and digital\n\nbeamforming from space. Larger cross-track baselines will also enable the genera-\n\ntion of regional DEMs with improved height accuracy. These unique\n\ndemonstrations and experiments will also provide important information for the\n\ndevelopment and design of future formation flying SAR missions [62].\n\nAcknowledgment The authors represent a large team that was involved in the development of\n\nTanDEM-X.

Its main product: the interferogram, is a map of the difference of the phases\n\nof two radar images acquired on the same site with a time elapsed between the\n\ntakes that can range from zero to several years. The phase maps are ambiguous, like\n\ncontour lines that would not carry any number. They need to be \u201cunwrapped\u201d (i.e.\n\nassigned a number) which is generally done by continuity. Several SAR system\n\nconcepts have been dedicated to interferometry. The Cartwheel concept aims at\n\nmaximizing the interferometric return of a conventional satellite by adding a cheap\n\nconstellation of receive-only micro-satellites in a special, and very efficient, orbital\n\nconfiguration, which disturbs the least, or not at all, the Transmitter. Here we\n\ndescribe the system from its design to some specificities of the processing of the\n\nproducts, some of them offering unique new capabilities. Finally, we suggest some\n\nmore advanced uses of the design.\n\n14.1 Rationale\n\nInterferometric techniques were very successful as soon as space borne radar data\n\nbecame available [1\u20133]. At that time, these radar systems had not been specifically\n\ndesigned for it and it was quite natural to think of optimizing systems for\n\ninterferometry.\n\nRepeat pass interferometry demands a strict repetition of the orbital path,\n\ntypically to within 1 km, and a repetition of the mean D\u20acoppler to a small fraction\nof the antenna pattern or its equivalent in the frequency domain. These conditions\n\nwere met by the standard orbital and attitude correction laws applied to the radar\n\nsatellites so that the only improvement would be to have appropriate orbital cycles\n\nD.

The interferometric products then record\n\nparallax form the topography, proportional to the orbital separation, changes in the\n\natmosphere radio electric depth, attached to a given time of observation, and\n\ndisplacements of the terrain occurring in the time elapsed between the recording\n\nof the interferometric pair of images. In addition, the uncertainty of the orbital\n\nparameters could create \u201corbital fringes\u201d that can easily be removed by a simple\n\npost-processing.\n\nFor topographic applications, the best is to remove as completely as possible the\n\ncontributions changing with time: simultaneous interferometry is the solution.\n\nThe SRTM mission [4] implemented two radar antennae separated by a 60-m\n\nlong mast. Despite its success in global topography, the mission was costly, limited\n\nin duration due to Space Shuttle constraints, and the products difficult to process\n\ndue to mast movement artefacts. One can think of using two identical satellites in\n\nclose formation but, given the cost of a complete satellite, it could be preferable to\n\nlaunch the second later (to increase mission duration) or to launch it in another local\n\nhour (to increase the revisit capabilities of the mission). Besides, they are the risk of\n\ncollision and EM pollution with costly assets. Finally, the relative position of two\n\nfree flying satellites is appropriate only on parts of the orbit and the time delay,\n\nwhile small, is not zero if both satellites are active. They could even cause ground\n\nstation bottleneck if both send telemetry at the same time.\n\nA cheaper solution is to use a second, passive satellite. It could be almost\n\nidentical (having just its transmitter shut down) which has the same drawbacks\n\nbut the EM pollution and potential time delay artefacts. It could also be radically\n\nsimplified: but the simplification is likely to adopt an antenna much smaller than the\n\none of the Transmitter, especially in azimuth, otherwise the receiver would be as\n\nbulky and difficult to launch as the Transmitter, and its cost might follow.\n\nIf now the receiver features a smaller antenna, we face the difficulty of having to\n\ncombine two radar images with different parameters, in particular a much higher\n\nazimuth ambiguity ratio on the receiver\u2019s side. It is a rule of thumb in interferome-\n\ntry that it is better to combine two equally \u201cbad\u201d images than a \u201cgood\u201d and a \u201cbad\u201d\n\nimage. In addition we still have the risk of collision: this time between a high cost\n\nactive satellite and a cheap bug flying around. The constraints of the relative\n\npositions of two satellites also remain.\n\nThe novelty of the Cartwheel [5] is to have several passive satellites and to\n\ncombine only their images. This introduces a radical change in the problem. The\n\nmain satellite (which we will call the Transmitter) is used only as an illuminator. It\n\ncan fly far ahead or behind the set of receivers and the collision risk is removed,\n\nat least with the Transmitter. Interferometry is done with lower grade images, but\n\nsharing identical features. The set of receivers can be disconnected from the\n\ntransmitter in terms of project. It can be launched later when we are sure\n\nthe Transmitter works reliably. The relation between the Transmitter and the\n\nreceivers can be very loose: it suffices that the receivers are informed of\n\nthe Transmitter\u2019s program in advance is order to known where to aim their\n\nantennae. To the extreme, the Transmitter might not be aware of the existence of\n\nthe receivers which, by the way, are very discrete. They could still operate if the\n\n438 D. Massonnet\n\n\n\nTransmitter is jammed by an ill-intentioned ground signal. If we accept the princi-\n\nple of a \u201cfreely designed\u201d, reflector based antenna, the receiver can be generic to a\n\nhigh degree: one can imagine changing a few sub-system to adapt from C-band to\n\nL-band from a generic design that makes up more than 90% of the cost.\n\n14.2 Orbital Configuration\n\nOnce we accept the fact that the interferometric products will be obtained from\n\ncomparison between the records of the passive companions, we must choose their\n\norbital configuration. Working with only two receivers reduces the operational\n\nvalue of the concept. The two receivers will keep changing their relative baseline\n\n(both horizontally and vertically) so that a global topography mission would have to\n\noperate by processing latitudes bands that should be changed during the mission.\n\nTherefore we propose using at least three receivers (remember they are built to be\n\ncheap) in the following way. We assume that the receivers start at the same position\n\nas the Transmitter. Giving an impulse to one of them along the track will give it a\n\nhigher apogee half an orbit later. A second impulse can then recover the initial\n\nsemi-major axis of the Transmitter orbit. In these conditions, the receiver is still\n\nsynchronous with the Transmitter (same orbital period), but seems to describe a\n\nvertical ellipse centred on the Transmitter, with a horizontal axis twice the vertical\n\naxis. This ellipse is described during an orbital period with a constant angular\n\nvelocity as seen from the Transmitter. We can do the same with the two remaining\n\nreceivers, but after one third (resp. two third) orbital period delay. If the ellipse were\n\na circle, then the three receivers would draw an equilateral triangle in it. Finally,\n\nrather than starting from the Transmitter\u2019s position, we start a few tens of\n\nkilometres ahead of behind it. Figure 14.1 gives an idea of the configuration.\n\nFigure 14.2 gives a sketch of the orbital configuration where the summits of one\n\nof the triangle are the receivers. Figure 14.2 can be drawn first as a circle with an\n\nequilateral triangle inside it, then be extended by a factor of two in the horizontal\n\ndirection. Figure 14.2 sketches the two extreme vertical baselines (thicker line)\n\ncorresponding to the height of the triangle aligned vertically or the side of the\n\ntriangle aligned horizontally. If r is the vertical half axis of the ellipse, the two\nvertical baselines are respectively 1.5r and r?3. It is striking to observe that these\nvalues never differ by more than ?7.5% from the value of their geometric average.\nWe created a virtual mast with no displacements other than the smooth and small\n\nchanges easily predicted by orbital mechanics!\n\nThe orbital configuration does not cost much. A 1 km vertical half axis requires\n\n0.5 m/s of total impulse. The configuration can therefore be changed or undone\n\nseveral times during the mission.\n\nMany alternate orbital configurations have been proposed to create adequate\n\nstable baselines. Some propose a slight change of inclination (creating a \u201cflat\u201d\n\nellipse), sometimes combined with eccentricity (producing a slanted ellipse). It\n\nseems that, unlike eccentricity, any change of inclination requires some fuel for\n\n14 Cartwheel 439\n\n\n\ncorrection, in addition to the fuel needed for compensating atmospheric drag. The\n\n\u201cvertical\u201d ellipse of the Cartwheel seems to be the only fully stable one without\n\nsystematic drift.\n\nDetailed studies show that the perigee of any given satellite will not remain at the\n\nsame place as time goes. There is a slow secular motion that rotates the Cartwheel\n\nand creates typically one additional rotation every 4 months.\n\nFinally, if we consider that the set of three satellites \u201crolls\u201d on the orbital path, it\n\nseems to roll counter clockwise as the lower satellite runs faster than the centre of\n\nthe constellation. This feature reminded me the cartwheels used by the pioneers in\n\ntraditional western movies, where stroboscopic effects often created this counter\n\nclockwise appearance, hence the name of the design.\n\nFig. 14.2 Cartwheel basic geometry\n\nFig. 14.1 Artist\u2019s impression of the Cartwheel configuration\n\n440 D. Massonnet\n\n\n\n14.3 Specificity of Processing\n\nThe products of the Cartwheel have specific features. First the time of pulse\n\nemission by the Transmitter is not known, nor, in theory, its range sampling rate.\n\nSecond the level of azimuth ambiguity is larger than in the Transmitter\u2019s image, due\n\nto the generally smaller azimuth size of the antenna. Third the power of the signal is\n\nsmaller due to a generally smaller antenna size. Finally, if we consider that the\n\nCartwheel cruises at safe distance from the Transmitter (typically 100 km),\n\nthe mean D\u20acoppler of the receiver\u2019s images will be large.\nThe two last points do not pose serious problems as linear range migrations can\n\nbe compensated for in the initial step of radar processing at no computing nor\n\nmemory cost. The signal power might be a problem especially if super resolution is\n\nsought. However the global antenna surface of the constellation may remain higher\n\nthan the one of the Transmitter. Preliminary industrial studies of the concepts\n\nfeatured circular reflector antennae with 2.5 m diameter, which totals almost\n\n15 m2, equal or larger than the antennae of ERS1 or RADARSAT.\n\nThe synchronicity with the Transmitter must be addressed. Each local oscillator\n\nwithin the Transmitter or any receiver is a clockwith its own specific features, that is a\n\nbasic frequency and a drift. The problem exists to some extent with other systems\n\nsuch as ERS1-2 tandem data. However, the difference can be larger here. In addition,\n\nthe start time of the pulse emission is not known to the receiver, nor the pulse\n\nrepetition frequency if the Transmitter did not provide it. In the basic Cartwheel\n\ndesign, there is a continuous recording which include the pulse of the Transmitter. Of\n\ncourse the receiver and the Transmitter do not aim at each other, but the direct pulse is\n\nvery strong and will be recorded despite the poor diagram budget. If necessary, an\n\nadditional feeder can be added in the direction of the Transmitter. Since each receiver\n\nrecords the Transmitter\u2019s pulse and since their relative positions are very well known,\n\na perfect reconstruction of the signal is possible. Data compression can be\n\nimplemented to avoid recording blank periods in the continuous recording (i.e. no\n\npulse, no signal). Also keeping a record of all pulses is not required.\n\nThe high level expected from azimuth ambiguities is a potential problem for\n\nimage quality. Let us assume that the Transmitter protects against azimuth ambi-\n\nguity by its large antenna combined with its illumination law by, say, 24 dB. Then\n\nthe small antenna of the receiver might offer no protection on the way back,\n\nreducing the protection to 12 dB. Nothing can be done to kill the ambiguous\n\n\u201cenergy\u201d which will be poured in the receiver\u2019s image. However, we shall explain\n\nwhy ambiguities are not likely to contribute to any coherent combination. Therefore\n\nthe interferometric products will not be affected by their higher level. The reason\n\nlies with the migration phenomenon, a well known parameter in SAR processing\n\n[6]. \u201cParabolic\u201d migrations and \u201clinear\u201d migrations have to be corrected during the\n\nprocessing in order to align the contributions of the given target on a single azimuth\n\nline at a given range for further processing. An azimuth ambiguous contribution\n\nbehaves in a similar way as a nominal target except in the linear part of the\n\nmigrations. As a consequence the ambiguous contribution will be spread on several\n\n14 Cartwheel 441\n\n\n\nrange gates after the migrations have been corrected for nominal contributions. It is\n\neasy to understand that the range resolution of the ambiguous target will be\n\ndegraded because of this spreading which blurs it in range. However, since the\n\ncontribution crosses several range gates during azimuth processing, it never sees\n\nthe full azimuth bandwidth in a single range cell, but only a part of the \u201cazimuth\n\nphase history\u201d. Much like what is done for multi-looking, the resolution is degraded\n\nin azimuth as well. As we will see in the next section, the degradation of the\n\nresolution in range and azimuth will reduce the typical area made from the\n\ncombination of the critical baselines (see the smaller, dotted rectangles in\n\nFig. 14.4 compared to the nominal rectangles surrounding the receivers). The\n\nchoice of the baseline might be such that the nominal rectangles intersects, allowing\n\nfor phase connection and coherent processing, while the smaller rectangles attached\n\nto ambiguous contributions do not. The ambiguous contributions might be brighter\n\nin the receiver\u2019s images than in the Transmitter\u2019s, but they will not contribute at all\n\nin the interferometric products. Similarly, in case of super resolution products they\n\nwill not see their resolution improved.\n\n14.4 Products\n\nIndeed, the products of an interferometric Cartwheel system do not consist only in\n\nacross track interferometry but may include along track interferometry [7], super-\n\nresolution in azimuth and super-resolution in range. Volume scattering is also\n\nFig. 14.4 Frequency plane\n\n442 D. Massonnet\n\n\n\naccessible as the loss of coherence in the product is linked solely to the geometric\n\nfeature of the target rather than any time-dependent change.\n\nWe will not detail the features of across track or along track interferometry\n\nwith the associated metric (orthogonal baseline, altitude of ambiguity, speckle\n\ntime stability for ocean applications). It is however, worth mentioning that\n\ninterferograms can be formed not only with the two optimal images: that is the\n\nones that form the selected stable baseline at a given time, but also with the\n\nimage of the third receiver. The third image is a \u201cfree\u201d bonus that can help for\n\ninstance, unwrap the phase pattern of the nominal interferogram. A raw (i.e. not\n\nunwrapped) interferogram shows fringes that are not numbered. In other terms\n\nthere is an unknown integer number hidden behind each fringe. This number is\n\nusually guessed by reconstructing it by continuity across the image, an operation\n\ncalled phase unwrapping [8], with a high probability of errors. If an existing\n\nterrain model is accurate to within the difference of height represented by a\n\nfringe, it can be used to create and then subtract a fringe model that brings the\n\ninterferogram to values within a fringe, where no ambiguity exist anymore, thus\n\nallowing to refine the terrain model. Noting B the (almost) fixed Cartwheel\n\nvertical baseline, the third image can combine to the two other images with\n\nbaselines the sum of which is B. For topographic applications at a given incidence\n\nangle, the altitude of ambiguity h (i.e. the change in altitude that corresponds to a\nfull topographic fringe) is inversely proportional to the baseline, so that, labelling\n\nthe images by the receiver\u2019s number and the interferograms by their two images,\n\nwe have:\n\nh13 \u00bc 11\nh12\n\n\u00fe 1\nh23\n\nTwo wrapped interferograms can be added or subtracted, but can only be\n\nmultiplied by an integer factor, in order for the unknown fringe number to remain\n\nan integer. For instance if we multiply an interferogram by 2, an additional fringe\n\nwill be created between each existing fringes, the initial fringe numbers will turn\n\neven and the intermediate, new fringes will have odd numbers. Let us assume\n\nthat any interferogram can be multiplied by {2,3,?1,?2,?3} (larger integer\nfactors may increase the noise too much). By adding the results we can create\n\nany altitude of ambiguity h such that, if j and k belong to the above integer\nensemble:\n\nh \u00bc 1\nj\n\nh12\n\u00fe k\nh23\n\nIt can be shown [9] that the choice of h is so rich that a match can be found with\nthe accuracy of any available terrain model, practically removing the need for\n\nunwrapping and the associated errors. This trick is especially appealing with\n\n14 Cartwheel 443\n\n\n\nsimultaneous interferometry, where fringes are purely topographic and do not\n\ninclude signals such as from the atmosphere, that are unrelated to the baselines.\n\nThe independence of two images acquired simultaneously from two-point with\n\nan along-track separation is characterized by the critical horizontal baseline. It is\n\nsuch that the range difference between the receivers and a given ground target\n\nchanges by one wavelength from one pulse to the next. For coherent combination\n\nthe along track separation of two receivers must stay below this critical horizontal\n\nbaseline. The same way, we define a critical vertical baseline such that the range\n\ndifference seen by the second receiver, across the range pixel of the first receiver,\n\ndiffers from the range pixel size by one wavelength. Again, for coherent combina-\n\ntion of the passive images made by each receiver, the vertical separation of the\n\nreceivers must stay below this critical vertical baseline.\n\nWe consider the rectangular area in the plane containing the orbit of the\n\nsatellites, centred on each satellite, and having the critical vertical baseline as a\n\nheight and the critical horizontal baseline as a width. The resolution of an interfer-\n\nometric product results from the coherent part common to the intersecting areas of\n\nthe two receivers involved in the combination. It is inversely proportional to the\n\nrespective sizes of the intersection in azimuth and range. Similarly, the resolution of\n\nthe combined images of two receivers with intersecting areas is inversely propor-\n\ntional to the respective sizes of the union of their areas in azimuth and range. The\n\nsituation is illustrated in Fig. 14.3. To summarize, if r is the nominal resolution of\nthe Transmitter in range, and if a is the proportion of non-overlapping of the areas\nof two receivers in range, with 0 < a < 1, the resulting interferogram resolution\n\nFig. 14.3 Orbital plane\n\n444 D. Massonnet\n\n\n\nwill be r\n1\u00fea . The same formula applies in azimuth. The result of \u201csuper-synthesis\u201d in\n\nrange and azimuth is most efficient if the rectangular area is twice as large in\n\nazimuth, in order to match the orbital ellipse ratio. Since any super resolution\n\nprocessing needs to work coherently, i.e. with images connected in phase, the\n\narea of any image involved in the reconstruction shall intersect at least with one\n\nother image. The achievable resolution is therefore at most twofold better than the\n\ninitial resolution, except with a richer Cartwheel configuration (next section).\n\nThe relationship between the receiver\u2019s areas and the resolution of radar\n\nproducts comes from the fact that the geometric Fig. 14.3 can be turned into an\n\nequivalent frequency Fig. 14.4, where the critical baselines are replaced by the\n\ncorresponding bandwidths of the pulse repetition frequency (in azimuth) and chirp\n\ncontent (in range). For the sake of simplicity we do not distinguish here between the\n\nactual bandwidths and the corresponding sampling frequencies adapted to them. In\n\nFig. 14.4 the shaded area represents the resolution of the interferogram formed\n\nbetween images from receivers 1 and 3. In this example, its azimuth resolution\n\nwould be close to the one of the original images, while its range resolution is\n\ndegraded by about 2.5 due to a bandwidth reduced to 40% of the nominal chirp.\n\n14.5 Advanced Applications\n\nAlthough more complicated architectures are unlikely to fly before a first, basic\n\nCartwheel system is launched, such architectures are very appealing.\n\nAn advantage of using a synthetic band in range is the possibility to go beyond\n\nthe bandwidth allocation for any given bandwidth. This advantage is specially true\n\nfor the wavelengths with the smallest bandwidth allocation. Following a system\n\nwhich uses all the allocated bandwidth, for instance 80 MHz in L-band, with a range\n\nsuper-resolution factor of four (which requires at least six micro-satellites for\n\npermanent operations, orbiting on two concentric Cartwheels, see Fig. 14.3),\n\nwould create images that literally should not exist. In particular, very unusual\n\nratio between final range and/or azimuth pixel size and the wavelength would be\n\nachieved. Applying a super resolution factor of almost 4 on a 80 MHz is equivalent\n\nto 300 MHz, which in turn is about a quarter of the carrier frequency. In this\n\nexample, the above ratio is about 4, meaning that phase unwrapping could be\n\nachieved by exploiting the results of image correlation (a correlation accuracy\n\ndown to 25% of a pixel size seems easy to achieve). This would also give access\n\nto some new textural information and might revert some of the traditional prefer-\n\nence of the military toward shorter wavelengths.\n\nDeparting from the initial concept calling for using an opportunistic Transmitter,\n\nwe could imagine a specially designed Transmitter unable to receive its own signal,\n\nequipped with a large antenna capable of implementing a very strong protection\n\nagainst azimuth ambiguities. This \u201ctransmission only\u201d satellite could be easier to\n\nbuild because it does not have to mix strong and weak signals; it has no data\n\ntelemetry; it is not discrete but insensitive to jamming.\n\n14 Cartwheel 445\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the Cartwheel design could efficiently implement full or partial\n\npolarimetry using a Transmitter not necessarily fully polarimetric. This aspect\n\ncan be very powerful if combined with the volume scattering assessment. In\n\nsimultaneous interferometry, the blurring of the fringes, measured mathematically\n\nby the coherence, can only be due to a weak signal, which can be confirmed or not\n\nby the amplitude of the images, or by volume scattering. In the later case and taking\n\na very simple point of view, if the radar signal penetrates the vegetation by 3 m\n\nwhile the baseline creates a 12 m altitude of ambiguity (values taken as examples),\n\nthe fringe value will wobble within each pixel by up to 25% of a cycle, resulting in\n\npartial blurring. The analysis of this blurring (i.e. the coherence), possibly\n\nreinforced by the use of the third image which generally gives two additional\n\naltitudes of ambiguity, in addition to polarimetric capabilities, is likely to give\n\nunprecedented insight of the vegetation structure and properties [10].\n\nFinally, for environment survey, the optimal azimuth separation for azimuth\n\nsuper resolution is generally not optimal for ocean currents monitoring by along\n\ntrack interferometry. We already mentioned that a smaller Cartwheel of appropriate\n\nsize can be created from the nominal one at moderate fuel cost. However if we want\n\nboth missions permanently operated, then we could add two more receivers and\n\ncreate a small, additional Cartwheel using one of the receiver of the large Cartwheel\n\n(see Fig. 14.3 around s3).\n\nWith the Cartwheel design, a variety of missions can be generated from a\n\nrelatively simple brick that can itself be generic to a high degree.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The first BISSAT concept consisted of a small satellite,\n\nderived from the Italian MITA [2] bus (100\u2013300 kg mass range), and from a\n\nreceiving-only radar payload designed downsizing the sensor of COSMO/SkyMed\n\nmission. During the following years, and specifically during SABRINA phase 0/A\n\nstudy, the idea of a wider range of interferometric and bistatic experiments and\n\napplications was investigated [3], leading to an alternative definition of the BISSAT\n\nsatellite relying on PRIMA platform (400\u20131,500 kg mass range) [4] equipped with a\n\nradar system offering additional features with respect to the first generation\n\nCOSMO/SkyMed architecture. In this context the experimental nature of the\n\nmission can be matched to the dual and industrial nature of the COSMO/SkyMed\n\nprogram. SABRINA mission was then shifted to be a potential enhancement of\n\nCOSMO/SkyMed second generation.\n\nThe chapter is organized as follows: first of all potential applications and\n\ntechniques will be analyzed for both small (allowing for interferometric techniques)\n\nand large distances (signal phase difference cannot be exploited) in Sects. 15.3 and\n\n15.2, respectively. Then, design of relative trajectory will be summarized along\n\nwith an analysis of pointing strategies (Sect. 15.4). Finally, tradeoffs and safety\n\nconsiderations will be presented (Sect. 15.5).\n\nPart of this study was conducted with the financial support of the Italian Space\n\nAgency and of Thales Alenia Space Italia.\n\n15.2 Large Baseline Bistatic Applications and Techniques\n\nThe Large Baseline Bistatic (LBB) phase of the SABRINA mission envisages the\n\ncollection of monostatic-bistatic data with separations between the monostatic and\n\nthe bistatic sensors larger than the critical baseline. In this case the generated\n\ncouples of monostatic-bistatic SAR images are phase decorrelated and only the\n\namplitude differences between the images can be taken into account (see the Chaps.\n\n1 and 2 for the details about the critical baseline). Such incoherent combinations are\n\nused, in the framework of SABRINA mission, to investigate and experiment a wide\n\nrange of LBB techniques. The following subsections report a description of the\n\ntechniques and individuate potential products and applications.\n\nBefore analyzing more into details each LBB technique it\u2019s worth underlining\n\nsome useful characteristics of LBB observation geometry. For the sake of simplic-\n\nity Fig. 15.1 is used as a reference, where YTx is the incidence angle of the\ntransmitted signal, YRx is receiver incidence angle, F is the out-of-plane angle,\nand b is the bistatic angle. In addition, Z is the local vertical to the target area and\nYZ is the range elevation plane of the monostatic transmitting antenna.\n\nObservation geometries close to the in-plane condition (i.e.F ffi 0? orF ffi 180?)\nwith both bistatic and monostatic sensors working in side-looking mode are able to\n\nsignificantly minimize the pixel skewing effect generated by bistatic acquisition [5],\n\nthus improving the quality of the matched monostatic-bistatic couples. In addition,\n\n448 A. Moccia et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-2\n\n\naccording to [6], an improvement of in-plane scattering coefficients can be achieved\n\nifYTx > YRx. This combination is met by both same-side (Fffi 0?) and opposite side\n(F ffi 180?) geometries. However, bistatic ground range resolution is notably\ndegraded in opposite observation [5] and bistatic range ambiguities can appear [7]\n\ndepending on local surface relief variations, making very difficult the distinction of\n\nscattered signals from different regions of the illuminated area.\n\nAs far out-of-plane geometries are concerned, they are considered low-priority\n\nin the framework of the SABRINA mission, due to the meaningful expected signal\n\ndrop-off, the relevant image distortions and the lack of significant literature\n\nreferences (in particular with respect to in-plane LBB observations). On this basis\n\nall the selected LBB techniques to be investigated and experimented are thought for\n\nobservation geometries close to in-plane condition, in which the out-of-plane\n\nbaseline component is a small fraction and cross-track and radial ones.\n\nTable 15.1 summarizes the results of the performed LBB analysis and lists, for\n\nall the selected techniques, the relevant applications, products and impact on system\n\ndefinition. Further details can be found in following sub-sections.\n\n15.2.1 Radargrammetry of LBB Radar Signals\n\nThe application of stereo-radargrammetric techniques to monostatic-bistatic SAR\n\ndata gathered with large (>10?) bistatic angles represent a robust approach for\nDigital Elevation Model (DEM) generation on wide areas. Actually monostatic-\n\nbistatic radargrammetry is able to avoid temporal decorrelation, and unlike SAR\n\ninterferometry (InSAR) does not work with phase domain data so it is not affected\n\nby phase unwrapping problems and it is characterized by relaxed relative position-\n\ning requirements. For instance, 1 m baseline component error is assumed in the\n\nfollowing, that is about two orders of magnitude less than typical requirements for\n\nInSAR.\n\nThe actual possibility to combine monostatic and bistatic data reflected by\n\ncommon covered areas or targets depends on the possibility to co-register the\n\nimages, that is to project and resample them onto some common reference systems.\n\nFig. 15.1 Illustration of the\n\nmain LBB observation\n\nparameters\n\n15 Sabrina 449\n\n\n\nTable 15.1 Summary of LBB SAR techniques and application\n\nTechnique Application Products\n\nMain system\n\nparameter\n\n(operative mode,\n\nbaseline. . .)\n\nStarting\n\nstandard\n\nproduct\n\nRadargrammetry\n\nof LBB radar\n\nsignals\n\nTopography DEM \u2013 Stripmap with\n\nbaseline longer\n\nthan 130 km\n\nRaw\n\nand/or\n\nSLCa\n\n\u2013 Baseline\n\nuncertainty 1 m\n\nVelocity\n\nmeasurements\n\nby Doppler\n\nanalysis\n\nOceanography\n\nVelocity field\n\nVelocity map \u2013 Stripmap with\n\nbaseline longer\n\nthan 130 km\n\nRaw\n\nand/or\n\nSLC\n\n\u2013 Satellite antenna\n\nvelocity\n\nuncertainty\n\n0.05 m/s\n\n\u2013 Doppler centroid\n\nfrequency\n\nuncertainty 1 Hz\n\n\u2013 Attitude angle\n\nuncertainty 10\u20133\n\nHigh-resolution\n\nmeasurements\n\nof comp. of\n\nsea wave\n\nspectra\n\nOceanography Wave-motion\n\nmap\n\n\u2013 Stripmap with\n\nbaseline larger\n\nthan 200 km\n\nSLC\n\nand/or\n\nhigher\n\nlevel\n\nInvestigation of\n\nRCS in LBB\n\nradar signals\n\nRecognition and\n\nIdentification\n\n\u2013 Surface slope\n\nmap\n\n\u2013 Stripmap and\n\nspotlight\n\nSLC\n\nand/or\n\nhigher\n\nlevel\n\u2013 Surface\n\nroughness map\n\n\u2013 Minimum\n\nuseful range\n\nof bistatic\n\nangles 5?\u201320?\n\u2013 Discrimination\n\nmap among\n\nrural, urban\n\nand forest\n\nareas\n\nAttitude\n\ndetermination\n\nby using\n\nLBB-SAR\n\nraw data\n\nImage quality Measurement\n\nof attitude\n\nangles\n\nStripmap Raw\n\nand/or\n\nSLC\n\nImprovement of\n\nclassification\n\nand pattern\n\nrecognition\n\nprocedures\n\nImage quality Improvement\n\nof quality of\n\nCOSMOSky-\n\nMed products\n\nStripmap and\n\nspotlight\n\nSLC or\n\nhigher\n\nlevel\n\ndata\n\nasingle look complex\n\n450 A. Moccia et al.\n\n\n\nCo-registration accuracies of 1/10 of an image pixel or higher are routinely\n\nachieved in interferometric, i.e. short baseline, applications. However LBB\n\ngeometry represents a completely different, and new, situation with respect to\n\ninterferometric case. In a LBB scenario well-assessed interferometric co-\n\nregistration algorithms can fail because of the different LBB scattering\n\nproperties. Moreover the effect of local and irregular slope can make heavier\n\nthe risk of a failure in the co-registration processes. This means that novel\n\nalgorithm shall be developed. The same co-registration accuracy as in InSAR\n\ncan be therefore obtained only on particular areas characterized by favourable\n\nbistatic angles, topography and surface characteristics, but performance degrada-\n\ntion, up to 1/4 of an image pixel, must be taken into account for LBB\n\nco-registered products.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, and as reported in the Chap. 1, two different\n\napproaches exist for surface relief determination from LBB data:\n\n\u2013 Parallax-based methods, which principle is borrowed from optical\nphotogrammetry.\n\n\u2013 True stereo radar methods, which rely on the peculiarities of radar and SAR\nacquisition.\n\nAn error budget has been developed for both methods, considering\n\nCOSMO/SkyMed operating in nominal stripmap mode [8] with 25?\u201350? incidence\nangles and the bistatic sensor collecting bistatic echoes from in-plane same-side\n\ngeometry with the bistatic angle ranging from 10? to 45? (50\u2013550 km baseline).\nThe results show that the performance of parallax-based methods is strongly\n\ndependant on the capability to reduce co-registration errors: only decametre-scale\n\nheight accuracy can be robustly achieved. On the contrarymetric scale (<4m) height\naccuracy can be obtained by true stereo methods with the performance very\n\nweakly influenced by baseline length, transmitting and receiving incidence angles\n\nand image matching errors.\n\nThe reported results obviously refer to uncertainty of the measure or relative\n\naccuracy. As far as the absolute error of the generated DEM is concerned, consid-\n\nering the bistatic single-pass scenario and the proper utilization of a limited number\n\nof ground control points, it is reasonable to assume less than 20 m absolute height\n\nerrors with improved accuracy, lower or close to 10 m, under favourable\n\nconditions.\n\nAccording to Fig. 15.2, where U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency\n\n(NIMA) specifications on DEM accuracy [9] are reported, the possibility to comply\n\nwith high-resolution terrain information (HRTI)-3 specifications on particular areas\n\nis clear, whereas NIMA digital terrain elevation data (DTED)-2 can be met under\n\nless restrictive condition and, hence, on global scale.\n\nFinally, it is important to point out that the reported results are derived with\n\nreference to the nominal COSMOSkyMed stripmap mode and a further perfor-\n\nmance improvement at the cost of a reduced covered area can be guaranteed by the\n\nexploitation of higher resolution spotlight monostatic-bistatic image pairs.\n\n15 Sabrina 451\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-1\n\n\n15.2.2 Velocity Measurements by Doppler Analysis\n\nA procedure to compute the two slant range components of the target velocity is\n\ndescribed in Ref. [10]. The procedure, different from along-track interferometry, is\n\nbased on the computation of monostatic and bistatic Doppler centroid frequencies\n\nand in the equations relating the centroids to the parameters of monostatic-bistatic\n\ngeometry, such as position/velocity vectors of both monostatic and bistatic sensors\n\nand monostatic/bistatic slant ranges.\n\nThe application of the technique is subsequent or simultaneous with the solution\n\nof the stereo intersection problem, therefore similar to the previous section are the\n\nconstrains about acquisition geometry and baseline determination accuracy. In\n\naddition, the adaptation to the SABRINA mission of the error budget analysis\n\ncarried out in Ref. [10], assuming an uncertainty of 0.05 m/s about monostatic\n\nand bistatic satellite antenna velocity, an uncertainty of 1 Hz about monostatic and\n\nbistatic Doppler centroid frequency and 0.01? attitude angle uncertainty, leads to\ntarget velocity measurement uncertainty lower than 1 m/s.\n\nMore attractive applications of this technique are oceanographic, being possible\n\nto generate velocity and direction maps of sea wave. The most suitable operative\n\nmode is stripmap, even if monostatic bistatic acquisitions can be used to derive\n\nhigher resolution data.\n\n15.2.3 High-Resolution Measurements of Components\nof Sea Wave Spectra\n\nOceanographic applications can take advantages of high-resolution wave-\n\nmotion maps derived by exploiting some theoretical features of LBB geometry.\n\nDTED1\n\n5m 10m 15m 20m 25m\n\nAbsolute Vertical Accuracy\n(90% linear error)\n\nRelative Vertical Accuracy\n(90% linear point-to point error)\n\n30m\n\nDTED2\n\nHRTI-3\n\nHRTI-4\n\nFig. 15.2 Standard levels\n\nfor DTED and HRTI provided\n\nby NIMA specifications\n\n452 A. Moccia et al.\n\n\n\nActually LBB observation can potentially offer, with respect to its monostatic\n\ncounterpart [11]:\n\n\u2013 A different Bragg-resonant sea-wave cross-track component (thus providing an\n\nadditional information on sea state).\n\n\u2013 A wider range of sea wave spectrum, in which an approximately linear SAR\n\nmodulation transfer function is applicable for removing the azimuth shift\n\nbetween a scattering element real position and its imaged position (due to the\n\nmean value of the radial component of the long wave orbital velocity in the\n\nresolution cell).\n\n\u2013 A reduction in azimuth resolution degradation due to instantaneous radial\n\nvelocity of sea surface facets within a resolution cell during synthetic aperture.\n\nThe possibility to effectively attain this performance improvement is closely\n\nconnected to the implemented formation flying trajectory. Actually, very large\n\nbaselines and bistatic angles are needed to assure a meaningful improvement of\n\nbistatic performance with respect to monostatic one. For the sake of concreteness,\n\naccording to the models presented in the Chap. 1, a baseline length of\n\n250\u2013300 km, that is a bistatic angle of about 25?, can guarantee a 5% wider\nrange of linearity region and a 10% reduction in azimuth resolution degradation.\n\nSimilarly, baselines shorter than 150 km lead to performance improvement\n\nsmaller than 1\u20132%.\n\n15.2.4 Investigation of RCS in LBB Radar Signals\n\nThe difference between monostatic and bistatic radar cross sections (RCS) of land\n\ntargets represents the starting point of ad-hoc developed techniques for estimating\n\nland surface parameters. Specifically, surface roughness and dielectric constant\n\nmaps can be generated by collecting couples of single-pass monostatic-bistatic\n\nSAR data characterized by large bistatic angles (>10?). Actually the scattering\nfrom smooth surfaces is extremely different when the same smooth area is observed\n\nby two different directions, whereas with the increasing surface roughness this\n\nvariability becomes very weak. In addition, the same principle can be applied to\n\nproduce discrimination maps between different areas, such are rural, urban and\n\nforested, by processing multi-angle LBB acquisitions. Finally LBB reflectivity can\n\nbe also used for slop determination since it has been demonstrated [12] that LBB\n\nscattering coefficient can be related to the root mean square surface slope within a\n\nresolution cell.\n\nAs noted above, multi-angle acquisitions are needed to investigate RCS in\n\nmonostatic-bistatic SAR data. More in detail, it is possible to state that useful\n\nbistatic angles start from 5?, but from a scientific point of view the need for a better\ncharacterization of bistatic radar cross section requires acquisitions at variable\n\nbistatic angles from 5? up to 20?, at least.\n\n15 Sabrina 453\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-1\n\n\n15.2.5 Attitude Determination by Using LBB SAR Raw Data\n\nAccurate SAR antenna pointing determination can be conducted on the basis of\n\nLBB radar echoes. The technique [13] takes advantage of the Doppler\n\ncharacteristics of the received signal to compute pitch and yaw attitude angles of\n\nthe spacecraft and it relies on echo amplitude analysis for roll. Neither preliminary\n\nattitude estimate is needed, nor instantaneous cooperation from the spacecraft\n\ncarrying the transmitting radar is required. Several applications can be conceived\n\nfor this technique, but the main expected one is an accurate SAR antenna pointing\n\nestimation to improve LBB SAR data focusing. Actually, in order to generate high\n\nquality focused SAR images, antenna pointing is very important because it signifi-\n\ncantly affects critical parameters of synthetic aperture coherent processing (e.g.\n\nDoppler band, Doppler centroid, Doppler frequency rate, range migration) and\n\nimage calibration (e.g. directional antenna gain compensation in the observed\n\nswath).\n\nA test of this technique was performed in Ref. [13] based on SIR-C real SAR\n\ndata with regards to the configuration of coincident receiving and transmitting\n\nantennas, therefore in a monostatic repeat-track scenario. The experimentation\n\nshowed the possibility to achieve root mean square deviations in the order of\n\n0.01? for yaw and pitch angles and of 0.1? for roll angle, but an important\nperformance improvement is expected for single-pass bistatic acquisitions.\n\nThe major goal of the experimentation of this technique within the framework of\n\nSABRINA mission is to validate a simple technology for SAR antenna pointing\n\nestimation. This aims at the validation of an innovative concept for SAR-based\n\nspace remote sensing, that is equipping the spacecraft with low-cost, medium-\n\nperformance attitude sensors for mission phases when relaxed requirements exist,\n\nto switch to high-accuracy pointing during SAR operation through the exploitation\n\nof data produced by the radar instrument. It would be of great benefit from several\n\npoints of view: cost, number of on-board instruments, power consumption, mass,\n\nwhich are important especially in the case of small platforms. Concerning this, high\n\naccuracy attitude sensor embarked on the BISSAT satellite can could be used as\n\nreference measurements to definitively validate the technique.\n\n15.2.6 Improvement of Classification and Pattern Recognition\nProcedures\n\nThe quality of standard monostatic COSMOSkyMed products can benefit from the\n\nintegration with LBB SAR data. First of all, signals from retro-reflectors that are\n\nvery strong in monostatic images are smoothed in LBB SAR data, so weak signals\n\nappear more prominent. Consequently more and different details can be detected in\n\nLBB-SAR images thus improving the combined, monostatic-bistatic, mapping\n\ncapabilities. Moreover the proper exploitation of different polarization channels,\n\n454 A. Moccia et al.\n\n\n\nboth in transmission and in reception, represent an additional possibility to improve\n\nclassification and pattern recognition procedures. Finally an increase of the signal-\n\nto-noise ratio (SNR) can be obtained by incoherent integration of monostatic-\n\nbistatic, phase decorrelated, signals. The improved SNR influences positively\n\nsome essential image quality parameters, such as geometric/radiometric resolutions\n\nand integrated/peak side-to-lobe ratio.\n\n15.3 Interferometric and Polarimetric Applications\n\nThe implementation and validation of a wide series of techniques based on the\n\ncoherent combination of monostatic and bistatic data is planned within SABRINA\n\nprogram. This includes, but is not limited to, along and cross-track interferometry,\n\ncoherent resolution enhancement, tomography, polarimetric SAR interferometry.\n\nImportant literature is available about potentials and challenges of such techniques,\n\nfor these reasons the following sub-sections will focus only on the peculiar aspects\n\nof SABRINA, with specific reference to along-track and cross-track interferometry.\n\n15.3.1 Along-Track Bistatic SAR Interferometry\n\nThe operation of an along-track interferometer (ATI) is based on the acquisition of\n\ntwo SAR images taken under identical geometry of observation, but separated by a\n\nshort time interval.When this is accomplished, any difference between the two images\n\nresults from changes in the scene. In particular, the phase difference between the\n\nechoes from the same target allows its radial speed to be measured. A crucial\n\nparameter of an along-track InSAR is the time lag between the two images, which\n\nis determined by the along-track distance between the two antennas, the platform\n\nvelocity and the mode of operation of the transmit/receive chains [14]. Specifically, in\n\norder to avoid ambiguities and issues related to phase unwrapping procedures, phase\n\ndifferences must not exceed 2p, and this establishes a constraint on the most suitable\nbaseline. In addition phase noise puts a limit on the minimum detectable velocity.\n\nSeveral applications can take potentially take advantage of this technique [3]:\n\n\u2013 Marine science studies and climate modeling\u2014in order to obtain clear\nsignatures of surface current variations, the incidence angle of an ATI system\n\nshould be as high as possible. Ideal incidence angles for current measurements\n\nby ATI with reasonable nonlinearities and coherence should be between about\n\n35? and 45?. Sea surface current monitoring is also important to understand the\ninfluence on the weather and the global climate.\n\n\u2013 Flood\u2014a flood map presents the extension of an area which has been flooded\nduring a specific high discharge event. Such information is very useful for civil\n\nprotection activities because it immediately provides the list of areas and\n\n15 Sabrina 455\n\n\n\nstructures struck by similar events. Classification, segmentation and composite\n\ncolor images techniques can be improved by exploiting the interferometric\n\ncoherence between a couple of SAR images. ATI can also contribute to realize\n\nflood velocity map applied to large rivers and streams by the same techniques\n\nused for marine application.\n\n\u2013 Fisheries management\u2014the application of synthetic aperture radar for surveil-\nlance of commercial fishing can aid in the detection of illegal fishing activities\n\nand provide more efficient use of limited aircraft or patrol craft resources. Many\n\nnations have vast economic enterprise zones that cannot be monitored for fishing\n\nactivities with the available patrol resources. With SAR, large sea areas can be\n\nmonitored on frequent revisit schedules, thus allowing detected ships to be\n\nobserved and identified by patrols that are vectored on these targets from cuing\n\nderived from the SAR information. Along-track interferometric SAR allows the\n\nenhanced detection of moving targets on the ocean surface including ships and\n\nship wakes. In this context, it is important to remark that the velocity\n\nmeasurements provided by along-track In-SAR are independent of the RCS.\n\nConsequently, InSAR allows detection of small ships which may not be much\n\nbrighter than the background ocean clutter. If such ships have a velocity compo-\n\nnent in the radial direction which is different to that of the surrounding ocean,\n\nthey will show up as anomalies in the velocity image. An added advantage is that\n\none can estimate true velocities from radial velocities if the ship\u2019s heading, which\n\ncan be determined from either its shape or its wake, is known. In ATI images there\n\nwill be little correlation of the ocean backscatter in the two images but there will\n\nbe a large correlation in the backscatter from ships. By using a measure of the\n\ncorrelation between the two acquisitions it is possible to detect ships.\n\n\u2013 Traffic management\u2014traffic monitoring from space is quite rare, however first\nexperimentations [15\u201317] have been already carried-out.\n\nTable 15.2 reports the best along-track baseline range for each application along\n\nwith the most suitable SAR operative modes. The detection of high velocities\n\nrequires very short time separations. With regard to SABRINA mission scenario\n\nTable 15.2 Applications, products for ATI techniques\n\nApplication Product\n\nBaseline\n\nmin (Speed)\n\nBaseline\n\nmax (Speed) SAR operative mode\n\nMarine\n\nstudies\n\nCurrent\n\nmonitoring\n\n15 m (28 km/h) 40 m (11 km/h) ScanSAR\n\nFlood Flood velocity\n\nmap\n\n10 m (70 km/h) 15 m (28 km/h) Stripmap/ScanSAR\n\nFlood Flood extension\n\nmap\n\n40 m (11 km/h) 400 m (1 km/h) Spotlight/Stripmap/ScanSAR\n\nTraffic Traffic\n\nmonitoring\n\n12 m (50 km/h) 20 m (20 km/h) Spotlight/Stripmap\n\nFisheries Ship detecting 20 m (20 km/h) 40 m (11 km/h) Stripmap/ScanSAR\n\nFisheries (Slow) Ship\n\nmonitoring\n\n200 m (2 km/h) 400 m (1 km/h) Stripmap/ScanSAR\n\n456 A. Moccia et al.\n\n\n\nvery short along-track components (20\u2013100 m) can be reached, without\n\ncompromising the overall safety requirements, only together with a meaningful\n\ncross-track one. In this case local topography can represent an additional contribu-\n\ntion to monostatic-bistatic phase difference other than target velocity. When\n\nobserving marine targets or ocean areas the effect of topography is expected to be\n\nnot much significant, but topographic terms must be removed on solid Earth by\n\nexploiting a digital elevation model.\n\n15.3.2 Across-Track Bistatic SAR Interferometry\n\nAn important possibility to complement and complete COSMO/SkyMed measure-\n\nment capabilities by SABRINA mission deals with DEM generation. COSMO/\n\nSKyMed mission has not been designed to produce high quality DEM. According\n\nto Table 15.3, where the expected accuracy of topography DEM generated by\n\nCOSMO/SkyMed [8] is reported, COSMO/SkyMed could generate, in the best\n\nconditions, using high resolution spotlight acquisitions, DTED 2 topographic\n\ndata. In addition it is worth noting that COSMO/SkyMed was not designed to\n\nproduce DEM attaining international standards because, in general, the achievable\n\nrelative accuracy is too close to the absolute one. Finally, wide areas, i.e. global,\n\nDTED 2 topographic data can be gathered with much difficulty because of the\n\nspotlight operating mode and the need of good coherence values in repeat-pass\n\nacquisitions, of correct baselines, incidence angles and terrain slopes.\n\nThe COSMO/SkyMed-BISSAT formation, instead, can be exploited also as a\n\nsingle-pass cross-track SAR interferometer for high quality DEM generation.\n\nIndeed, DEM generation can greatly benefit from the simultaneous acquisition of\n\nthe two images in the bistatic configuration as compared with the repeat-pass case.\n\nIn fact, a considerable drop in the attainable performance results from the\n\ndecorrelation of interferometric image pairs acquired with time separation, due to\n\nradar wavelength-scale changes occurred in the scene between the observations. In\n\naddition, atmospheric artifacts equally affect the two acquisitions of the bistatic\n\nconfiguration, thanks to the simultaneity and the slight difference in viewing\n\ngeometry. Analogous perturbations result in both images, specifically in the echo\n\nsignal phase, so that the resulting interferometric product is nearly insensitive to\n\nthem. In addition also digital elevation models and slope maps produced by LBB\n\nTable 15.3 COSMO/SkyMed interferometric DEM performance [8]\n\nSAR operative mode\n\nVertical\n\nAccuracy Specification\n\nSpotlight\n\n(m)\n\nStripmap\n\n(m)\n\nScanSAR\n\n(Wide) (m)\n\nScanSAR\n\n(Huge) (m)\n\nRelative 90% linear\n\npoint-to-point\n\nerror\n\n12 28 56 123\n\nAbsolute 90% linear error 13 28 46 95\n\n15 Sabrina 457\n\n\n\nradargrammetric techniques can be integrated and can support the phase\n\nunwrapping process in critical areas characterized by high terrain slope, irregular\n\ntopography or vegetation.\n\nThe quality of a DEM generated from a single pass-cross track spaceborne\n\ninterferometer mainly depends on the observation geometry, the formation flying\n\nknowledge and control, and the phase error of monostatic-bistatic image pairs.\n\nSeveral error budget models are available to assess DEM accuracy and precision\n\nand some references are also reported in this book (see for example the Chap. 2).\n\nThose methodologies have been applied to SABRINA case considering two differ-\n\nent scenarios:\n\n\u2013 Single-pass bistatic interferometric acquisitions, with the baseline representing a\n\nsmall fraction of the critical baseline, formedium-to-high qualityDEMgeneration.\n\n\u2013 Multi-passes bistatic interferometric data with proper combinations of small and\n\nlarge baseline acquisitions for the highest quality DEM generation.\n\nIn both cases 1 mm baseline component knowledge was assumed along with 25?\n\nphase error. In the single-pass bistatic case the selected orthogonal baselines were\n\n400\u2013700 m for spotlight acquisitions and 200\u2013600 m for stripmap ones, whereas for\n\nmulti-passes DEM generation the possibility to exploit up to 1 km orthogonal\n\nbaselines for spotlight and 800 m for stripmap was analyzed. The conclusion of this\n\npreliminary analysis has been that SABRINAmission is potentially able to generate a\n\nglobal digital elevation model according to NIMA DTED 3 standard, and moreover\n\nHRTI 4 topographic data can be gathered on specific area under favorable conditions.\n\n15.4 Mission Analysis\n\n15.4.1 Small Baseline Phase\n\n15.4.1.1 Relative Trajectory\n\nA number of relative orbital trajectories have been proposed to perform SAR\n\ninterferometry. TOPSAT [18, 19], a joint NASA/ASI program, was the first mission\n\nto be studied with this goal and made use of the \u201cparallel\u201d orbit concept, that is to\n\nsay orbits only separated by ascending node right ascension and time of passage on\n\nthe ascending node. In more recent years Massonnet [20, 21] introduced the\n\ncartwheel concept (see Chap. 14 for details) building on eccentricity and adequate\n\nphasing of orbit perigees to achieve prescribed satellite distance. Then, the pendu-\n\nlum concept [22], based on differences in ascending node right ascension and orbit\n\ninclination, came up as a cartwheel generalization. DLR also introduced the helix\n\nconcept [23] building on differences of the ascending node right ascensions and the\n\neccentricity, which has been applied in the Tandem-X mission (see Chap. 13) and\n\nalso discussed in Chap. 3.\n\n458 A. Moccia et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-14\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-13\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-3\n\n\nDifferent relative trajectory options to complement the Italian mission COSMO/\n\nSkyMed with interferometric capabilities have been extensively analyzed and com-\n\npared by Moccia and Fasano [24]. The approach was to define suitable baseline\n\nranges for interferometry and to evaluate the useful orbit fraction guaranteed by the\n\ndifferent formations. Additional analysis were later performed by Fasano and\n\nD\u2019Errico [25, 26] defining optimal baselines in view of accuracy and ambiguity\n\nrequirements and trying to achieve these baselines at all the latitudes along the orbit.\n\nOn the basis of the latter approach, a helix formation was selected as the\n\noperational one, while formation geometries derived in Ref. [24] were considered\n\nto experiment autonomous formation flying and to achieve larger baselines useful\n\nin multi-passes scenarios.\n\nWe herein summarize the relative trajectories which were selected as candidates\n\nto test both the different aspects of formation flying and bistatic SAR techniques\n\n(along-track interferometry, ATI; cross-track interferometry, XTI):\n\n\u2013 Cartwheel XTI\u2014bistatic satellite and a COSMO/SkyMed satellite in a\n\ncartwheel-derived configuration, with nominal eccentricity and a perigee sepa-\n\nration (Do) of 20.74?;\n\u2013 Cartwheel ATI\u2014as before but perigee separation of 0.52?;\n\u2013 De XTI\u2014bistatic satellite on an orbit with different eccentricity (e \u00bc 7.62 ? 10?4)\n\nbut both perigees at 90?;\n\u2013 De ATI\u2014as before but e \u00bc 1.169 ? 10?3;\n\u2013 Do ATI\u2014bistatic satellite with different perigee anomaly (o \u00bc 89.9988?\n\ninstead of 90?);\n\u2013 Pendulum XTI\u2014satellites on pendulum configuration with DO \u00bc 0.0162? and\n\nDM \u00bc ?5 ? 10?3?;\n\u2013 Pendulum ATI\u2014as before but DO \u00bc 4.18 ? 10?5?, DM \u00bc ?6.18 ? 10?4?.\n\u2013 Helix XTI\u2014DO \u00bc 4.9 ? 10?3? (DM \u00bc 0?, Do \u00bc 0?) and De \u00bc 1.28 ? 10?4\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 15.3, the selected helix formation allows obtaining an\n\neffective baseline in the range 500\u2013700 m at all the achievable latitudes, since\n\npositive and negative latitudes are observed in different phases of the orbit (ascend-\n\ning/descending). As a consequence of this, interferometric performance in terms of\n\nambiguity and resolution has a limited dependency on latitude. Height accuracy and\n\nheight of ambiguity are depicted in Fig. 15.4 as a function of time.\n\n15.4.1.2 Maneuvers and DV Budgets\n\nRelative orbital trajectories for SAR interferometry require small distance between\n\nsatellites, which can be achieved by a single launch strategy. With reference\n\nto COSMO/SkyMed, one could also maneuver one satellite in the constellation to\n\nbring it closer to the following/preceding one (satellites are placed in the same\n\norbital plane at a nominal anomaly shift of 90?). In this latter case, a maneuver\nstrategy can be established [28]: if a satellite has to gain (lose) an anomaly shift to\n\nreach the preceding (succeeding) satellite, it must be speeded up (down), thus its\n\n15 Sabrina 459\n\n\n\norbital period must be reduced (increased), which in turn implies a reduction\n\n(increase) of the semi major axis. In particular, the maneuvering satellite has to\n\ngain (lose) a given time. Thus, the maneuvering satellite can be transferred over an\n\nelliptic orbit with a lower perigee (higher apogee) and apogee (perigee) at the initial\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nhe\nig\n\nht\n a\n\ncc\nur\n\nac\ny \n\n(m\n)\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ntime (orbit fraction)\n\nhe\nig\n\nht\n o\n\nf a\nm\n\nbi\ngu\n\nity\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nFig. 15.4 Accuracy and ambiguity along the orbit for the considered helix formation (phase noise\n\ntaken into account, time computed from the passage at perigee)\n\nDeputy at orbit\npole (North)\n\nDeputy at \nascending node\n\nDeputy at orbit\npole (South)\n\nLine of sight\n\nTo Earth\nDeputy at\n\ndescending\nnode\n\nDeputy at orbit\npole (South) Deputy\n\nat\nnodes \n\nChief\n\nFig. 15.3 Effective baseline as a function of latitude with DO \u00bc 0.0049? and De \u00bc?1.28 ? 10?4\n(Reproduced with kind permission from Springer Science + Business Media B.V. # 2009\nSpringer Published in Ref.

This approach allows to perform the maneuver in a\n\nshort time (approximately one nominal orbit period), but in case of large anomaly\n\nshift produces large semimajor axis variation and, consequently, large DV. To\nreduce the required DV to acceptable levels, one has to spend multiple orbital\nperiods over the maneuvering ellipse, trading propellant versus time. In the case of\n\nCOSMO/SkyMed, Fig. 15.5 shows required DV versus time spent on maneuvering\nellipse. A maneuvering time of 6 days was preliminary selected for a first guess DV\nbudget of about 19 m/s for this phase.\n\nIn order to estimate the required DV to perform different formation flying and\npayload operation campaigns, different maneuver approaches were studied and\n\nmodeled [28]. Their application to the selected potential interferometric relative\n\ntrajectories showed that a DV of the order of a few meters per second and maximum\nfor non coplanar transfers should be budget for any trajectory change. All maneuver\n\ntimes are shorter than 200 min.\n\n15.4.2 Large Baseline Phase\n\n15.4.2.1 Large Baseline BSAR Concept\n\nAs discussed in the previous sections, the large baseline bistatic SAR relies on two\n\nsatellites flying at distance quite larger than the ones required for interferometric\n\napplications. Selection of the candidate relative trajectory has been discussed in\n\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n?V (m/s)\n\ntim\ne \n\n(h\nou\n\nrs\n)\n\nperigee decreased\napogee raised\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\ntim\ne \n\n(d\nay\n\ns)\n\nFig. 15.5 DV as a function of the maneuvering time required to reach the following/preceding\nCOSMO/SkyMed satellite\n\n15 Sabrina 461\n\n\n\ngeneral in Chap. 3 (Sect. 3.4.3). We herein only recall that satellite separation is to\n\nbe achieved in \u201chorizontal\u201d, i.e. along approximately the elevation direction of the\n\nradars. This condition can be typically achieved by a separation between the two\n\nascending nodes (DO) and an adequate selection of the in-plane satellite separation\n(Du), i.e. of an adequate time shift between the two satellite node crossing time.\n\nIt is clear that large baseline bistatic SAR strongly depends on the capability to\n\nsuperimpose the transmitting and the receiving radar swaths, i.e. on the pointing of the\n\ntwo radars. Superimposition can be in general achieved by electronic pointing of\n\nthe radars, or by attitude maneuvers of the two satellites, or by a combination of both.\n\nIn designing such pointing, one has to consider that SAR satellites typically perform a\n\nyaw steering maneuver to align the antenna with the spacecraft-atmosphere relative\n\nvelocity to the aim of reducing aerodynamic drag. A general analysis of potential\n\nsolutions to guarantee adequate overlap between the two radar swaths for large\n\nbaseline bistatic SAR has been proposed in Ref. [29] and applied in Ref. [30] for\n\nthe case of a small, parasitic satellite flying in formation with a large SAR satellite. In\n\nthe framework of SABRINA mission, both radars would share the same pointing\n\ncapabilities, achieved thanks to their active phased antennas able to steer the beam\n\nelectronically both in elevation (off nadir angle can be varied between 23.3? and 43.7?,\nright looking) and in azimuth direction (?3?). These capabilities have been integrated\non COSMO/SkyMed radar to implement different radar working modes, but they\n\ncan be also used to program radar pointing adequate to guarantee swath overlap.\n\nWhen both radars can point the line-of-sight, flexibility in swath selection is\n\ngreatly improved, as shown in Fig. 15.6 where the graphical concept of the large\n\nbaseline bistatic SAR is presented in a simplified geometry with both radars sharing\n\nthe same elevation plane. In particular, the elevation steering capability generates a\n\npotential area (access area) where the nominal radar swath can be selected. There-\n\nfore, if both radars can be steered in elevation, a bistatic access area (BAA) can be\n\nalso be defined as the one where both swaths can be positioned.\n\nBAA dimensions decrease with growing horizontal separation between the\n\nplatforms. If BAA is larger than radar real swath, bistatic target can be selected\n\nwithin BAA by COSMO and BISSAT pointing, otherwise pointing variability is\n\nlost. When the latter condition is reached at zero latitude, the maximum horizontal\n\nseparation along the orbit is achieved, which also maximizes the bistatic angle. In\n\nfact if horizontal separation is further increased, bistatic acquisitions over the\n\nequator are no longer possible. This orbital condition will be referred to as \u201cfinal\n\nbistatic configuration\u201d (in the case of the \u201cdynamic\u201d large baseline formation, see\n\nSect. 3.4.3). Finally, satellite horizontal separation, bistatic angle, and BAA also\n\nvary along the orbit due to changing relative geometry.\n\n15.4.2.2 Relative Trajectory Options (Static and Dynamic)\n\nAs recalled above, the \u201cstatic\u201d or \u201cfinal\u201d bistatic configuration is referred to as a\n\nlarge baseline formation that allows bistatic observations at the equator with\n\nmaximum bistatic angle.\n\n462 A.

[29] by selecting the\n\nmaximum off nadir angle for the active satellite (43.7?) and the minimum one for\nthe passive satellite (23.3?).

If elevation steering is only considered, one gets that dO \u00bc 3.19? and\ndM \u00bc 0.65? are needed.\n\nThis final bistatic configuration can be reached starting from a close formation\n\ndedicated to SAR interferometry, if differential J2 effects due to a small change in\n\ninclination are properly exploited. Intermediate geometries are referred to as\n\n\u201cintermediate\u201d, \u201cdrifting\u201d, or \u201cdynamic\u201d bistatic formations.\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 3.4.3, the excessive along-track drift that derives from the\n\nchange in inclination can be compensated either by applying periodical anomaly\n\ncorrections, or by using fine semi-major axis control to tune the along-track drift in\n\nthe desired way.\n\nOf course, anomaly corrections have a cost in term of additional DV, which can\nbe reduced if a smaller number of (longer) correction maneuvers is applied. The\n\ncost to be paid is then a larger maximum along track separation, which implies\n\nlarger attitude/point angles required for swaths superimposition.\n\nFigure 15.7 depicts the different options from a qualitative point of view, while\n\nFig. 15.8 reports the total DV needed to pass from a close formation to the final\n\n0\nout-of-plane separation\n\nin\n-p\n\nla\nne\n\n s\nep\n\nar\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nideal out- and in-plane drifts - both da & di required\n\nonly required out-of-plane drift - di only, correction maneuvers expected\n\n1 manuever at end of drift\n\n3 maneuvers\n\n10 maneuvers\n\n30 maneuvers\n\nFig. 15.7 Qualitative view of different strategies for achieving drifting bistatic formations\n\n464 A.

For example, the DV expense for activating a drifting BSAR\nformation with a di of 0.1? is of about 13 m/s. As noted in Sect. 3.4.3, a small\ndifference in eccentricity (order 1 ? 10?4) can also be used in order to separate the\norbits at the poles (argument of perigee 90?). An additional DV of 13 m/s is required\nif nodal drift has to be stopped once the final bistatic configuration has been\n\nreached.\n\n15.4.2.3 Safe Establishment of Relative Trajectory\n\nA critical aspect when considering dynamic large baseline BSAR formations is the\n\nsafe establishment of relative trajectory at the beginning of the maneuver.\n\nIn fact, depending on the initial formation geometry, establishment of di (order\n0.1?) with a single impulse commanded at a node of the orbit can dramatically\nreduce the separation in the radial/cross-track plane. This creates a collision risk\n\nsince the two orbits can intersect and satellite separation is then only based on\n\nalong-track baseline control.\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\nmaneuvering time (days)\n\n?V\n (\n\nm\n/s\n\n)\n30 corrections\n\n10 corrections (each one lasting 3 orbits)\n\n3 corrections (each one lasting 10 orbits)\n\nFig. 15.8 DV required to pass to the final bistatic configuration as a function of manoeuvring time\nand number of foreseen in-plane corrections of anomaly relative drift\n\n15 Sabrina 465\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-4541-3\n\n\nLet us consider a XTI helix as the initial formation geometry. Collision risk can\n\nbe mitigated by applying a very small di to let dO increase for some time before\ngoing to the operational di. For example we can consider three phases:\n\n1. di of 0.005? (de \u00bc 1.28 ? 10?4 still stands): minimum distance in cross-track\nplane is slightly less than 500 m (Fig. 15.9). In 50 orbits dO increases from\n0.0049? to 0.007?.\n\n2. di increased to 0.01?: minimum distance in cross-track plane is about 600 m\n(Fig. 15.9). This phase also has a duration of 50 orbits.\n\n3. di to 0.1?, da \u00bc 9.7 m: drifting formation. After 1,500 orbits dO ? 1.27?\n(Fig. 15.10).\n\nDrifting bistatic formation stability in along-track is evident in Fig. 15.11, which\n\nis a very good results because at each nodal passing the deputy remains in the\n\nvicinity of the chief radar elevation angle allowing a feasible pointing strategy and\n\nSNR. It is worth noting that a certain along-track drift is needed to ensure that for\n\nincreasing nodal separation the passive satellite lies near the active radar elevation\n\nplane at equator passing.\n\n15.5 Relative Distance and Safety\n\nIn order to analyze safety conditions, time history of the satellite formation in the\n\ndifferent configurations discussed in Sects. 15.4.1.1 and 15.4.2 have been simulated\n\nand verifiedwith respect to expected shapes derived from analyticalmodels (Chap. 3).\n\n?2?1.5?1?0.500.511.52\n?1\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nz (km)\n\nx \n(k\n\nm\n)\n\norbit 1\norbit 50\norbit 51\norbit 100\n\nFig. 15.9 Relative trajectory projection on the radial/cross-track plane during phases 1 and\n\n2 (Reproduced with kind permission from Springer Science + Business Media B.V. # 2010\nSpringer Published in Ref.

On the grounds of this outcomes (Table 15.4), different candidate forma-\n\ntion flying domains and relative requirements can be preliminarily identified\n\n(Table 15.5). In particular, the following rules of thumb have been used: (a) control\n\naccuracy of two orders of magnitude less than minimum distance foreseen for the\n\nconsidered domain; (b) relative position measurement (on-board, real time) at least at\n\none order of magnitude less than control accuracy (two orders of magnitude\n\nassumed). With these definitions, it is expected to have always tight formation flying\n\nfor along track interferometry and close or fair formation flying for cross-track\n\ninterferometry. Whereas, in the case of large baseline applications, formation flying\n\ngradually evolves from fair to loose and far.\n\nRelative distance is clearly connected to collision risk, although the latter one\n\nstrongly depends on relative orbit. In fact, if the minimum distance is kept only for\n\nshort times per orbit cycles (as an example near points of orbit intersections) the\n\nsystem has enough time to measure and identify possible risks and make decisions\n\nwell in time to avoid collision. If, on the other hand, satellite are very close, system\n\nreaction time could be longer than the time left before collision. But even in these\n\ncases, it should be considered that, for configurations with stable relative orbits,\n\nrelative velocities are smaller at shorter distances. Therefore, a-priori very conser-\n\nvative assumptions could be well beyond real risks.\n\nTable 15.4 Summary of expected distance behaviors\n\nTechnique Configuration Distance behavior\n\nCross track INSAR Cartwheel XTI Oscillating between 3 and 6 km\n\nDe XTI Oscillating between 3 and 6 km\nPendulum XTI Oscillating between 300 m and 2 km\n\nHelix XTI Oscillating between 1 and 2.5 km\n\nAlong track INSAR Cartwheel ATI Oscillating between 75 and 150 m\n\nDe ATI Oscillating between 75 and 150 m\nDo ATI Almost constant at about 150 m\nPendulum ATI Almost constant at about 75 m\n\nLarge baseline\n\nBSAR\n\nDrifting to BSAR (Phases 1\u20132) Oscillating between 500 m and 3.5 km\n\nDrifting to BSAR (Phases 3) Oscillating between 500 m and kilometers\n\nDrifting BSAR Oscillating between 10 and 250 km\n\nStatic BSAR Oscillating between 25 and 400 km\n\nTable 15.5 Preliminary definition of formation flying domains and requirements\n\nMinimum distance Formation flying domain Control requirement Measurement requirement\n\n<200 m Tight 1 m 1 cm\n\n<500 m Close 3 m 3 cm\n\n>500 m Fair 10 m 10 cm\n\n>10 km Loose 100 m 1 m\n\n>100 km Far 1 km 10 m\n\n468 A. Moccia et al.\n\n\n\nRather, orbits should undergone a finer selection process, after a first level\n\nincluding J2-only perturbations, to analyze effects of additional perturbations\n\nwhich could act as safety enhancer (or the other way round). As an example,\n\naerodynamic drag, which can be the main relative perturbation in case of satellites\n\nwith different ballistic coefficient, can be used as a design resource in the orbit\n\ndesign process. As an example, in the case of all large baseline orbit configurations,\n\nBISSAT satellite flies through orbit interceptions before COSMO. Thus, choosing\n\nBISSAT ballistic coefficient larger than COSMO one is safer since drag causes\n\nfaster decay and faster velocity: distance naturally tends to increase. The same\n\nconsiderations apply for pendulum orbital configurations.\n\nFor the orbit configurations which imply a perigee anomaly difference, the\n\ncombined effect of J2, J3 and drag perturbations should be analyzed. As an example,\n\nit must be considered that COSMO flies on a frozen orbit with (at a first approxi-\n\nmation) constant eccentricity vector (constant o and e). Thus, if BISSAT perigee\nanomaly is not 90?, its orbit will not be frozen. Since eccentricity decreases faster\nfor the satellite with worse ballistic coefficient due to the aerodynamics, J3 effect\n\nshould be selected in order to, even though partially, counteract drag effect. Thus,\n\nas an example if BISSAT has larger ballistic coefficient, drag produces a faster\n\n(with reference to COSMO) decreases of eccentricity which can be partially\n\ncompensated by having BISSAT perigee anomaly larger than 90? so that J3\nproduces an increase of eccentricity.\n\nThen, for the orbital configurations foreseeing a De, it would be desirable to have\na naturally increasing De (which leads to a naturally increasing separation). To this\nend, the satellite with worse ballistic coefficient must have the lower value of\n\neccentricity. Finally Helix XTI configuration bears similarities to both\n\nDe configuration and large baseline BSAR configuration.

Following\n\ninitial selection in the first part of the study, three candidates were analysed in\n\ndetail in Phase 2.

The output of the study was a definition of\n\nvarious small satellite missions and their required developments. The study was led\n\nby Astrium Ltd, with support from Astrium SAS, Astrium GmbH, ENVEO, GMV\n\nand Verhaert Space.1\n\nIn Phase 1 of this Definition Study, about 40 ideas for EO missions compatible\n\nwith implementation on a small satellite and which may benefit from formation\n\nflying were identified, assessed and traded off. This led to the selection of three\n\ncandidates to be studied further in Phase 2: the Topographic Levelling mission\n\n(TOPOLEV), a C-band PAssive RAdar Satellite(s) (C-PARAS) mission, and an\n\nAerosol Land Mission (AERL). As the AERL mission could also be performed\n\nwithout formation flying it is not further considered here.\n\nThe Topographic Levelling Mission (TOPOLEV) is aimed at mapping surface\n\ntopography and its temporal change at very high accuracy (less than 1 m in height)\n\nand high spatial resolution. The focus of the mission is on low and moderate relief\n\nterrain, including water surfaces. The mission concept applies single-pass SAR\n\ninterferometry with two satellites flying in close formation in a Cartwheel configu-\n\nration (see more details below). The active SAR (Master) operates on the main\n\nplatform, and the receive-only SAR (Slave) on the second satellite. Ku-band\n\n(13.6 GHz) was proposed as the SAR frequency because surface penetration (e.g.\n\nin snow, ice, dry soil, etc.) is reduced, and the backscatter signal of water and other\n\nsurfaces is higher compared to lower radar frequencies. At this frequency a rela-\n\ntively small antenna size can be used.\n\nC-PARAS is a variant on the TOPOLEV mission, being a free-flying formation\n\nof three small SAR spacecraft (with radar receiver only) flying in a Cartwheel\n\nconfiguration (see more details below) with each other and providing a bistatic SAR\n\nobservation capability at C-band in formation with GMES Sentinel-1 which\n\nprovides the scene illumination. Potential benefits of C-PARAS include acquisition\n\nof multiple interferograms in a single pass (overcoming problems of phase\n\nunwrapping in steep terrains), along-track and multi-baseline interferometry for\n\nocean current and forestry applications, and spatial resolution enhancement. Both\n\nfor this mission and TOPOLEV, key aspects are the need for very precise knowl-\n\nedge of the satellite locations, and accommodation of the radar antenna on small\n\nspacecraft.\n\nThe two missions are both designed for PROBA-class small spacecraft, with\n\nconventional platform equipments and structure as far as possible in order to\n\nminimise development costs and risk. The driver is accommodation of the rela-\n\ntively large, non-deployable SAR antenna which is fixed to the body of the\n\nspacecraft. Both missions have been designed to use the VEGA launch vehicle.\n\nTOPOLEV and C-PARAS are dual and triple spacecraft launches, respectively, and\n\nin both cases the large size of their fixed (non-deployable) SAR antenna means that\n\n1Now QinetiQ Space NV.\n\n474 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\nthe complete VEGA fairing volume is required to accommodate the spacecraft. The\n\ntwo missions both employ sun-synchronous orbits at altitudes between 600 and\n\n700 km, and inclinations of approximately 98?.\nThe two missions use Formation Flying because this provides the opportu-\n\nnity for single pass SAR interferometry, thus avoiding the temporal effects of\n\nscene de-correlation and changes in the atmospheric phase screen. The baseline\n\nin both cases is the interferometric Cartwheel, although other configurations\n\nare possible (e.g. the helix). The Cartwheel maximises cross-track separation\n\nwhen the along-track separation is a minimum. These are inertial or Keplerian\n\norbits set up in such a way that the relative motion of the spacecraft with\n\nrespect to each other forms a Cartwheel once per orbit. The Cartwheel offers\n\nperiodic across-track and along-track baseline viewing geometries suitable for\n\nthe science applications. Periodic manoeuvres are required to maintain the\n\nCartwheel formation, but this orbit control is open loop by ground station\n\ncommand.\n\nPrecise navigation information is required, in terms of the absolute position of\n\nthe spacecraft (accuracy of order 1 m) and their relative position (accuracy of\n\norder 1 mm, with an inter-satellite separation of order 100\u2013500 m). The accuracy\n\nof the baseline measurement between the spacecraft is a major driver for DEM\n\nquality. Both cross-track and radial components of the baseline vector must be\n\nmeasured accurately in order to reconstruct the viewing geometry (which means\n\nthat a pure inter-satellite ranging sensor is not sufficient). It is proposed to use\n\ndifferential GPS techniques for the baseline measurement. In this respect\n\nC-PARAS is slightly more favourable than TOPOLEV because the longer radar\n\nwavelength gives a proportional relaxation in accuracy for C-band compared to\n\nKu-band.\n\nAbsolute GPS measurements will be used for orbit determination, which can\n\nbe achieved with accuracy of the order of 5\u201310 cm. A validation of the precise\n\norbit determination done with laser ranging measurements can yield accuracies\n\nof the order of 3 cm. One of the spacecraft will be the reference and its orbit\n\nconsidered fixed. Using differential GPS measurements the orbit of the other\n\nspacecraft will be determined, enabling a precise reconstruction of the\n\nbaseline.\n\nGPS carrier phase and pseudo-range measurements collected onboard each of\n\nthe spacecraft will be downlinked and processed on the ground following a dedi-\n\ncated processing flow for the determination of the relative baseline. Based on\n\nprevious studies for the GRACE and TanDEM-X missions, it should be possible\n\nto obtain accuracies in the mm range as required.\n\nIt is to be noted that as yet neither the TOPOLEV nor C-PARAS mission has\n\nbeen selected for implementation, though further analysis of the C-PARAS mission\n\nhas been performed in the ongoing \u201cEarth Observation Sentinel Convoy\u201d study\n\n(Theme 1\u2014Ocean & Ice) that is being led for ESA by Astrium Ltd under contract\n\nAO/1-6146/09/NL/FC.\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 475\n\n\n\n16.2 TOPOLEV Mission\n\n16.2.1 Introduction\n\nThe Topographic Levelling Mission (TOPOLEV, Fig. 16.1) was originally pro-\n\nposed by ENVEO, and is aimed at mapping surface topography and its temporal\n\nchange at very high accuracy (less than 1 m in height) and high spatial resolution.\n\nThe focus of the mission is on low and moderate relief terrain, including water\n\nsurfaces.\n\nThere is high need of precise elevation data for a wide range of scientific and\n\noperational applications. The focus of the mission is on low and moderate relief\n\nterrain, including water surfaces. The main mission objectives are given below:\n\nPrimary Mission Objective\n\nStudying geophysical and environmental phenomena and processes that reveal\n\ntemporal changes in surface topography at time scales ranging from weeks to\n\nseasonal and annual changes. The main targets of interest include:\n\n\u2022 Measuring water level in lakes, rivers, and wetland areas.\n\n\u2022 Precise topographic mapping of floodplains and other alluvial terrain, and the\n\ntemporal changes caused by erosion and deposition processes (for applications\n\nin geoscience and hazards assessment).\n\n\u2022 Precise topographic mapping of inter-tidal zones and coastal wetlands (tide-\n\nland), and temporal changes caused by tidal action (erosion and deposition).\n\n\u2022 Measuring mass balance of glaciers, ice streams and ice caps.\n\nReference orbit\n\nP1\n\nI\n\nP2\n\nFig. 16.1 TOPOLEV mission configuration (LHS) and sketch of TOPOLEV Cartwheel orbit\n\nconfiguration with two satellites (RHS)\n\n476 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\n\u2022 Mapping geological structures.\n\n\u2022 Observation of surface topographic changes caused by subsidence or inflation\n\nphenomena (volcanism, mining, karst erosion, permafrost, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Measuring the height of vegetation.\n\nThese applications require on the one hand the production of very accurate\n\ntopographic base maps, and on the other hand the measurement of temporal\n\nchanges in topography.\n\nSecondary Mission Objective\n\n\u2022 The retrieval of very accurate digital elevation data, with emphasis on low or\n\nmoderate relief terrain, in order to fill gaps or improve digital elevation data from\n\nother data sources (e.g. SRTM, TanDEM-X, SPOT stereo, etc.).\n\nIn addition, the mission has the objective of advancing and demonstrating coordi-\n\nnated, close formation flying technology.\n\nTOPOLEV will be complementary to the TanDEM-X mission, launched in June\n\n2010. TanDEM-X, operating in formation with TerraSAR-X, will provide high accu-\n\nracy DEM data aimed at full coverage of global land surfaces within 3 years of\n\noperation [3]. In addition, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X address many other\n\nobjectives, based on the capability of the system to operate in many different modes.\n\nIn view of the need for precise repeat topographic data for a wide range of applications,\n\nthere are many tasks to be fulfilled by a dedicated topographic mapping mission such\n\nas TOPOLEV, complementary and as follow-on to the measurements of TanDEM-X.\n\nThe mission concept applies single-pass SAR interferometry with two satellites\n\nflying in close formation in a Cartwheel configuration. The active SAR (Master)\n\noperates in Stripmap mode, and a receive-only SAR (Slave) on the second satellite\n\n(note that for redundancy purposes, and to maintain the same ballistic coefficient, the\n\nsecond satellite will also have a transmit capability). Ku-band (13.6GHz) is proposed\n\nas the SAR frequency because surface penetration (e.g. in snow, ice, dry soil, etc.) is\n\nreduced, and the backscatter signal of water and other surfaces is higher compared to\n\nlower radar frequencies. At this frequency a relatively small antenna size can be used.\n\nHigher backscattering at water surfaces and swamps is also the driver for the\n\nselection of VV polarisation. Atmospheric effects at Ku-band are higher than at\n\nX-band but are still sufficiently small. Signal degradation is expected in areas of\n\nheavy rain, which will be excluded in the processing of the DEMs.\n\n16.2.2 Requirements Analysis\n\nThe mission priority is on measurements of high precision topographic data over\n\nlow and moderate relief terrain, and its temporal changes, for applications in\n\ngeoscience and environmental monitoring. It is also planned to measure the water\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 477\n\n\n\nlevel in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands. These applications require very\n\nprecise measurement of surface topography. The spatial raster in (X, Y) depends\n\non the target, with a typical range of 25 m for alluvial planes, erosion zones,\n\nvolcanic zones, small glaciers, etc. (Category 1 in Table 16.1) versus about 50 m\n\nfor wetlands, lakes, large ice streams, etc. (Category 2).\n\nAs a general geodetic product, the aim is to match the Digital Terrain Elevation\n\nData, Level 3 (DTED-3) specifications. These require rather high resolution in (X,\n\nY) (12 m), but have relaxed requirements for vertical resolution compared to\n\ngeoscience. For geophysical and hydrological applications the vertical accuracy is\n\nmore important, whereas the horizontal spacing can be scaled down. DTED-3 refers\n\nmainly to military and commercial applications (including man-made targets),\n\nwhere high spatial resolution is very important.\n\nThe swath width requirements are driven by the dimensions of the phenomena to\n\nbe studied and also by the data with which the DEM products are combined.\n\nA typical minimum swath width for this type of products is 20 km (the target is\n\n?30 km).\nBecause for most of the targets under consideration the surface elevation\n\nchanges very slowly in time, coverage of large areas can be achieved through\n\nsequential orbits. For survey of water bodies a sampling strategy needs to be\n\ndefined.\n\nTwo orbit phases (sun-synchronous, dawn/dusk orbits) are proposed:\n\n1. Global Levelling phase (GL-Phase): 91 day repeat orbit (1,394 tracks) enabling\n\nnear global access to land areas at seasonal intervals. This orbit corresponds to\n\nthe ICESat orbit, thus enabling validation and improvement of the absolute\n\nTable 16.1 Requirements for geoscience and for topographic base maps (DTED-3)\n\nParameter Specification Requirement\n\nGeoscience&elevation change\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 25 m (Category 1); 50 m (Category 2)\n\nRelative vertical\n\naccuracy\n\n?1.0 m minimum; ?0.5 m target\n(for slope < 20%)\n\nSwath width Across-track, km 25 km (minimum), 30 km (target)\n\nDTED-3\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 12 m (0.3333 arc sec)\n\nAbsolute horizontal\n\naccuracy\n\n90% circular error <10 m\n\nRelative horizontal\n\naccuracy\n\n90% circular error <3 m\n\nAbsolute vertical\n\naccuracy\n\n90% linear error <10 m\n\nRelative vertical\n\naccuracy\n\n90% linear point-to-point\n\nerror over 1 ? 1?\n<2 m (for slope < 20%)\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 25 m\n\nRelative vertical\n\naccuracy\n\n?1.0 m minimum; ?0.5 m target\n(for slope < 20%)\n\n478 T.

The primary aim of this mode is to map seasonal or annual\n\nchanges of surface height, e.g. for glaciers, river plains, wetlands, inter-tidal\n\nzones, etc. In addition, it can contribute to filling gaps in the global DEM.\n\n2. Hydrology and geophysical process studies (HP-Phase): 15 day repeat orbit to\n\nstudy specific geophysical and hydrological phenomena with higher temporal\n\naccuracy (these are mainly processes related to water and ice). This orbit provides\n\nonly partial coverage of the global land surfaces. A sampling strategy needs to be\n\ndeveloped to obtain relevant statistics for various climate zones and regions.\n\nOrbit and sensor specifications for the TOPOLEV mission are given in\n\nTables 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4.\n\nThe optimum perpendicular baseline requirements for bistatic SAR geometry\n\ndepend on the topography. For Level and Moderate Topography (priority objective\n\nof the mission) an inter-satellite distance matching the following baseline is\n\nproposed:\n\n\u2022 Perpendicular Baseline (Across-track) 400 m\u00b1100 m.\n\nThe main latitude band for achieving this baseline is:\n\n\u2022 Land areas between 45? and 65?N.\n\nTable 16.2 Proposed orbit specifications for the TOPOLEV mission\n\nOrbit parameters Orbit phase GL Orbit phase HP\n\nAltitude 600 km 628 km\n\nInclination (deg.) 97.8 sun-synchronous 97.9 sun-synchronous\n\nRepeat cycle 91 days 15 days\n\nCoverage Near global access Subset of land surfaces\n\nTable 16.3 Selected orbit for studying the technical concept of TOPOLEV\n\nOrbit parameters Orbit phase HP\n\nAltitude 628 km\n\nInclination (deg) ca. 98?, sun-synchronous\nRepeat cycle 15 days\n\nCoverage Subset of land surfaces\n\nTable 16.4 TOPOLEV sensor specifications\n\nParameter Selected\n\nCentre frequency Ku-band (13.6 GHz)\n\nPolarisation VV\n\nNESZ ?\u201320 dB (Ku-band)\nOperation mode Stripmap\n\nNominal swath width ?25 km (30 km goal)\nIncidence angle at swath centre 25?\u201335?

The TOPOLEV formation design parameters are given in Table 16.5.\n\nThe viewing and baseline geometry between the \u201chub\u201d spacecraft and \u201crim\u201d\n\nspacecraft is shown in Fig. 16.2.\n\nThe Cartwheel plane intersects the (X,Y) plane along X, and makes an angle a to\nthe (X,Z) plane. Bp and Bn are the parallel and perpendicular components of the\n\nbaseline B, and ? is the look direction. The wheel radius is chosen as a consequence\nof the orbital parameters so that the perpendicular baseline Bn lies within the\n\ndesired range during the period when the angle ? sweeps through the range of\nvalues about 90? when the constellation is over the particular latitude of interest.\n\nNominally the look angle is chosen to be 30?, which then allows a pure\nCartwheel type of formation. The out-of-orbit plane separation (BZ in Fig. 16.2)\n\ncan be calculated, depending on the chosen Cartwheel size. The separation varies\n\nwith the angle from the intersection of the reference plane and the satellite\u2019s orbit\n\nplane. Where the planes intersect, the maximum cross-track separation is zero. It is\n\nthen at a maximum when the satellite is at 90? true anomaly from that point. In this\ncontext, the reference plane is the plane of the \u201chub\u201d of the formation.\n\nTable 16.5 TOPOLEV requirements and baseline\n\nParameter Value Comment\n\nNumber of spacecraft 2 Spacecraft are similar with\n\nthe same ballistic coefficients\n\nFormation type Cartwheel Formation shape is maintained\n\nby periodic manoeuvres\n\n(typically one per several days)\nRadius of cartwheel:\n\n500 m\n\nAngle between formation\n\nplane and local\n\nhorizontal (a)\n\n30?

Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\nThe location of the planes intersection can be chosen freely (i.e. at any orbit\n\nlongitude). For a sun-synchronous orbit, this means the intersection can be at any\n\nlatitude between approximately ?82? and +82?.\nThe baseline perpendicular to the reference plane is between 300 and 500 m.\n\nFigure 16.3 shows that this baseline can be achieved with a Cartwheel radius of\n\n500 m, over a range of angles between approximately 40? and 140?. If a larger\nradius Cartwheel is selected then the angular range covered is reduced. Choosing\n\nthe best case allows the reference plane and satellite orbit plane intersections\n\nto be placed at the equator. The required out-of-plane separations are then\n\nachieved from latitudes 40? up to a maximum of 82?, and then descending to\n40? again.\n\nNote that the Cartwheel rather than helix orbit has been chosen because of the\n\nrequirement for the primary DEM application to have minimum along-track sepa-\n\nration when the cross-track baseline is maximised (unlike the helix where the\n\nmaximum cross-track separation occurs when the along-track separation is also at\n\na maximum). Figure 16.4 shows the case for two spacecraft and the relative motion\n\nof the \u201crim\u201d spacecraft w.r.t. the \u201chub\u201d spacecraft. The motion in the (X,Y) plane is\n\nalways an ellipse, with amplitude in X (along-track) twice the amplitude in Y\n\n(radial). The Cartwheel and helix formations are then distinguished by the phasing\n\nof the cross-track and along-track motions.\n\nB\nZ (cross track)\n\nBz\n\nBx\n\nBy\nHub\nS/C\n\nRim\nS/C\n\nY (radial)\n\nX (along track)\n\nnadir\n\nLook direction\n\nBp\n\nBn\n\nslant range R\n\nsatellite height H\n\n?H = topographic height\nabove reference surface\n\nB\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nFig. 16.2 Viewing geometry showing concept of cross-track baseline requirement\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 481\n\n\n\n5 15 25 35 45 55 65 75 85 95 10\n5\n\n11\n5\n\n12\n5\n\n13\n5\n\n14\n5\n\n15\n5\n\n16\n5\n\n17\n5\n\n300\n\n340\n\n380\n\n420\n\n460\n\n500\n\n540\n\n580\n\n620\n\n660\n\n700\n\n740\n\n780\n\n820\n\n860\n\n900\n\n940\n\n980\n\nangle (deg)\n\nF\norm\n\nation m\nax separtion (m\n\n)\n\n480-500\n\n460-480\n\n440-460\n\n420-440\n\n400-420\n\n380-400\n\n360-380\n\n340-360\n\n320-340\n\n300-320\n\n280-300\n\n260-280\n\n240-260\n\n220-240\n\n200-220\n\n180-200\n\n160-180\n\n140-160\n\n120-140\n\n100-120\n\n80-100\n\n60-80\n\n40-60\n\n20-40\n\n0-20\n\nFig. 16.3 Displacement perpendicular to the reference plane (contours) as a function of angle\n\nfrom the reference plane (hub orbit plane) and satellite orbit intersection and the radius of the\n\nselected Cartwheel formation (vertical axis)\n\nHorizontal projection\n\nCross Track (m)\n\nA\nlo\n\nng\n T\n\nra\nck\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\nHorizontal projection\n\n\u2013250\n\n\u2013200\n\n\u2013150\n\n\u2013100\n\n\u201350\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n\u2013250\n\n\u2013200\n\n\u2013150\n\n\u2013100\n\n\u201350\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n\u2013200 \u2013100 0 100 200\u2013200 \u2013100 0 100 200\n\nCross Track (m)\n\nA\nlo\n\nng\n T\n\nra\nck\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n\u2013150\nAlong track (m)\n\nV\ner\n\ntic\nal\n\n (\nm\n\n)\nV\n\ner\ntic\n\nal\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nV\ner\n\ntic\nal\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\n\u2013100\n\u201350\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n\n\u2013300 \u2013200 \u2013100 0 100 200 300\n\n\u2013200\n\n\u2013100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nCross track (m)\n\nReference (hub)\nspacecraft\n\nY (in orbit plane perpendicular\nto X axis)\n\nX (in direction of motion)\n\nZ (out of orbit plane)\n\nCross track (m)\n\n\u2013200 \u2013100 0 100 200\n\ncartwheel\ncartwheel\n\nhelix\n\nhelix\n\n\u2013200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n\u2013100\u2013200 \u2013100 100 200\n\nFig. 16.4 Cartwheel and helix motions\n\n482 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Analysis of Payload and Payload Performance\n\n16.2.4.1 SAR Payload\n\nThe SAR instrument for TOPOLEV is a single-polarisation Synthetic Aperture\n\nRadar (SAR). The instrument is divided into the following subsystems:\n\n\u2022 Antenna, with slotted waveguide radiators (vertical polarisation), cross-feeder\n\nand distribution network.\n\n\u2022 RF Front-End with Rx/Tx circulator, calibration network, synchronisation horns\n\nand fixation, Transmit Receive Module (TRM) for synchronisation horns, and\n\n1:6 switch for the synchronisation horns.\n\n\u2022 HPA with TWT and Electronic Power Conditioner (EPC).\n\n\u2022 RF Electronics and Central Electronics with up- and down-converter, frequency\n\nand chirp generator, LNA and limiter, ADCs, local oscillator, and instrument\n\nand timing control.\n\n\u2022 GPS receiver and antenna with GPS receiver box, GPS antenna, and external\n\nLNA.\n\n\u2022 Solid state mass memory.\n\nThe synchronisation horns required for the phase referencing among the\n\nsatellites are part of the RF front-end subsystem. All of the RF equipment must\n\nbe kept at a stable temperature, especially the local oscillator.\n\n16.2.4.2 Preliminary SAR Antenna Layout and Budgets\n\nThe instruments are based on long and narrow slotted waveguide antennas (5.4\n\n0.54 m). To avoid highly complex folding mechanisms a fixed antenna configura-\n\ntion is proposed. This allows for dual launch of the two satellites in a single VEGA\n\nlauncher.\n\nThe TOPOLEV SAR antenna will be a passive slotted waveguide antenna\n\n(comparable with the ERS-1 SAR antenna). It will consist of eight identical panels\n\nassembled in one row. Each panel will be built by 35 slotted waveguides arranged\n\nas 1 column. Each slotted waveguide will have 44 slots (\u201cdisplaced shunt slots\u201d). It\n\nwill be centre-fed and of the resonant type. To achieve the necessary surface\n\naccuracy (<\u00b10.5 mm) a CFRP design will be necessary. The antenna has to be\n\nmounted fixed on the spacecraft (Fig. 16.5).\n\nA summary of the TOPOLEV payload characteristics is given in Table 16.6.\n\n16.2.4.3 Redundancy Philosophy\n\nFor the TOPOLEV payload no internal redundancies are foreseen. In case of a\n\nfailure in the transmit path of a satellite, however, inherent redundancy exists due to\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 483\n\n\n\nthe presence of the other (identical) satellite. The transmit part can be shifted to the\n\nother satellite without impairing the mission goals.\n\n16.2.4.4 Phase Referencing\n\nFor interferometric SAR, the relative phase drift between the two free-running\n\noscillators of the instruments has to be compensated in order to keep the coherence\n\nwithin reasonable limits (Fig. 16.6). As a consequence, the pulse repetition intervals\n\n(PRIs) are not simultaneous and some measurement data is not available for\n\ninterferometric processing (Fig. 16.7).\n\nFor TOPOLEV, a phase referencing is proposed between the two satellites (as\n\ndone for the TanDEM-X mission). The two satellites will be equipped with six horn\n\nantennas each, allowing the transmission and reception of reference signals.

Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\nhorn antennas will provide near omni-directional coverage, but only the horn that is\n\nlooking towards the tandem satellite is activated through a switch matrix.\n\nFor a bistatic interferometric SAR configuration, one satellite transmits and both\n\nreceive. In regular intervals pulses (5\u201310 pulses per second) dedicated to phase\n\nreferencing are exchanged and it is possible to synchronise both phase and PRI\n\ntiming for offline on-ground processing.\n\nThe reference pulses are the same chirp signals that are used for SAR operation.\n\nAs the power of the HPA is too much for the short distance, the chirp signal is taken\n\nfrom before the HPA and amplified in a dedicated Transmit and Receive Module\n\n(TRM). The output power will be about 5 W. For TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X a phase\n\naccuracy of 10? has been achieved. Because of the higher frequency for TOPOLEV\na reduced accuracy of 15? is expected.\n\n16.2.4.5 Inter-Satellite Distance Measurements\n\nFor the required high-accuracy baseline determination, a dual-frequency GPS\n\nreceiver will be used. The GPS receiver consists of a receiver box, a GPS antenna\n\nand a small external LNA. TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X experience has indicated that\n\nthe required baseline accuracy of 1 mm can be achieved on-ground by fitting the\n\nGPS measurements to a highly complex orbit model.\n\nTwo qualities of baseline determination are available:\n\n\u2022 Rapid baseline determination (for quick assessments): Available a few hours\n\nafter the data-take.\n\nFig. 16.6 Drift of Local Oscillator (LO) frequencies lead to an offset in the timing\n\nFig. 16.7 By non-synchronous timing measurement data is lost\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 485\n\n\n\n\u2022 Precise orbit determination (for full accuracy): Only available from up to a\n\nmonth after the data-take.\n\nFor the high-accuracy orbit it is necessary to collect orbital data over a long time\n\nrange and to average over a range of perturbation effects.\n\n16.2.4.6 TOPOLEV Instrument Performance\n\nThe SAR imaging requirements are fulfilled by the TOPOLEV instruments. The\n\naccuracy of the relative height measurements meets the requirements in most cases.\n\nHeight measurement over soil and rock ground is a typical example for a surface\n\nwith no (or very low) volume de-correlation. This results in the coherence budget\n\nshown in Table 16.7, with minimum coherence above 0.8 even in the worst case.\n\nFurther model parameters are listed in Table 16.8 together with the resulting\n\nrelative height error.\n\nTable 16.7 Coherence assessment over soil and rock\n\nBeam 1 Beam 2 Remark\n\nSNR 0.856\u20130.905 0.849\u20130.904 (across the swath)\n\nQuantisation 0.995 0.995\n\nRange and azimuth ambiguity 0.995 0.993\n\nCoregistration azimuth 0.984 0.984 (assumption, 10%\n\nco-registration error)\n\nCoregistration range 0.984 0.984 (assumption, 10%\n\nco-registration error)\n\nVolume de-correlation 1.000 1.000 (at 31? angle of incidence;\n3.0 dB/m assumed)\n\nTemporal de-correlation 1.000 1.000\n\nProcessing loss 0.985 0.985 (Tandem-X)\n\nTotal coherence 0.816\u20130.856 0.808\u20130.856\n\nTable 16.8 Assessment of relative height error over soil and rock, no slope\n\nBeam 1 Beam 2 Remark\n\nHeight of ambiguity (m) 12 12\n\nPost spacing (m ? m) 25 ? 25 25 ? 25\nArea post spacing 625 625\n\nMulti-looks 41.4 41.4\n\nInstrument contribution\n\nto phase error (deg)\n\n15 15 Assumption, 90% confidence\n\nRelative height error (m) 0.25\u20130.33 0.25\u20130.40 Without contribution\n\nof baseline error\n\nRMS baseline error (mm) 1.0 1.0\n\nContribution to relative\n\nheight error (m)\n\n0.89 0.89 90% confidence\n\nTotal relative height error (m) 0.89\u20130.95 0.89\u20130.98 With contribution of baseline\n\nerror\n\n486 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\nThe relative height error that results from instrument internal phase errors\n\n(especially the non perfect synchronisation of the two radars), the signal-to-noise\n\nratio and the de-correlation effect stays below 0.33 m inside the nominal 25 km\n\nswath, and grows in the worst case up to 0.4 m at the edges of the extended (goal)\n\n30 km swath. But this error is dominated by the impact of the 1 mm baseline\n\nknowledge uncertainty which finally gives a total relative height error below but\n\nclose to 1 m (cf. Fig. 16.8).\n\nFor terrain with 20% slope the performance is slightly degraded (Fig. 16.9) but\n\nstill below 1.01 m inside a 25 km swath and below 1.06 m inside a 30 km swath.\n\nBoth results are very close to the 1 m requirement.\n\nFor some cases, however, such as water surfaces in combination with low wind\n\n(2 m/s), the relative height error reaches 1.25 m in the nominal swath width (25 km)\n\nand even 1.5 m in the extended swath (30 km), against the requirement of 1 m\n\nrelative height accuracy.\n\n16.2.5 Mission Performance\n\nInvestigations performed on some typical scenarios indicate the feasibility of\n\nachieving the main TOPOLEV mission goal in generating digital elevation models\n\nwith high accuracy. Based on the SAR design and its sensitivity, the interferometric\n\nperformance has been studied assuming backscatter properties of bare soil and rock,\n\nand taking various error sources (including baseline uncertainty) into account.\n\nThe 90% point-to-point error was estimated for two proposed DEM products,\n\nRelative Height Error of DEM (90% point-to-point)\n\n0,20\n\n0,30\n\n0,40\n\n0,50\n\n0,60\n\n0,70\n\n0,80\n\n0,90\n\n1,00\n\n1,10\n\n1,20\n\n30,0 30,5 31,0 31,5 32,0 32,5\n\nIncidence Angle [deg]\n\nR\nel\n\n.

The only part which needs a\n\nnew development is the slotted waveguide radar antenna. Here it should be\n\ninvestigated if manufacturing in aluminium would be sufficient (from the thermal\n\nstability point of view) or if CFRP technology would be needed.\n\n16.2.7 Summary and Exploitation\n\nTopographic data represent basic information of fundamental importance for a\n\nvariety of geo-information systems, human security, infrastructure planning, as\n\nwell as for modelling and understanding Earth processes. For most parts of the\n\nworld, high accuracy DEMs as would be provided by TOPOLEV are not available.\n\nIn this respect, TOPOLEV would be able to play an important role in filling the data\n\ngaps. However, the main driver for TOPOLEV is the delivery of precise topo-\n\ngraphic information and its change in time to improve the knowledge on Earth\n\nSystem processes.\n\nFor many topics in Earth System Science, reliable and up-to-date data on Earth\n\nsurface topography is needed. Various international initiatives and programmes\n\n(e.g. GEOSS, IGOS, Earth Observation Summit, GMES) have stressed the need for\n\nup-to-date, consistent, accurate, high resolution DEM data that are available to the\n\nscience community without restrictions. TOPOLEV, being dedicated to topo-\n\ngraphic mapping with high precision, would be able to fulfil a significant part of\n\nthese needs.\n\nTable 16.9 summarizes the main available global DEM data sets. GTOPO30, a\n\nlow resolution data set with ca. 1,000 m pixel size based on various sources of\n\nelevation data, is a global data set.\n\nThese available data sets are well below the spatial and accuracy requirements of\n\nmany applications.\n\nGTOPO30, SRTM and ASTER-G are single data sets, and do not allow to map\n\nelevation changes over time. Combining 2 of these data sets (e.g. SRTM and\n\nASTER-G) to study elevation changes results in even larger errors than for a\n\nsingle data set, rendering it useless for most applications. The TOPOLEV DEM\n\nproducts have several advantages over these data sets, including higher vertical\n\naccuracy, improved spatial resolution, and the repeat observations capability,\n\nenabling the precise mapping of elevation changes in time. In the proposed two\n\norbit configurations, TOPOLEV monitors a subset of land surfaces with a repeat\n\ninterval of 15 days in the Geoscience Phase and has complete access to the land\nsurfaces (except the polar gap) within 91 days in the Global Levelling Phase.\nBoth phases offer the option of repeat observation for measuring topographic\n\nchanges.\n\n490 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\n16.2.7.1 DEM-GEODETIC Product\n\nThe DEM-GEODETIC product is dedicated to operational (e.g. construction\n\nactivities) and scientific applications where high resolution topographic data are\n\nneeded. The product is characterized by a pixel size of 12 m and a vertical relative\n\n90% point-to-point height accuracy of 1.55 m in level and sloping terrain (up to\n\nslope angles <20?). The accuracy decreases gradually towards steep terrain. The\nproduct matches the requirements of the DTED-3 specifications. With the same\n\nspatial resolution the vertical height error can be further reduced by combining\n\nrepeat-pass products, e.g. using two interferometric data sets reduces the height\n\nerror to less than 1 m. The DEM-GEODETIC product will be of significant interest\n\nfor geotechnical work, planning of infrastructure such as traffic routes and hydro-\n\npower reservoirs in remote areas, hazard zonation, etc. The product is also of\n\ninterest for geoscience.

The resolution of\n\nthis product is 25 m, and it has a vertical relative 90% point-to-point height\n\naccuracy of better than 1 m in level and moderate terrain (up to slope angles\n\n<20?), with the accuracy gradually decreasing towards steep terrain.

The Geoscience Phase will provide 15 days\n\nrepeat observations of a subset of the land surfaces. This frequent repeat capability\n\nis of interest to studying geophysical and hydrological phenomena that are subject\n\nto high temporal change. These are mainly processes related to water and ice (lake\n\nlevels, wetlands). The 91 day repeat orbit addresses the observation of seasonal or\n\nannual changes of surface height, e.g. for glaciers and ice streams, river plains,\n\ninter-tidal zones, volcanic areas, erosional features, etc.\n\n16.3 C-PARAS Mission\n\n16.3.1 Introduction\n\nC-PARAS is another mission for precise topographic mapping, being a free-flying\n\nformation of three small SAR spacecraft (with radar receiver only) flying in a\n\nCartwheel configuration with each other and providing a bistatic SAR observation\n\ncapability at C-band in formation with Sentinel-1 which provides the scene illumi-\n\nnation. Potential benefits of C-PARAS include acquisition of multiple\n\ninterferograms in a single pass (overcoming problems of phase unwrapping in\n\nsteep terrains), along-track and multi-baseline interferometry for ocean current\n\nand forestry applications, and spatial resolution enhancement.\n\nThe principal objectives of the C-PARAS mission are:\n\n\u2022 Production of basic topographic maps (DEMs), in order to fill gaps and improve\n\navailable global DEMs (by applying single-pass, multi-baseline interferometry).\n\n\u2022 Precise mapping of elevation changes by means of precision DEMs produced at\n\nrepeat intervals of weeks to years for geoscience applications, e.g. volcanic and\n\ngeological structures, floodplains, wetlands, tidal zones, glaciers (by applying\n\nsingle-pass, multi-baseline interferometry).\n\n\u2022 Estimation of forest parameters by means of multi-baseline interferometry\n\n(tomography and/or PolInSAR techniques).\n\n\u2022 Observations of motion of ocean currents and fast moving sea-ice drift using\n\nalong-track interferometry.\n\n492 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\n\u2022 Generation of very high resolution SAR image products for mapping and\n\ngeoscience applications, applying across-track and/or along-track resolution\n\nenhancement.\n\n\u2022 Improvement of SAR image products of man-made structures (that are rich in\n\ncorner reflectors and specular reflectors) through exploitation of bi-static\n\nreflectance.\n\nIn the C-PARAS formation, the hub SC1 follows the orbit of Sentinel-1 at an\n\nalong-track separation of ~150 km and the two \u201cwheel\u201d spacecraft SC2 and SC3\n\norbit the hub at radii of 120 and 480 m, respectively (cf. Fig. 16.12). The distance of\n\n150 km from Sentinel-1 ensures good separation at the C-PARAS receivers of the\n\nnadir and wanted echoes from the Sentinel-1 illuminations, but exceeds the critical\n\nbaseline for interferometric SAR imagery (the images are completely uncorrelated)\n\nso only C-PARAS SAR image pairs can be used for interferometric products. The\n\nthree spacecraft perform periodic propulsive manoeuvres to maintain both the\n\nformation and its along-track position with respect to Sentinel-1.\n\nSince the Sentinel-1 space segment is non-cooperative (by design), the option of\n\nusing a two-way synchronisation link is precluded, and other means have to be used\n\nto establish system coherence. The separate USOs, although nominally at the same\n\nfrequency, will inevitably suffer from frequency drifts and will have different\n\nrandom phase noise. It is assumed, however, that the Sentinel-1 datation and\n\nradar database information will be available for C-PARAS.\n\n16.3.2 Requirements Analysis\n\nIn Table 16.10, the observation requirements are listed for the main applications.\n\nThe DTED-2 mapping requirements are relevant for producing DEMs over large\n\nareas for which data gaps exist in the global DEM (e.g. regions north of 60?Nwhich\n\nSC1: hub\nSC2 inner rim\n\nSC3 outer rim\n\ncross track\n\nradial\n\n69\n40\n\nsr\n-p\n\nalong track\n\na = 30\u00b0\n\n100\u2019s of m\n\n100\u2019s o\nf km\n\nSentinel 1\n\nFig. 16.12 C-PARAS concept of operation and Cartwheel orbit configuration\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 493\n\n\n\nwere not mapped by SRTM). DTED-3 is the mapping standard for high spatial\n\nresolution products. The requirements are demanding but should be achievable with\n\nC-PARAS by applying Sentinel-1 Stripmap mode as master and applying multi-\n\nbaseline techniques. The geoscience applications require very high vertical accu-\n\nracy (relative), whereas the spatial requirement is relaxed compared to DTED-3.\n\nThe accuracy requirements for measurements of ocean currents and of sea-ice\n\nare rather demanding. Typical drift velocities for sea-ice are ?1 m/s. Ocean\ncurrents may reach higher velocities, in particular in regions with strong tidal\n\ncurrents. This means that the requirements should be adjusted to the phenomena\n\nto be observed.\n\nThe general orbit parameters of C-PARAS are determined by the orbit of\n\nSentinel-1, which is specified in Table 16.11.\n\nAs the C-PARAS satellites would not be allowed to operate in close distance to\n\nSentinel-1 due to the danger of collision, a minimum distance of 50 km along-track\n\nfrom Sentinel-1 is imposed.\n\nTable 16.10 Observation requirements for geoscience and geodetic applications\n\nParameter Specification Requirement/Comment\n\nTopographic base map\n\nLarge-scale product DTED-2\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 30 m (1 arc sec at Earth centre)\n\nAbsolute horizontal accuracy 90% circular error <23 m\n\nAbsolute vertical accuracy 90% linear error <18 m (<10 m goal)\n\nRelative vertical accuracy 90% linear point-to-point\n\nerror over 1? ? 1?\n<12 m (for slope < 20%)\n\n(<5 m goal)\n\n<15 m (for slope > 20%)\n(<10 m goal)\n\nDTED-3\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 12 m (0.33 arc sec at Earth centre)\n\nAbsolute horizontal accuracy 90% circular error <10 m\n\nRelative horizontal accuracy 90% circular error <3 m\n\nAbsolute vertical accuracy 90% linear error <10 m\n\nRelative vertical accuracy 90% linear point-to-point\n\nerror over 1? ? 1?\n<2 m (for slope < 20%)\n\nElevation change\u2014Geoscience\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 25\u201350 m\n\nRelative vertical accuracy ?1.0 m (for slope < 20%)\n?3.0 m (for slope < 20%)\n\nOcean currents\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 100 m\n\nVelocity Standard deviation ?0.2 m/s\nSea-ice drift (fast moving)\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 50 m\n\nVelocity Standard deviation ?0.1 m/s\nForest parameters\n\nSpatial resolution Independent pixels 25 m\n\nTree height Standard deviation ?2 m or ?10% for h > 20 m\n\n494 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\nThe use of two instead of three receiving-only satellites (at far along-track\n\ndistance to Sentinel-1) would enable the formation of one bistatic single-track\n\ninterferogram with the baseline determined by the position of the two passive\n\nsatellites. This causes some reduction of the quality of DEMs as no multi-baseline\n\nprocessing is possible. However, it is an option that would nevertheless still be useful.\n\nThe proposed characteristics of the C-PARAS receivers are given in\n\nTable 16.12.\n\nThe baseline requirements for bistatic SAR geometry for the primary (across-\n\ntrack) applications are:\n\n\u2022 Perpendicular baseline (across-track) of three image pairs: 150, 450, 600 m\n\n(\u00b130%).\n\n\u2022 Along-track distance between receiving-only satellites should be as close as\n\npossible to increase coherence and minimize Doppler shift of azimuth spectrum.\n\n\u2022 The main latitude band for achieving this baseline is land areas between 45? and\n65?N.\n\n16.3.3 Mission and System Analysis\n\nC-PARAS is a constellation of three passive small S/C, flying about 150 km behind\n\nSentinel-1 and forming SAR images from the echoes of the Sentinel-1 transmissions\n\n(Table 16.13).\n\nTable 16.11 Sentinel-1 orbit specification\n\nOrbit parameters Sentinel-1 orbit specification\n\nAltitude ca. 700 km\n\nType Near-polar sun-synchronous\n\nInclination (deg.) 98.183402?\n\nRepeat cycle 12 days\n\nMean local solar time at ascending node 18:00 h (nominal)\n\nCoverage Global access\n\nTable 16.12 C-PARAS sensor specifications\n\nParameter Value\n\nCentre frequency 5.405 GHz\n\nSAR mode Receiving only\n\nBandwidth Synchronized with Sentinel-1\n\nPolarisation Co-pol (VV or HH)\n\nNoise Equivalent Sigma Zero NESZ ?23 dB\nSwath width ?50 km (receiving signal of Sentinel-1 Stripmap\n\nor Interferometric Wide swath Mode)\n\nUse of Sentinel-1 Modesa Interferometric wide swath mode\n\nMinimum requirement: swath IW1\n\nTarget: selectable IW modes (IW1, IW2, IW3)\naWith IW1 global access is not feasible, which is a major restriction for science and applications.\n\nThis minimum requirement is suitable for technological in-orbit demonstration\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 495\n\n\n\nThe out-of-orbit plane separation can be calculated, depending on the chosen\n\nCartwheel sizes for C-PARAS. In fact two, concentric Cartwheels can be chosen,\n\nwith the satellites located along a \u201cspoke\u201d of the wheel.\n\nAs for TOPOLEV, the location of the intersection of the reference and satellite\n\norbit planes can be chosen freely (i.e. at any orbit longitude). For a sun-synchronous\n\norbit, this means the intersection can be at any latitude between approximately ?82?\nand +82?.\n\nTable 16.13 C-PARAS requirements and baseline\n\nParameter Value Comment\n\nNumber of spacecraft 3 Spacecraft are identical (but very\n\ndifferent from Sentinel-1)\n\nSentinel-1 orbit altitude 693 km 3-SC constellation follows along\n\nthe track of Sentinel-1, trailing\n\nby 150 km\n\nSentinel-1 inclination 98?

Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\nIn this context the reference plane is the plane of the \u201chub\u201d of the formation. The\n\nbaseline perpendicular to the reference plane is then:\n\n\u2022 Between 70 and 130 m for the centre to inner spacecraft, this baseline can be\n\nachieved with a Cartwheel radius of 130 m, over a range of angles between\n\napproximately 35? and 145?.\n\u2022 Between 210 and 390 m for the inner to outer spacecraft, this baseline can be\n\nachieved with a Cartwheel radius of 390 m (for outer spacecraft relative to inner\n\nspacecraft), over a range of angles between approximately 35? and 145?.\n\u2022 Between 280 and 520 m for the centre to outer spacecraft, this baseline can be\n\nachieved with a Cartwheel radius of 520 m, over a range of angles between\n\napproximately 35? and 145?.\n\nIf a larger radius Cartwheel is selected then the angular range covered is reduced.\n\nChoosing the best case allows the reference and satellite orbit intersections to be\n\nplaced at the equator. The required out-of-plane separations are then achieved from\n\nlatitudes 35? up to a maximum of 82?, and then descending to 35? again.\n\n16.3.3.1 Orbit Control Relative to Sentinel-1\n\nSentinel-1 and the C-PARAS spacecraft will have different Area/Mass values. The\n\nC-PARAS formation is designed to follow Sentinel-1 at an along-track distance of\n\ntypically 150 km. Differential drag effects will cause the whole formation to drift\n\nwith respect to Sentinel-1. Sentinel-1 will periodically perform station-keeping\n\nmanoeuvres to maintain its mean semi-major axis. This could be intervals of\n\ntypically 2 days and is driven by the control band requirements.\n\nNo stringent requirement for relative along-track control between Sentinel and\n\nC-PARAS exists. However, a generic requirement that the along-track separation\n\nshould be maintained within 10% of nominal could be appropriate.\n\nThe relative motion due to differential drag can be analysed. Figure 16.13 shows\n\nthis motion at a period of high solar activity where atmospheric drag effects will be\n\nrelatively high. The Area/Mass ratios chosen are 0.002 and 0.004.\n\nAM 0.002 & 0.004\n\n\u2013120000\n\n\u2013100000\n\n\u201380000\n\n\u201360000\n\n\u201340000\n\n\u201320000\n\n0\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1\n\ntime (days)\n\nre\nl a\n\nlo\nn\n\ng\n t\n\nra\nck\n\n (\nm\n\n)\nAM 0.002 & 0.004\n\n\u2013100000\n\u201399500\n\u201399000\n\u201398500\n\u201398000\n\u201397500\n\u201397000\n\u201396500\n\u201396000\n\u201395500\n\u201395000\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n\ntime (days)\n\nre\nl a\n\nlo\nn\n\ng\n t\n\nra\nck\n\n (\nm\n\n)\n\nFig. 16.13 Differential along-track motion with area/mass at 0.002 and 0.004 for Sentinel-1 and\n\nC-PARAS, including zoom in on first 3 days\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 497\n\n\n\nThe quadratic nature of the drift with time means that over a period of 2 days\n\n(typical Sentinel-1 manoeuvre frequency) the along-track drift is 1.5 km in this\n\nexample, yet reaches nearly 40 km after 10 days.\n\nTherefore, C-PARAS should aim for a station-keeping frequency in the region of\n\n2\u20133 days to remain within typically 10% of its designated along-track position.\n\n16.3.4 Analysis of Payload and Payload Performance\n\nIt is likely that Sentinel-1 will operate primarily in the Interferometric Wide Swath\n\n(IWS) mode. This is a ScanSAR TOPS mode in which Sentinel-1 implements\n\nelectronic steering of both azimuth and elevation beams. In order to provide\n\nsimplification, coarse mechanical beam steering in elevation is proposed in the\nC-PARAS satellites, enabling imaging of the selected sub-swath during any given\n\nimaging sequence. In azimuth, mechanical steering in yaw is proposed, together\nwith electronic scanning to track the Sentinel-1 beam in its ScanSAR mode.\n\nAntenna timing control is derived from the platform GPS.\n\nSatellite configurations suitable for triple launch in VEGA have been identified,\n\nand lead to the recommendation of an antenna with dimensions 3.6 1.4 m. The\n\nperformance achievable with such an antenna has been shown to provide a sensi-\n\ntivity (NE?0) of about ?23 dB with the addition of Scan-in-Receive (a technique for\nelectronically implementing very fast elevation scanning, in which the receive\n\nbeam is scanned across the image swath in synchronisation with the transmit\n\npulse). For high accuracy baseline determination (within 2 mm), a dual-frequency\n\nGPS receiver will be used.\n\nFigure 16.14 shows the across-swath NESZ pattern for IW1, IW2, and IW3 for\n\nan antenna of size 3.6 1.40 m implemented with Scan-in-Receive.

This includes much of the receive chain and instrument\n\ncontroller with additional sub-systems to enable inter-satellite synchronisation,\n\n(optional) direct path timing synchronisation with Sentinel-1, and sub-systems\n\nwithin the antenna structure to enable slow time azimuth scanning (to track the\n\nTOPS illumination provided by Sentinel-1) and fast time elevation scanning to\n\nenable the Scan-in-Receive functionality.\n\nThe main elements of the C-PARAS payload are:\n\n\u2022 Principal equipments and subsystems of the Front-End, which include:\n\n\u2013 The principal echo reception antenna with its associated azimuth and eleva-\n\ntion steering elements.\n\n\u2013 The optional C-PARAS antenna and associated electronics (low noise ampli-\nfier, amplitude control antenna and isolating switch) of a direct timing\n\nsynchronisation link between each C-PARAS satellite and Sentinel-1.\n\n\u2013 The small monopole (or dipole) antenna, transmit signal amplifier, Tx/Rx\n\nswitch, and low noise amplifier associated with phase synchronisation within\n\nthe C-PARAS satellite constellation.\n\n\u2022 Principal echo signal receive chain.\n\n\u2022 Ultra Stable master Oscillator (USO/STALO).\n\n\u2022 Frequency generator (which generates the various clocks and Local Oscillator\n\nsignals needed by the payload).\n\n\u2022 Radar instrument controller.\n\nThe overall satellite configuration shown in preparation for launch is presented in\n\nFig. 16.15, and the main payload characteristics given in Table 16.14. Because the\n\nillumination provided by Sentinel-1 when operating in the IWSmode to any one of the\n\ncomponent sub-swathscomes in thepulse-bursts that characterise ScanSARoperations,\n\nonly modest spatial resolution (20 m) can be achieved in the along-track direction.\n\n16.3.4.2 Timing and Phase Synchronisation Issues\n\nSentinel-1 has no provision for bistatic operations, so unlike TOPOLEV there is no\n\ndirect means of establishing synchronisation between C-PARAS and Sentinel-1.\n\nC-PARAS receivers record continuously, and ground processing recovers timing\n\nfrom Sentinel-1 datation. Inter-satellite links between the C-PARAS spacecraft are\n\nused for the symmetric exchange and recording of their respective oscillator signals\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 499\n\n\n\nto provide phase compensation information for use in ground interferometric\n\nproduct generation.\n\nInterferometric products will only be generated from the SAR images captured\n\nby the C-PARAS satellites themselves. Although the C-PARAS receivers are not\n\nphase coherent with the transmitter on Sentinel-1, it is the relative phase differences\n\nbetween the three C-PARAS receivers themselves which matter for the interfero-\n\nmetric products (N.B. C-PARAS images cannot be combined with images\n\ntaken by Sentinel-1 because the separation exceeds the critical baseline). The\n\nsynchronisation data obtained via the C-PARAS inter-satellite links allows the\n\nterm due to the Sentinel-1 transmitter to be cancelled out in forming interferograms\n\nfrom pairs of C-PARAS images.\n\nThere are two levels of timing synchronisation required between C-PARAS and\n\nSentinel-1:\n\n1. Mode synchronisation to ensure that the C-PARAS data-take occurs during the\n\ndesired Sentinel-1 operational mode (i.e. IWS mode 1).\n\nTable 16.14 C-PARAS payload characteristics\n\nFrequency, polarisation C-band, VV polarisation\n\nMeasurement geometry IWS mode, incidence angle 30? for IWS1\nKey performance parameters NESZ ? ?23 dB (including Scan-in-Receive)\nMass 111.8 kg (incl. 20% margin)\n\nPower (payload) 112 W peak/6.2 W mean over orbit (incl. 20% margin)\n\nAntenna dimension 3,600 mm ? 1,400 mm (fixed, non-deployable)\nData rate <200 Mbps\n\nData/orbit 35 Gbits\n\nTelemetry X-band\n\nFig. 16.15 C-PARAS launcher accommodation on VEGA\n\n500 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\n2. Alignment of the received radar echoes with the correct transmit pulses from\n\nSentinel-1 and the construction of the range-azimuth matrix as a precursor to\n\nformation of the SAR image, and steering the C-PARAS antenna so that it\n\nefficiently captures the echo of the Sentinel-1 illumination.\n\nThe mode synchronisation can be achieved using GPS timing. A secondary\n\n(optional) synchronisation scheme linking event timing between C-PARAS and\n\nSentinel-1 would be the inclusion of an antenna to attempt to receive directly the\n\nradar pulse signal emitted from Sentinel-1. This is expected to be very difficult\n\nbecause of the relative orientation of C-PARAS to Sentinel-1 which places the\n\nC-PARAS satellites in a null of the Sentinal-1 antenna pattern. A low power\n\ntransmit and receive system will also be implemented on each of the C-PARAS\n\nsatellites so that each C-PARAS satellite has knowledge of the relative phase of the\n\nmaster oscillators on the other two satellites.\n\nThe antenna steering and data recording are more involved. The C-PARAS\n\nantenna will be steered in elevation by rolling the spacecraft, and in azimuth by\n\nyawing the spacecraft to counter the effect of the Earth\u2019s rotation. In addition the\n\nC-PARAS beam must be steered electronically in azimuth to track the azimuth\n\nsteering of the Sentinel-1 ScanSAR antenna pattern during IWS mode. Without\n\nthis, the sensitivity is degraded. If Scan-in-Receive (SIR) is implemented, this will\n\nalso require electronic steering in elevation.\n\nThe C-PARAS processor can align its operational mode to Sentinel-1 using GPS\n\ndata, however the C-PARAS receiver Timing Control Module (TCM) is not\n\nsynchronised with its counterpart in Sentinel-1 and so precise gating of the\n\nC-PARAS receiver window to match the transmitted pulses is not possible because\n\nof the inevitable timing drifts between the two USOs. It is proposed therefore that\n\nthe C-PARAS receiver simply records continuously during the radar data-take. The\n\ndigitised sample stream comprises alternating segments of noise and radar echoes.\n\nThe entire dataset is stored and forwarded to the ground for post processing, where\n\nthe range-line sample windows can be accurately aligned with the transmitted\n\npulses using the detailed timing information in the Sentinel-1 datation.\n\nIn Sentinel-1 IWS mode, the echo window duration (swath period) is typically\n\n<50% of the PRI. In the Sentinel-1 RX processor which has access to the precise\n\npulse timing from the TCM, and so can gate its sample reception window precisely\n\nto the echo, this results in an ~twofold reduction in mean data rate out of the\n\nprocessor to the Solid State Mass Memory (SSMM) unit, compared to the\n\nfree running system proposed for C-PARAS. However the C-PARAS receiver\n\nshould be able to define a sample reception window which is accurate enough to\n\nenvelope the pulse echoes associated with a given IWS mode, based on its GPS\n\ntiming and its TCM, as illustrated in Fig. 16.16; this will reduce the mean data rate\n\nfrom the processor by ~ a factor of 3 to ~200 Mbps.\n\nIt is nonetheless proposed that the processor retain the flexibility to record the\n\ncomplete data take during initial operations of C-PARAS; if necessary, the down-\n\nlink TM constraints can be solved by either taking a shorter data-take period or\n\ntaking data only every third orbit. Once the system is proven, then the extended\n\ndata-take can be performed with on-board windowing of the selected IWS mode.\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 501\n\n\n\n16.3.5 Mission Performance\n\nInterferometric performance for DEM generation has been studied based on various\n\noptions of the SAR antenna design and its sensitivity. The 90% point-to-point height\n\nerror was estimated for two DEM products (DEM-BASIC and DEM-PREC) for\n\nmean backscatter and 90% probability, assuming backscatter properties of short\n\nvegetation and taking various error sources (e.g. baseline uncertainty) into account.\n\nThe DEM-BASIC product (30 m resolution and nine independent looks) has a\n\n90% height error of about 3.5 m for mean backscatter conditions. At 95% probabil-\n\nity backscatter the 90% point-to-point height error is below 5 m for most parts of the\n\nswath using the 3.6 1.4 m antenna with Scan-in-Receive implemented. By assuming\n\na baseline error of about 1 mm, the height error increases by 0.5 m at near range of\n\nIWS1 to about 1.5 m at far range of IWS3.\n\nThe DEM-PREC product (resolution of 90 m and 81 independent looks)\n\nprovides improved height accuracy at reduced spatial resolution. By neglecting\n\nthe baseline inaccuracy, the 90% point-to-point error is below 2.1 m for the two\n\nantennas with Scan-in-Receive implemented. Increasing the baseline error by\n\n1 mm, the height error increases by about 0.5 m at near range of IWS1, and by\n\nabout 1 m at far range of IWS3 (Table 16.15).\n\n16.3.6 Critical Technologies\n\nThe major development activities required for C-PARAS are associated with the\n\nradar antenna. About half of the instrument equipment can be derived from systems\n\nTable 16.15 Relative height error of DEM\u2013BASIC (for 600 m baseline)\n\nError in\n\nbaseline\n\nSensitivity (NEs0)\n\n?23 dB ?20 dB ?17 dB\n0 mm 2.8 m 3.4 m 4.3 m\n\n1 mm 3.7 m 4.2 m 5.2 m\n\n2 mm 4.5 m 5.1 m 6.1 m\n\nSummary of height errors predicted versus sensitivity baseline error (s0-mean)\n\n817 msec 1061 msec 832 msec 817 msec 1061 msec 832 msec\n\nIW1 IW2 IW3 IW1 IW2 IW3 \u2026...\n\ntime\n\nTiming window to ensure capture of IWS 1 echoes\nwithin the total radar data take even with timing drifts\n\nFig. 16.16 Coarse receiver timing window to capture IWS1 echoes\n\n502 T.

The parts\n\nwhich need new development are the lightweight patch array antenna, the Scan-in-\n\nReceive module and the intra-C-PARAS satellite sync link antenna.\n\n16.3.7 Summary and Exploitation\n\nThe passive exploitation of radar signals transmitted by spaceborne SAR systems is\n\nable to provide valuable information for a wide range of applications. The\n\nC-PARAS mission represents a Cartwheel formation consisting of three receive-\n\nonly satellites, making use of scene illumination provided by the Sentinel-1 C-band\n\nSAR. The generation of digital elevation models has been identified as the primary\n\napplication.\n\nThe main C-PARAS products are digital elevation models with different speci-\n\nfication for spatial resolution and vertical resolution. Accurate up-to-date digital\n\nelevation models are the basis for many applications in geoscience and technology,\n\ne.g. in hydrology, geology, environmental sciences, construction activities,\n\nplanning of roads and supply networks, etc. The availability of accurate DEMs is\n\nalso a pre-condition for high precision geocoding of satellite data. Table 16.16\n\nsummarizes the main available global DEM data sets.\n\nGTOPO30, is a global low resolution data set with about 1,000 m pixel size,\n\nbased on various sources of elevation data. For many applications, the resolution\n\nand accuracy is not sufficient.\n\nTable 16.16 Overview of available data sets DEMs (global coverage) (from http://www.ersdac.\n\nor.jp/GDEM/E/2.html)\n\nASTER G-DEM SRTM (V3) GTOPO30\n\nData source ASTER Space shuttle radar From organizations\n\naround the world\n\nthat have DEM data\n\nGeneration and\n\ndistribution\n\nMETI/NASA (planned) NASA/USGS USGS\n\nRelease year ca. 2009 (planned) 2003 ~ 1996\n\nData acquisition\n\nperiod\n\nFrom 2000 to ongoing 11 days (in 2000)\n\nDEM grid 90 m\n\n(30 m) (3 arc-sec)\n\n1,000 m (30 arc-sec)\n\nDEM accuracy (stdev) ?7 m ?10 m ?30 m\nDEM accuracy 90%\n\npoint-to-point\n\n?10 to ?30 m Ca ?16 m Ca ?48 m\nDepending on GCPs\n\nDEM coverage 83?N 60?N\u201356?S Global\n83?S\n\nArea of missing data Areas with no ASTER\n\ndata due to persistent\n\ncloud cover\n\nTopographically\n\nsteep\n\nareas (due to radar\n\ncharacteristics)\n\nNone\n\n16 TOPOLEV and C-PARAS 503\n\nhttp://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/2.html\nhttp://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/2.html\n\n\nSRTM is an interferometric bistatic SAR-based DEM data set acquired in 2000.\n\nAlthough in the science community SRTM is widely used, it has several\n\ndisadvantages related to data gaps due to radar layover and shadow, which are\n\nfound especially in mountainous areas. Another limitation of SRTM is that this data\n\nset does not cover high latitudes. These regions are becoming increasingly impor-\n\ntant as they are strongly affected by climate change.\n\nThe ASTER-G DEM is a global DEM data set derived from ASTER stereo\n\nimage pairs. Despite global coverage up to 83? of northern and southern latitude,\nthere are data gaps due to cloud cover. The accuracy varies significantly from\n\nregion to region. Toutin [2] estimated that the expected geometric and stereoscopic\n\nperformances of the standard DEM products are 10\u201330 m for the geo-positioning\n\nand elevation accuracy depending upon the number, quality of GCPs used, and type\n\nof terrain.\n\nFor the C-PARAS mission two types of elevation data sets are proposed: the\n\nDEM-BASIC and the DEM-PRECISION.\n\nThe DEM-BASIC product has a horizontal grid size of 30 30 m, and a 90%\n\npoint-to-point vertical height error below 4.5 and 6 m for areas with high and low\n\nbackscatter respectively, for most parts of the swath assuming an antenna with\n\nNESZ <?23 dB (i.e. for a Scan-in-Receive implemented antenna of size 3.6 1.4 m)\nand a baseline uncertainty below 1 mm. This DEM addresses the sequential filling\n\nof gaps and improvement of the global DEM. The horizontal resolution is slightly\n\nlower than the DTED-3 requirements, whereas the vertical accuracy fulfils the\n\nrequirements. The DTED-3 mapping requests 12 m horizontal grid, which is\n\nparticularly relevant for built-up areas. Outside of built-up areas, the 30 m grid\n\nsize should be sufficient for most applications. This product would be attractive to a\n\nwide range of scientific and operational applications, as mentioned previously.\n\nThe DEM-PRECISION product will be primarily generated for level and\n\nmoderate topography terrain, where spatial resolution is less important than the\n\nvertical accuracy. This DEM has a horizontal grid size of 90 90 m, and a vertical\n\n90% point-to-point error of 2 and 3 m for areas with high and lower backscattering\n\nproperties respectively (baseline uncertainty below 1 mm, Scan-in-Receive\n\nimplemented antenna of size 3.6 1.4 m). It is expected that this product would\n\nreplace the DEM-BASIC product in moderate terrain areas for applications where\n\nvertical accuracy is of prime importance. In addition, a particular focus will be on\n\nrepeat mapping for applications in geoscience, e.g. to study changes in the volume\n\nof glaciers and ice streams, to map accumulations of alluvial deposits, to map\n\ninflation and deflation in volcanic areas, etc.\n\nThe C-PARAS DEM products will provide significant improvements compared\n\nto the SRTM and ASTER-G DEMs:\n\n\u2022 Improved spatial accuracy and vertical 90% point-to-point height error when\n\ncompared to SRTM and ASTER-G.\n\n\u2022 Filling of data gaps in mountain areas caused by the SAR imaging geometry.\n\n\u2022 C-PARAS has the potential for near global access.\n\n504 T. Sephton and A. Wishart\n\n\n\n\u2022 C-PARAS has the potential for repeat coverage in order to monitor elevation\n\nchanges.\n\nAs C-PARAS is operating in formation with Sentinel-1, the DEM products will\n\nalso support directly the geocoding process of Sentinel-1 SAR data and the retrieval\n\nof calibrated backscatter coefficients, where an accurate measurement of the local\n\nincidence angle is needed.\n\nSecondary applications for the C-PARAS mission include the estimation of\n\nmotion fields using along-track interferometric pairs between the C-PARAS\n\nmembers. The use of three satellites with different along-track distances would\n\nenable the observation of a wide range of velocity magnitudes. With this option the\n\nalong-track SAR interferometric technique can be exploited, including the applica-\n\ntion for mapping the velocity of ocean streams and fast moving sea-ice.\n\n16.4 Acknowledgments\n\nThe work here described was performed under ESA Contract 20395/06/NL/JA as\n\npart of the European Space Agency\u2019s GSP Programme.

A \u201cSignal Cleaning\u201d mode of\n\nSAR train keeps unchanged the antenna area requirement of each individual SAR\n\nand brings a factor N advantage that applies on SNR and ambiguity protection. The\n\nmain formation flying constraint is the width of the tube containing the satellite\n\ntrajectories. The multiplication by N of the total antenna area is the other counter-\n\npart to these advantages. A \u201cAntenna Dilution\u201d mode of SAR train enables the\n\ndistribution of an unchanged total antenna area into N smaller elementary antennas,\n\ntogether with the multiplication by N of the SAR Merit Factor (Swath over\n\nResolution ratio). With respect to the first mode, the tube width constraint is\n\nincreased and the space-time separation along the track has to be very accurate.\n\nUse of appropriate spread spectrum waveforms instead of conventional pulse\n\nwaveforms removes the major part of the extra orbit constraints introduced by the\n\n\u201cantenna dilution\u201d class. A train of N SAR in visibility with a single transmit makes\n\nthe concept more robust against lost of coherence and eases the metrology of the\n\nformation (DGPS). Moreover the global energy efficiency is increased by N since\n\nwith only a single transmit SAR the same performance is achieved. However, the\n\nalong track separation constraints for antenna dilution are made more stringent\n\nbecause restrained to the space domain, which reinforces the spread spectrum\n\ninterest. As part of its applications, the concept can circumvent the matter of\n\nhuge antenna size for SAR mission in very low frequency (P band) or at high\n\naltitude (surveillance).\n\nJ.P.

Both limit the Swath over Resolution ratio that is the key\n\nperformance criteria and that we call here merit factor.\n\nThere is a particular SAR sizing called critical sizing [1] which maximizes the\n\nachievable merit factor at a given antenna area. Moving to over critical sizing\n\ncauses great extra antenna area for small extra merit factor (+100% for +50%)\n\nwhereas the merit factor must be sacrificed well under the critical one to get a\n\nsubstantial antenna area saving (?75% for ?30%). Merit factor at critical sizing is\nabout 10,000 for a maximum incidence in the range 50?\u201360?. Compared to antenna\narea, the power sensitivity to the merit factor is more linear.\n\nThere are modes and design [2] for circumventing these constraints although\n\nthey cannot simultaneously relax antenna area and power constraints.\n\nSAR train [3, 4] is a concept of collaboration of several SAR along the same\n\ntrack with two cumulative purposes:\n\n\u2022 To dramatically push the practical limitation for power or antenna area by\n\ndiluting them on several bodies.\n\n\u2022 To remove the SAR merit factor barrier and to multiply the merit factor\n\nachievable under a given total antenna area.\n\nThe N SAR fly on the same orbital arc in an earth frame, which means that the\n\nSAR are generally on different orbit planes because of the across orbit earth rotation\n\nbetween successive passes. This time delay is supposed to be under the limits which\n\ncause the temporal decorrelation of the backscatter, the SAR are not necessarily in\n\nvisibility although visibility provide a particular implementation case.\n\n17.2 A Train of N Monostatic SAR\n\n17.2.1 Basic Advantage: Energy Addition\n\nThe N SAR provide N identical Synthetic Antennas (SA) focused on the processed\n\npoint at different times. The addition of the N passes of the same (synthetic) antenna\n\nbrings an improvement by N of the energy budget and of the SNR.\n\nWe will now look in more detail to improve the understanding and discover the\n\nother properties and advantages of such SAR Trains.\n\n17.2.2 Modelling as a N Element Antenna Array\n\nWe use the representation of a synthetic antenna; that is to say the addition along\n\nthe orbital arc of S identical signal samples received by the real antenna at S\n\nposition along the orbital arc and previously corrected (SAR processing) from the\n\n510 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\nrange variation to the processed pixel. This correction makes the orbital arc as\n\ncircularly enrolled around the pixel. One can therefore consider the addition of the\n\nN synthetic antennas as a first addition of N samples coming from different SAR\n\nand previously corrected and then a second addition of the successive positions\n\nalong the orbital arc of that composite N sample. The composite sample is\n\nequivalent to the sample issued from a single array antenna whose the N elements\n\nare the antennas of the N SAR located at the N sampling points. Thanks to the SAR\n\nprocessing correction, the array automatically matches a pattern steered toward the\n\nprocessed pixel. For this equivalence, we consider that each element receives only\n\nthe ground echo of its own transmit signal and nothing from the others which is\n\nalready the modelling used for the long array representation of the synthetic\n\nantenna. The way the N samples are selected to form an array is indifferent\n\nproviding that, by the end of the addition, we forget none of the NS samples and\n\nwe do not count one several times.\n\nWe can consider a fixed array geometry flying all along the SA in spite of edge\n\neffects (where some elements get out of SA) provided that the Wave Form (WF) is\n\nperiodic (case of pulse waveform) and SA length a multiple of the recurrence\n\n(V?period). Indeed, each sorting element can be replaced by the same element\nwhen it was entering without changing the array response neither on the processed\n\npixel nor on any of the ambiguous pixels.\n\nAs shown by Fig. 17.1, the array pattern provides a coherent addition of the N\n\nuseful energies from target, which corresponds also to an improvement by N of\n\nSNR if the antenna area is kept unchanged; whiles it reduces the ambiguous\n\nenergy.\n\nAs seen later, with efficient array geometries or/and Waves Forms (WF), the\n\nambiguities are so reduced than they can be tolerated within the real antenna pattern\n\nfor merit factor improvement and elementary antenna area reduction.\n\nV\n\nt1 tp tS\n\n1\n\nN\n\nN\n\n1\n\nPattern of the\nequivalent array\n\nAmbiguous directionsAmbiguous directions\n\nReal \nAntenna\n pattern  \n\nFig. 17.1 Array model\n\nof a SAR train\n\n17 The SAR Train 511\n\n\n\n17.2.3 Random SAR Separation and Ambiguity Reduction:\nSignal Cleaning (SC) SAR Train Mode\n\nWe call section the sampling interval of a given SAR p0 and PRF the sampling\n\nfrequency. The section length V/PRF is normally a bit smaller than the half antenna\n\nlength. Because the N pulse trains are not synchronised, within a section we find a\n\ndistribution of N ? 1 other samples made later or earlier by a delay (tp0 ? tp). We\nconsider for a while an array model with the N elements of a same section.\n\nFor a synthetic antenna normally sampled at V/PRF, the ambiguous directions\n\nare off steered by kl PRF/2V. Here the ambiguity k is received by a N elements\narray according to a range difference between consecutive elements that is a portion\n\nof kl since the elements spacing is a portion of V/PRF. The distribution of\nthe element separations is random and the N contributions of each ambiguity are\n\nadded non-coherently while the N contributions from the processed pixel are added\n\ncoherently. Together with the improvement by N of the SNR, there is an improve-\n\nment by N of the ambiguity protection.\n\n17.2.4 Accurate Time Space Separation of Satellites (Modulo\nV/PRF): Antenna Area Dilution (AD) and Merit\nFactor Multiplication SAR Train Mode\n\n17.2.4.1 Synthetic Antenna Sampling Understanding\n\nWe suppose now that the spacing within the array is fixed and equal to V/NPRF,\n\nthat is to say that the real spacing between a given satellite and each of the N ? 1\nothers, at the (not necessary same) times they transmit a same sample is K V/PRF +\n\np V/NPRF with K undetermined and p \u00bc 1 to (N ? 1). The superposition of N\nsampling of SA makes a single synthetic antenna whose sampling interval is\n\nreduced by N. We can therefore reduce by N the real antenna length, increase by\n\nN the synthetic antenna length and improve by N the azimuth resolution without\n\nany impact on ambiguity with respect single SAR.\n\n17.2.4.2 Antenna Array Understanding\n\nA second way to understand that is to see that the ambiguity k is received N times\n\naccording to a range deviation distribution as\n\n2 p V=NPRF?k l PRF=2V \u00bc pkl=N\nwith p \u00bc 0 to N ? 1.\n\nThe result of the complex addition is null except when k is multiple of N where\n\nthe addition is coherent. Therefore with a reduction by N of the antenna length and\n\n512 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\na stretching by N of both the antenna pattern and the synthetic antenna length we get\n\nthe same ambiguity configuration as in single SAR, but with a resolution improved\n\nby N at unchanged swath since PRF is unchanged.\n\nWithout antenna length reduction, there is ambiguity reduction since the number\n\nof ambiguities is divided by N. This reduction is greater than in the case of random\n\nseparation. Indeed, rather than having a statistical reduction by N of each ambigu-\n\nity, we have a complete suppression of the dominating ambiguities close to the\n\nantenna beam together with a reduction by N of the rest of the ambiguous energy on\n\nthe side lobe plateau. In this SAR train concept, we have to choose between\n\nimprovement of merit factor and those of ambiguity protection.\n\nWe can reach the same conclusion by considering the array pattern. We consider\n\nan array model whose samples are taken in a given sampling interval V/PRF for half\n\nof the N SAR and in the next one for the others. We see again (Fig. 17.2) that the\n\narray pattern nulls all the ambiguities except those of rank multiple of N that fall on\n\nthe grating lobes of the array.\n\nAny mismatch of the Time Space SAR separation affects the quality of the\n\ncancellation of ambiguities other than kN and create extra ambiguity with respect to\n\nusual single SAR protection. This brings the SAR formation flying constraints\n\nanalysed later.\n\n17.2.4.3 Concept Merits\n\nThe basic point of the concept for merit factor improvement is that it enables the N\n\nfirst ambiguities to be within the real antenna pattern without changing the total\n\nambiguity budget.

In both case,\n\nthis corresponds to a Merit improvement by N and an elementary antenna area\n\nreduction by N.\n\nThe reduction by N of the antenna area reduces by N2 the level of the elementary\n\nsample collected by each antenna. In spite of the coherent signal addition made by\n\nthe SAR train, SNR is N times lower than the one available on each SAR with the\n\noriginal antenna area.\n\nWe can then summarize the concept and say that a regular interleaving of the\n\nsampling of the N SAR enables simultaneously:\n\n\u2022 An improvement by N of the merit factor.\n\n\u2022 A reduction by N of the antenna area or, in other words, a dilution of an\n\nunchanged total antenna area into N smaller parts.\n\n\u2022 A degradation by N of the SNR for a total power increased by N or, in other\n\nwords, a total transmit power N2 times greater for a same SNR.\n\n\u2022 An increase by N of the SAR data volume in line with the increase of the merit\n\nfactor.\n\nNote that the only other way to increase the merit factor should be to have N\n\nindependent T/R antennas imaging N juxtaposed swaths and requiring a total\n\nantenna area N times greater.\n\n17.2.5 Spread Spectrum Wave Form\n\nAs shown by Fig. 17.3, with standard pulse WF the ambiguity is concentrated in\n\npikes and dominated by the first ones which need to be precisely maintained on the\n\nfall off of the main lobe in standard single SAR. This is the origin of the criticality\n\nof SAR design.\n\nWe saw here before that the SAR Train enables the pikes within the real pattern\n\nonly if they are quite nulled (at price of accurate space-time separation).\n\nA continuous spread spectrum waveform can be used in SAR, the ambiguity is\n\nAntenna Pattern limiting the ambiguous energy\n\n1 / 4BT\n\nPulse wave form Spread spectrum waveform\n\nFig. 17.3 Ambiguous energy\n\nseen by antenna pattern\n\n514 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\nthen distributed at low level on all the pixels and of course dominated by the part\n\npresent within the real antenna footprint. It can be shown [see annex] that for a\n\nsingle SAR this spread ambiguity brings the same constraints on merit factor and\n\nminimum antenna area. However, the relationship is now linear: any reduction of\n\nambiguous energy that can be achieved on any of the pixel (by the array pattern in\n\ncase of SAR train) enables at unchanged ambiguity performance a proportional\n\nincrease of the real antenna footprint and of the merit factor and decrease of the\n\nantenna area.\n\nIf the N SAR use non-correlated waveforms, the signal addition is coherent for\n\nthe N contributions issued from the processed pixel while it is non-coherent for the\n\nN contributions coming from any of the other pixels, which corresponds to a\n\nrelative reduction by N of the ambiguous energy present on each pixel. With SS\n\nWF, we have the same behavior as for pulse WF with the same choice between\n\nSignal Cleaning (ambiguity reduction and SNR improvement) and Antenna Dilu-\n\ntion (+Merit multiplying), except that here antenna dilution does not bring\n\nconstraints on the satellite space time separation.\n\nWhen the N SAR use a same WF, the array model helps in understanding\n\n(Fig. 17.4). As said, it works with elements transmitting the same signal (not neces-\n\nsary at same time), i.e. spaced by synchronizing distances. An array length much\n\ngreater that SA (SyntheticAntenna) corresponds to a case of several uncorrelatedWF.\n\nFor an array length of SA/q the array pattern is less sharp and does not ensure\n\nreduction on the ambiguity issued from the q pixels around the processed pixel and\n\ntherefore the Train benefit is affected: we cannot improve the real foot print by N\n\nwithout degrading the ambiguity.\n\nHowever if the WF is periodic with a recurrence length SA/q, the ambiguity is\n\nthen concentrated on pixels of rank ?K?q (with respect to the processed one) that\nare all statically reduced by N provided that the array is randomly distributed over\n\nthe recurrence (or a multiple of the recurrence), which is not actually a high\n\nRecurrence Length\n= V .

SA must also be a multiple of the recurrence for keeping the\n\nTrain properties even on SA edges (see Sect. 17.2.2).\n\n17.3 Formation Geometry Knowledge and Control\n\nThe N SAR do not fly exactly on the same orbital arc in earth frame and do not\n\nrespect exactly the relative position assignment, if any, along the orbital arc.\n\nWe suppose that the N SAR trajectories are randomly distributed within a tube of\n\nwidth o (at 3s).\n\n17.3.1 Example of SAR Train Orbital Implementation\n\nThe N satellites use true polar orbits with identical parameters except the ascending\n\nnode and the anomaly whose respective deviations DO and DM verify a particular\nrelation.\n\nTs and Te are the satellite and earth rotation periods and R is earth radius. At a\n\ngiven latitude L, the tracks on an earth supposed without rotation are separated by R\n\nCos(L) DO. During the time delay Ts DM/(2p) between the two passes at the\nlatitude L, the earth rotation at this latitude is R Cos(L) Ts DM/Te. Therefore the\ntwo satellites pass over the same point if Ts/ Te \u00bc DO/DM.\n\n17.3.2 Basic Conditions for Coherent Signal Addition\n\nThe vector formed by two elements of the equivalent array considered at the middle\n\nof the synthetic antenna has three components. One is along the speed vector and is\n\ncorrected in term of delay deviation to the processed pixel by the SAR processing\n\ncorrection. One is along the line of sight. The third one is orthogonal to both the\n\nspeed vector and the line of sight and is called the interferometric base Borth. The\n\nsecond component taken alone give a phase difference between synthetic antennas\n\noutputs common across a significant part of the swath that can be easily identified\n\nby averaging and removed, but the effect of the interferometric base must be\n\ncorrected first.\n\nIf the interferometric base is too large the samples from a same pixel are not at\n\nall coherent, this first working condition is the one of the InSAR (cross track\n\ninterferometry) and is shown to be directly linked to the range resolution [5]. The\n\ntwo SAR must be within the 3 dB aperture of the equivalent antenna made by the\n\nrange cell. Since the present concepts are aimed at improving the SNR or the merit\n\nfactor, we can assume that they are applied in a context of rather good resolution.\n\nTherefore, this boundary does not really limit the application domain. For 1 m\n\n516 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\nresolution and 600 km range at 20? incidence, the base must be smaller than 10 km\nin X band and 120 km in L band.\n\nHowever, under that coarse boundary the phase difference between two SAR\n\ncontributions from a processed pixel varies across the swath and can be corrected\n\nonly if the relief is known. Figure 17.5 gives the phase difference sensitivity to the\n\nrelief knowledge accuracy and to the interferometric base. The corrections are\n\nmade for each of the N SAR with respect to a reference and virtual trajectory in\n\nthe center of the tube. The interferometric bases with respect to this reference\n\ntrajectory are random, with a null mean value and a standard deviation (o/6?2).\nAfter the correction, the N contributions from a given pixel whose altitude knowl-\n\nedge is h (1s) has a residual phase deviation with a RMS value e given by:\n\ne \u00bc 4p h o= 6 Sin i\u00f0 \u00de Dist lp2\n\nThe effect of this phase deviation on the module of the complex summing of N\n\ncontributions is:\n\nX\nCos(ep\u00de=N \u00bc e?e2=2\n\nAssuming the relief knowledge better than ?50 m (3s) and worse case\nconditions with small distance to target (600 km), small incidence (20?), small\nwavelength (X band \u00bc 3 cm), the tube width (3s) must be smaller than 90 m if we\nwent to limit to 0.5 dB the statistical effect on power. This is within the state of art\n\nof formation flying.\n\nThe knowledge error dBorth on interferometric base length gives a phase error\nafter the interferometric correction:\n\n4p dBorth hmax=Sin i\u00f0 \u00de Dist l;\n\nwhere hmax is the terrain height variation in the image. Assuming that hmax is\n\nsmaller than 1,000 m, this error can be brought negligible if dBorth is smaller than\n10 cm. Such accuracy can be easily achieved with differential GPS or Doris.\n\nBorth\n\nh\n\nDist\n\nPixel Angular deviation for h error\n = h  /  Sin(i) Dist\n\nRound trip phase deviation for h error\n = 4 p Borth h   /    Sin(i) Dist l\n\ni\n\nFig. 17.5 Phase deviation\n\nversus relief knowledge\n\n17 The SAR Train 517\n\n\n\nNote that the flight constraints are here computed in a very worse case. The\n\nconcern for energy budget or merit factor rather applies at high incidence and high\n\ndistance. For Dist \u00bc 1,500 km and i \u00bc 50?, the tube width limit becomes 500 m. If\nnow the system works in L band, the width limit turns to be 4,000 m.\n\n17.3.3 Conditions for Ambiguity Reduction (Std Pulse Waveform)\n\nThe ambiguity reduction is based on the fact that the N contributions of the\n\nambiguity k are not coherent when the contributions from the processed pixel are\n\nmade coherent by the processing and the interferometric corrections. A random\n\nspacing along the track introduces randomness between the ambiguous contribution\n\npaths and the tube width does not matter. There is no tube width constraint else than\n\nthose related to the good interferometric correction.\n\n17.3.4 Conditions for Merit Factor Improvement\nand Antenna Dilution (Std Waveform)\n\n17.3.4.1 Impact of Along Track Assignment Error\n\nThe samples of the N SAR are not regularly interleaved as described in Sect. 17.2.4.\n\nThe standard deviation of the phase of the N contributions is a radians when the\nstandard deviation of the sampling error is (a/2p) V/PRF. The ambiguity cancella-\ntion is disturbed, the complex summing of the N contributions of the ambiguity k\n\nlets a sum of N vectors regularly separated in phase and whose module (positive or\n\nnegative) is random with standard deviation ka (for small value of ka) if 1 is the\nmodule of the contribution. The residual part of the received power of the ambigu-\n\nity k is N k2a2. The power on processed pixel is increased by N2, therefore the\nresidual protection on the ambiguity k is k2a2/N.\n\nIn a standard unambiguous design, the two first ambiguities (forward and\n\nbackward) are close to the first nulls of the beam when the antenna is at the middle\n\nof the synthetic antenna. We consider now that the merit factor is increased by N. At\n\nthe middle of the synthetic antenna, there are N ? 1 forward ambiguities and\nN ? 1 backward within the beam aperture (defined between the two first nulls).\nAt any one position along the synthetic antenna only half of these 2(N ? 1)\nambiguities are present within the 3 dB antenna aperture. The real antenna pattern\n\nhalves the total residual ambiguous energy integrated along the arc. The total\n\nresidual protection against these 2(N ? 1) ambiguities is therefore:\n\n\u00f0a2= N\u00deS k2k\u00bc1 to N?1\n\n518 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\nThe residue of the cancellation by the array pattern of the ambiguities brought\n\nwithin the real antenna pattern (when the merit factor is increased by N) is an extra\n\nambiguity with respect to usual single SAR. In order not to affect too much the\n\nusual required Doppler ambiguity protection typically around ?25 dB, we should\nhave the residual protection within the array pattern better than ?30 dB.\n\nThe constraint increases rapidly with N and is already very stringent with N \u00bc 2.\nIndeed amust be smaller than 1/22 radians and the synchronization of the sampling\nmust be better than a part out of 138 of the sampling interval or of the half of N\n\nantenna lengths, that is to say in the order of the centimeters.\n\nHowever, we deal with a space time requirement that can be rather managed in\n\nTime domain by locking the transmit time (i.e. the PRF) of the different SAR to the\n\nprecise measurement of their relative location along the track.\n\n17.3.4.2 Impact of the Trajectories Tube Width\n\nIf the altitude of the ambiguity k is equal to the estimated altitude considered for the\n\ninterferometric correction on the processed pixel, the destructive combination of\n\nthe N contributions of the ambiguity k is perfect, except for the error coming from\n\nbase line knowledge but this contribution is well above altitude error. Therefore, the\n\ntrajectory tube width does not affect the ambiguity cancellation described in\n\nSect. 17.2.3. An altitude deviation Hk with respect to this estimate introduces a\n\nrandom phase deviation of standard value ek on each of the N contributions, with:\n\nek \u00bc 4pHk o=6p2 Sin i\u00f0 \u00de Distl\n\nThe complex nulling lets a residual part of the received power of the ambiguity k\n\nof value N ek\n2 and a residual protection on the ambiguity ek\n\n2/N. The total residual\n\nprotection against the 2(N ? 1) ambiguities is\n\n2=9\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0po= Sin i\u00f0 \u00de Distl\u00de2s2H N? 1=N\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwith s2H \u00bc the mean square of the altitude deviations of the 2(N ? 1) first\nambiguities (located forward and backward) with respect to the altitude considered\n\nfor the interferometric correction.\n\nIn X band at 50? incidence and 1,500 km distance, with sH \u00bc 50 m, the tube\nwidth must be smaller than 32 m when N is great and must be smaller than 23 m for\n\nN \u00bc 2 to get the required residual protection of ?30 dB. These width values are\nproportional to l and to the distance.\n\nThe antenna dilution + merit factor improvement application highly tightens the\n\nconstraint on trajectory width with respect to what is only required for the basic\n\ncoherent signal addition. It brings also constraints on terrain smoothness sH.\nHowever the practical implementation of merit factor improvement is primarily\n\n17 The SAR Train 519\n\n\n\nlimited by the along track constraint, except in the case of N \u00bc 2 or in the case of\nuse of appropriate waveforms.\n\n17.3.4.3 Case with N \u00bc 2\n\nThe spacing SD between the two satellites must be (2K + 1)V/2PRF.\n\nThis can be achieved by locking the PRF on distance measurement. Assuming\n\na rather long antenna of 10 m, the maximum sampling error is ?3.5 cm\n(see Sect. 17.3.4.1) and is removed by a relative PRF adjustment of ?3.5 ? 10?5\nif the distance between the satellites is 1 km. Such fine PRF adjustment does not\n\nconflict with the much coarser one required for running the instrument. The\n\nsampling constraint relies only on the accuracy of the distance measurement in\n\nthe order of 1 cm that can be achieved, when the two satellites are in visibility, with\n\ndifferential GPS or any laser or RF ranging system. The particular aspects of trains\n\nwith SAR in visibility will be considered later.\n\nThe tube width constraint and the terrain smoothness constraints exposed\n\npreviously can be relaxed since there is only one of the two ambiguities at any\n\none time within the 3 dB aperture. It is possible to make a interferometric\n\ncorrection not any more based on the altitude of processed pixel but based on\n\nthe forward ambiguity at the beginning of the synthetic antenna and on the\n\naltitude of the backward ambiguity at the end (linearly variable correction).\n\nThe ambiguity cancellation is now driven by the ambiguity altitude knowledge\n\n(instead of the overall terrain smoothness sH) whereas the actual altitude differ-\nence with those of the processed pixel (which is not anymore corrected from\n\ninterferometric error) affects the coherent signal summing, which is a less\n\nsensitive matter. We assume that the altitude RMS knowledge can be reduced\n\nto 20 m (sH \u00bc 20 m in Sect. 17.3.4.2) then the tube width requirement is 58 m\n(3s) and the altitude difference H (3 h in equation of Sect. 17.3.2) between\nprocessed and ambiguous pixel must be smaller than 430 m, all this for X band at\n\n50? incidence and 1,500 km distance. The concept is not any more restrained to\nquite flat areas.\n\n17.3.5 Use of Spread Spectrum Waveforms\n\nFor the constraint of coherent signal addition there is no difference with respect to a\n\npulse wave form. The interest of spread waveforms is related to the ambiguities\n\nsince they are anywhere and benefit from non coherent addition as long as the\n\nwaveforms are non correlated or, for identical wave form, as long as the\n\nsynchronizing distances (see Sect. 17.2.5) are random at the scale of the recurrence\n\nlength and the synthetic antenna is a multiple of the recurrence. This makes rather\n\neasy condition in comparison with pulse waveform case. These conditions are not\n\naffected by the tube width and the later is only constrained by the coherent signal\n\n520 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\naddition. All these drastic relaxations of the formation control represent the major\n\nadvantage of this waveform particularly, as we will see now, in the case of a train\n\nwith N SAR in visibility.\n\n17.4 Train with N SAR in Visibility\n\n17.4.1 A Practical Case of SAR Train Implementation\n\nAll what is said before suppose that neither the backscatter from the processed pixel\n\nnor the atmospheric delay change between the different passes. Both actually can\n\nvary and this is known as the major limitation of the multi-pass SAR interferometry,\n\nunless the time delay between passes is small. A SAR train with several SAR in\n\nvisibility is a robust configuration against such constraints. This also eases the\n\nranging of the formation.\n\nOn the other hand, if all the SAR transmit, each antenna receives N signals that\n\ncannot be separated except by using appropriate waveforms. A radical solution is to\n\nhave a single transmit SAR.\n\n17.4.2 SAR Train with a Single Transmit: Equivalent\nTrain of T/R SAR\n\nAs shown by Fig. 17.6, each couple formed by a transmitter and a receiver\n\ncorresponds on phase (or range) round trip viewpoint to an equivalent T/R antenna\n\nlocated at midpoint between the Transmitter and the Receiver. If the Transmit is\n\nalso Receive, the equivalent T/R is the real one.\n\nWe can then consider an equivalent SAR train formed by the equivalent T/R.\n\nBecause of this midway location of the equivalent T/R satellite, all the formation\n\nconstraints previously analyzed are relaxed by a factor 2. However, since there is a\n\nsingle transmit signal, the along track Space Time separation requirement can be\n\nT/R 1R 2R 3R N T/R 2T/R 3T/R N\n\nVirtual  T/R antennas\n\ndN\n\ndT/R N = 1/2 dN=\n shift between Synth. Ant  centers\n\nFig. 17.6 Train of N satellites (N ? 1 receive only)\n\n17 The SAR Train 521\n\n\n\nmanaged only in space domain. The single transmit case makes the concept very\n\nuneasy (Antenna dilution + merit factor improvement). For the particular case of\n\ntwo satellites, we have described here before (Sect. 17.3.4.3) a practical time\n\ndomain solution based on the locking of the PRF from the measurement of the\n\ninter-distance. For other cases, this constraint of regular interleaving makes\n\nthe concept very uneasy. We can imagine a weighting of the elements of the\n\narray to provide an array pattern with a very low side lobes level and another\n\ntype of ambiguity reduction less sensitive to SAR spacing than the very nulling\n\napproach. However, to get the same level of reduction requests a great number of\n\nextra array elements and satellites without any extra benefit on merit factor or on\n\nSNR.\n\nA radical solution for keeping all the concept merits for N > 2 is to use a spread\nspectrum wave form.\n\nAll the N antenna need to look toward the same ground area illuminated by\n\nthe Transmit antenna. All the equivalent synthetic antennas start and finish in\n\nthe same time but are shifted with respect to those of the T/R by the half of the\n\ndistance between the T and each R. The SAR combination can be done only within\n\nthe overlapping part of the equivalent synthetic antennas and the global length is\n\ntherefore reduced by the virtual formation length or half of the real formation\n\nlength. This means that the formation length has to be small with respect to the\n\nsynthetic antenna length.\n\nThe transmit signal is added coherently N times. Although there is a single\n\nTransmit, the SNR of the N SAR combination is the same as for a train of N T/R\n\nwithout visibility. All the concept merits of a standard train without visibility apply\n\nhere too but the total transmit power is reduced by N.\n\nWith spread spectrum waveforms, the synchronizing distances (Sect. 17.2.5) is\n\nmuch smaller than the synthetic antenna length. Therefore, the Train advantages\n\nrequire a periodic waveform and equivalent T/R randomly distributed along the\n\nrecurrence length, that is to say real receive satellites randomly distributed on twice\n\nthe recurrence length.\n\n17.4.3 SAR Train in Visibility with Several Transmits\n\nWe consider now that all the SAR of a \u201cvisibility Train\u201d transmit and receive and use\n\nuncorrelated spread spectrum waveforms. Each transmits satellite drives a SAR\n\nTrain. There is a supplementary coherent addition between the N SAR Trains with\n\nnon-coherent addition of ambiguities since thewaveforms are uncorrelated. Themerit\n\nfactor is again increased by N with a total antenna area now N times smaller than\n\nsingle SAR at price of a new degradation by N2 of the SNR. With respect to single\n\nSAR, the total antenna area is divided by N, the merit factor increased by N2, but the\n\ntotal power (now distributed on N bodies) must be increased by N3 for a same SNR.\n\n522 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\n17.4.4 A Particular Application Case: GMTI (Ground Moving\nTarget Identification)\n\nIt has been shown [6] that an along track formation of four SAR (in visibility) is a\n\ngood approach for providing GMTI products while saving antenna area. Indeed, the\n\nGMTI performance is driven by the SAR antenna length and an along track\n\nformation of N antennas allows the construction of a very long antenna, although\n\nthe gaps between antennas introduce some performance degradation with respect to\n\na true long antenna. Since a GMTI SAR has also to provide standard SAR products,\n\nthe along track formation can also be used for improving the SAR performance by\n\nusing the present SAR train technique (N SAR in visibility). In Ref. [6] we use the\n\ntwo modes of the SAR train. The Antenna Dilution (AD) mode which multiplies by\n\nN the equivalent SAR antenna Area extends the maximum incidence up to the point\n\nthat should require an antenna height N time greater in monostatic SAR to keep the\n\nsame ambiguity ratio. With N \u00bc 2 (because a AD SAR Train involves a very tight\nspacing control except if N \u00bc 2, as seen before) the maximum incidence is\nincreased from 62? to 71?, which gives a dramatic improvement in term of coverage\nand revisit with exactly the same hardware. For incidence lower than mono-static\n\nmaximum incidence (62?), we can use the Signal Cleaning SAR Train mode. With\nN \u00bc 4 (no tight spacing control in SC SAR Train) either the SNR or the range\nresolution is improved by 4 together with an improvement of 6 dB of the ambiguity\n\nprotection.\n\n17.5 Conclusion and Further Works\n\nWe have shown the capability of a SAR Train to dilute the power or antenna area\n\nconstraint on several bodies, and to multiply the merit factor achievable under a\n\ngiven antenna area. We have identified the associated constraints on formation\n\ncontrol together with the merit of spread spectrum waveforms to relax them and to\n\nextend the application of the concept. More work is needed in several areas, for\n\nexample:\n\n\u2022 Practical implementation of spread spectrum with real ambiguity functions and\n\nresearch of randomness criteria for the synchronizing distances.\n\n\u2022 Application in connection with GMTI (Ground Moving Target Identification)\n\nand/or in case of predominance of point target concern.\n\n\u2022 Application for SAR missions requiring large antenna area (P band and/or high\n\naltitude and incidence) and high coverage capability (monitoring).\n\n17 The SAR Train 523\n\n\n\nAppendix: Spread Spectrum SAR\n\nAs shown by Fig. 17.3, the Doppler/range ambiguity function with a spread\n\nspectrum waveform looks like a thumbtack, with a narrow spike surrounded by a\n\nlow pedestal of thickness 1/4BT (B \u00bc bandwidth, T \u00bc integration time) while the\nsame ambiguous energy is concentrated on a grid of well-separated spikes without\n\npedestal in the pulse waveform case. The ambiguous energy AE affecting a given\n\npixel is the sum of the energy on each pixel multiplied by 1/4BT.\n\nWe can consider that the polluting pixels are only those present in the main beam\n\nfootprint. This number is:\n\nT V=raz\u00f0 \u00de S=rrg\n? ? \u00bc T V=raz\u00f0 \u00de 2 S B sin i\u00f0 \u00de=C\u00f0 \u00de\n\nwith:\n\nV \u00bc ground speed\nraz \u00bc azimuth resolution\nrrg \u00bc range resolution \u00bc C/(2 sin(i) B)\nS \u00bc swath\nThen AE \u00bc (S/raz) (Vsin(i)/2C)\n\nWe see that, like the case of pulse waveforms, the merit factor S/raz and therefore\n\nthe minimum antenna area are directly constrained by the ambiguity performance.\n\nOne difference with respect to pulse waveforms is that the relationship is linear.\n\nThe sizing criticality in case of pulse waveforms (see Sect. 17.1) results from the\n\nfact that the first lateral (rank 1 ambiguity) spikes dominate the ambiguous energy.\n\nIndeed, unlike the other spikes, they cannot be rejected on the plateau of antenna\n\nside lobes unless a dramatic increase of the antenna area and reduction of merit\n\nfactor. They are located in much steeper part of the pattern on the fall off of the\n\nmain lobe.\n\nThe other difference is that for a same ambiguity protection AE about ?20 dB,\nthe constraints looks much more severe. Indeed, S/raz should be limited by C/(50 V\n\nSin(i), that is to say by about 1,200 instead of 10,000 with pulse wave form. In fact,\n\nthe actual ambiguity ratio is the product of the ambiguity protection by the level\n\ndifference between the ambiguous pixel and the useful one. Because of the large\n\naveraging effect, we can consider that this level difference is null in case of spread\n\nwaveforms. With pulse waveform we need to be much more prudent since the\n\nambiguity is concentrated in only four areas (the rank 1 ambiguities). Assuming a\n\n20 dB total radiometric it makes sense to consider situations where the four areas\n\nare globally 10 dB higher that the low level pixels. By taking a 20 dB protection in\n\npulse waveform case and only 10 dB in spread case, we can expect a quite similar\n\nstatistical result on the actual ambiguity ratio with a value around 10 dB. We can\n\nconclude that the two waveforms lead to equivalent constraint for merit factor and\n\nminimum antenna area.\n\n524 J.P. Aguttes\n\n\n\nNote that in case of a periodic waveform, the ambiguity function is duplicated in\n\ntime domain with a repetition equal to the period Te and the pedestal is a comb of\n\nfrequency lines spaced by 1/Te. The spreading effect and the properties with respect\n\nto pulse waveform are still valid since the antenna pattern sees only one recurrence\n\nin time domain (Te >> range aperture/C) and plenty of lines in frequency domain.\nNote also that the ambiguity criteria considered here corresponds to the case\n\nwhere the imaging interest is on scattered targets. A point target context reinforces\n\nthe spread spectrum merit since all the ambiguities are made scattered.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The proposed SAR is based on a larger\n\ntransmitting satellite and a set of lightweight receiving-only platforms. This archi-\n\ntecture also enables multi-mission capabilities. In particular, forests observation\n\nand biomass estimation based on side-looking SAR data can be in theory combined\n\nwith near nadir interferometric ice sounding.

Nonetheless, technical challenges\n\nhave prevented the implementation in space of low frequency imaging radars\n\nbecause they require very large antennas (order of 100 m2 in P-band) to achieve\n\nadequate power and reduce ambiguities. Moreover, a traditional sensor implemen-\n\ntation has strong limitations for scientific applications. As an example, full\n\npolarization features, necessary to correct Faraday rotation, lead to double the\n\nradar Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) for a given level of azimuth ambiguities.\n\nTherefore, in order to keep an acceptable level of range ambiguities, the swath has\n\nto be reduced, which in turn impacts global coverage and revisit time capabilities\n\nwith consequent limitation of system effectiveness.\n\n\u201cBiomass\u201d is one of the three ESA Earth Explorer mission candidates and it is\n\ncurrently undergoing phase A [1]. It is based on a P-band side-looking SAR, and\n\ndifferent concepts are being explored to fulfill scientific requirements [2, 3], such as\n\nvery large planar or reflector antennas.\n\nCompared with a monolithic sensor implementation as the one foreseen in\n\nBiomass, a distributed SAR can in principle overcome some constraints. If the\n\nsignal transmitted by a radar antenna is received by a multiple antenna system, the\n\nglobal system PRF depends on actual PRF and on the number of satellites, provided\n\nthat accurate positioning and synchronization among all the satellites is guaranteed.\n\nIn this framework, potential scientific applications of a P-band distributed SAR\n\nare briefly summarized and the distributed payload concept is presented. After a\n\nperformance analysis, mission design, formation flying dynamics, and platform-\n\nrelated aspects are then briefly discussed. Finally, a short critical analysis is\n\npresented to focus the main issues for spaceborne low frequency SARs based on\n\nformation flying. Part of these results has been derived under contract with the\n\nItalian Space Agency in 2007.\n\n18.2 Scientific Applications\n\nP-band is of interest to Earth science thanks to the fact that its wavelength (longer\n\nthan current spaceborne X, C, and L band SARs) is able to penetrate forest canopy\n\nand ice, depending on a number of parameters (salinity, humidity, etc.). Two main\n\napplication fields can benefit from such capabilities:\n\n\u2022 Forest areas classification and biomass estimation;\n\n\u2022 Ice sheets sounding and subsurface analysis.\n\nIt is also worth noting that low frequency SAR capability to map the subsurface\n\ndown to several meters in arid areas enables a great potential for terrestrial\n\napplications, such as hydrology, geology, water and oil resources, and archaeology.\n\n528 G. Fasano et al.\n\n\n\n18.2.1 Forest Areas Classification and Biomass Estimation\n\nLow frequency radars can help to retrieve forest biomass, alsomonitoring disturbances\n\nandflooded forests, because canopypenetration is significant and the radar scattering is\n\nmainly caused by large scattering elements, such as trunks and large branches where\n\nmost of the above-ground biomass is stored. As a consequence, P-band backscattering\n\nis connected to the so called \u201cwoody\u201d biomass. From this point of view, a P-band\n\nspaceborne radar can be considered as a unique instrument to provide global coverage\n\nof both boreal and tropical forests, with the possibility of biomass estimation up to\n\nlimits which, due to signal saturation [4\u201310], are unachievable using higher\n\nfrequencies, which on the other hand can be used to estimate leaf biomass. Biomass\n\ninformation is of great importance with regard to the requirements of the terrestrial\n\ncarbon cycle scientific community, filling a crucial gap in the data requirements for\n\ncoupled models of the Earth System. Inversion techniques to retrieve biomass infor-\n\nmation from P-band backscatter are well documented in literature and have been\n\napplied both in boreal and in tropical forests [4, 8, 9] and several airborne experiments\n\nhave been carried out over selected test sites.\n\nThefirst airborneSARsystemoperatingbelow1GHzwasAIRSAR,whichhas been\n\nrun by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) since 1987, with a P-band (440MHz)\n\nmode [11]. Over the past few years other systems have been developed operating in the\n\nsame range of frequencies, such as RAMSES and E-SAR [11]. The several airborne\n\ncampaigns that have taken place in a wide variety of forest biomes have shown that the\n\ncross-polarizedHorizontal-Vertical (HV)backscatter has the largest dynamic range and\n\nthe highest correlation with biomass [1]. Recent results from the BioSAR flight\n\ncampaign have also shown that HH backscatter has a similar behavior in hemiboreal\n\nforests, while L-band data are of less utility both in terms of correlation coefficients and\n\ndynamic range [9]. Other recent techniques to estimate biomass in the saturation region\n\nexploit polarimetric SAR interferometry and tomography [9].\n\nBesides biomass estimation, the strong contrast in P-band between forests and\n\nunforested areas also allows realization of accurate forest and deforestation maps,\n\ncontributing to estimate the rate of deforestation and re-growth in tropical areas.\n\nMoreover, P-band measurements can give improved information on forest inunda-\n\ntion cycles thanks to better penetration into canopy.\n\n18.2.2 Ice Sheets Sounding and Subsurface Analysis\n\nSince P-band radiation is also capable of penetrating fresh ice up to depths of a few\n\nkilometers, a spaceborne P-band sensor can provide a global 3D mapping of the\n\nwhole Antarctica, with subsurface information on ice thickness, glacial topography\n\nand internal layering. It is worth noting that knowledge of these parameters is at the\n\nmoment limited to a few areas because such measurements have been obtained by\n\nmeans of airborne or ground-based low frequency radars. On the other hand,\n\n18 P-Band Distributed SAR 529\n\n\n\nimprovement of Antarctica subsurface knowledge would be very important in the\n\nframework of climate and sea level studies, due to the key role played by the\n\ndynamics of large ice sheets.\n\nFirst studies about spaceborne implementation of low frequency ice sounding\n\nfocused on a nadir pointing synthetic aperture radar, which allows suppression of\n\nthe received surface clutter and isolation of the internal layers echoes [12, 13]. In\n\nmore detail, the surface clutter can be reduced by the antenna pattern in the across-\n\ntrack direction and by Doppler filtering in the along-track direction.\n\nRecent studies carried out within the GISMO project [14, 15] focused on the\n\npossibility to use a near nadir cross-track interferometer to remove surface clutter\n\npreserving basal echoes, so as to generate a 3d model of the bedrock and a global\n\nmapping of ice thickness. The latter measurement technique has the potential to be\n\napplied in a distributed sensor framework.\n\nBoth the nadir sounding and the cross-track interferometric observation modes\n\nhave recently been demonstrated in airborne experiments in Greenland [16, 17]\n\nwhere it has resulted that the number of receiving channels is an important variable\n\nfor surface clutter suppression.\n\n18.3 Concept Development\n\n18.3.1 Distributed Payload Concept\n\nIn terms of observation technique, forests monitoring and biomass estimation\n\nrequire a conventional side-looking SAR geometry. In this case, the distributed\n\npayload is based on a (quasi) linear formation comprised of a number of satellites\n\nmoving on the same trajectory with respect to an Earth-fixed reference frame. The\n\nbasic concept of distributed SAR is to enhance azimuth sampling capability without\n\nimpacting range ambiguities [18\u201321]. This is why performance limits of monolithic\n\nSAR systems can be in principle overcome.\n\nThe multi-platform payload is comprised of a number of cooperating antennas\n\nreceiving the radar signal transmitted by one or more of them and reflected by the\n\nEarth surface. As a consequence, it is possible to define a \u201cglobal\u201d system PRF that\n\ndepends on the actual transmitted PRF and on the number of receiving satellites\n\n(Nsat). Figure 18.1 explains the difference between the monolithic and the\n\ndistributed SAR implementation. In the traditional SAR concept (Fig. 18.1a), the\n\nsynthetic antenna is built on the basis of the echoes gathered by the radar antenna\n\nalong its trajectory. If V is the satellite velocity, the spacing between the acquired\n\nsignal samples is then V/PRF. In the distributed concept (Fig. 18.1b, c), different\n\nsatellites contribute to the signal sampling along the trajectory, so that the same\n\nazimuth sampling capability can be guaranteed by using a lower transmission PRF\n\non board single satellites. In particular, under ideal conditions, the global PRF is\n\ndirectly proportional to Nsat.\n\n530 G. Fasano et al.\n\n\n\nThe main advantage of the distributed concept lies in the fact that azimuth\n\nambiguities depend on global PRF, while range ambiguities depend on actual\n\ntransmitted PRF [22]. This paves the way to increasing sensor swath and/or\n\nimproving resolution, while keeping acceptable values for the ambiguity to signal\n\nratios. Of course, the system relies on accurate positioning and synchronization\n\namong all the satellites which fly in formation. In fact, along-track positioning is\n\nrelated to uniformity of azimuth sampling. Moreover, each antenna is relatively\n\nsmall and by itself relatively useless, whereas the combined processing of all the\n\nreceived signals leads to high observation performance. The distributed SAR\n\nconcept can be theoretically achieved by two different configurations, which can\n\nbe defined as multi-monostatic and multistatic.\n\nIn the multi-monostatic system, each antenna is transmitting/receiving its own\n\nsignal in proper positions along the orbit (see Fig. 18.1b). The main advantage of\n\nthe multi-monostatic configuration is that tight real time control of the formation is\n\nnot necessary. In fact, in this case azimuth sampling accuracy is connected to the\n\nchoice of transmission instants, so accurate real time knowledge (not control) of\n\nrelative position is required. However, since each antenna has to receive only its\n\ntransmitted signal 3 dB beams in azimuth must not intersect (neglecting side-lobes).\n\nThus, given the large 3 dB angles corresponding to relatively small antenna\n\ndimensions at P-band, required along-track distances should be of the order of\n\n200 km. Of course, this poses major problems in determination and control\n\na b\n\nc\n\nV/PRF Velocity direction\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nV/PRF Velocity direction\n\n1 12 3 2\n\nV/PRF\nVelocity direction\n\n2 2 1 3 3 1\n\nFig. 18.1 Classical monostatic SAR concept (a); distributed SAR with multi-monostatic geome-\n\ntry (b); distributed SAR with multistatic geometry (c). Different colours are used for the different\n\nsignal transmission instants. Dotted squares and arrows identify equivalent monostatic SAR\nsatellites and signals\n\n18 P-Band Distributed SAR 531\n\n\n\nof relative position and attitude (besides introducing some temporal decorrelation\n\neffects that depend on wavelength). A solution consists in using different orthogo-\n\nnal codes for the transmitters. Indeed, if the single satellites are able to receive not\n\nonly their own signal, but also the signals transmitted by the other satellites, this\n\nleads to a significant increase of the number of sampling points.\n\nAnother possible solution is that the different apertures receive the same trans-\n\nmitted signal (multistatic configuration, see Fig. 18.1c where satellites depicted in\n\ndotted squares correspond to the location of the effective bistatic phase centers).\n\nThe main drawback of this architecture is that location of bistatic phase centers\n\ndepends on satellites along track distance, so that accuracy in real time relative\n\nposition control is strictly connected to uniformity in azimuth sampling. Within this\n\nframework, there exists a number of techniques for dealing with non uniform\n\nazimuth sampling [21, 23].\n\nIn a multistatic architecture, along track baseline between receiving satellites is\n\nflexible and can be chosen according to the following equation [23]:\n\nDxi \u00bc 2 V\nPRF\n\ni? 1\nNsat\n\n\u00fe ki\n? ?\n\n;\n\ni 2 2; 3; :::;Nsatf g; ki 2 Z\n(18.1)\n\nThe same equation holds in the multi-monostatic case without the factor two and\n\nconsidering signal transmission instants.\n\nIn the performed study, it was supposed to have a multistatic architecture with a\n\n(larger) \u201cmother\u201d spacecraft flying a transmitting-only antenna. The linear forma-\n\ntion is then comprised of \u201cchildren\u201d microsatellites, with low weight receiving-only\n\nantennas. This leads to the possibility of optimizing transmitter and receivers\n\nseparately, avoiding transmit interference problems, and thus enabling larger PRF\n\nflexibility. Moreover, a larger antenna allows transmission into a smaller 3 dB lobe\n\nof a higher RF peak power, which is important to improve Noise Equivalent Sigma\n\nZero. Finally, as it will be discussed later, from the application point of view this\n\nscenario is more suitable for a multi-objective mission.\n\n18.3.2 Preliminary Performance Analysis\n\nGiven the principle of the system, different choices are possible in terms of number\n\nof receivers, antenna dimensions both for the transmitter and the receivers,\n\nprocessed Doppler bandwidth. Basically, by increasing the number of satellites\n\nthe following results are obtained: for given ambiguity requirements, actual PRF\n\ndecreases, ground swath increases, data rate for the single satellite can increase or\n\ndecrease depending on the actual PRF but also on the desired swath. On the other\n\nhand, a larger number of satellites can be used to improve range and ambiguity\n\nperformance, while keeping adequate data rates and swaths.\n\n532 G. Fasano et al.\n\n\n\nOn the basis of P-band antenna realization technologies (see for example [3]), it\n\ncomes out that a reasonable choice consists in using, as the basic transmitting/\n\nreceiving units, patches of a diameter of 44 cm separated by a distance of the order\n\nof 0.8l (wavelength is about 69 cm), which have been assumed as baseline.\nUsing small antennas with a reduced number of patches is a favorable choice\n\nfrom the satellite engineering point of view, but, due to the large 3 dB angles, in this\n\ncase a large number of satellites is needed to gain satisfying performance. Combin-\n\ning small receivers with a larger transmitter antenna guarantees a good compromise\n\nbetween system complexity and performance.\n\nFor example, let us assume a transmitter antenna of 9 ? 3 patches (azimuth ?\nrange) and square receiving antennas of 3 ? 3 patches. In the considered case,\ntransmitting antenna physical dimensions are of the order of 4.8 m ? 1.6 m, while\nreceiving antennas are of the order of 1.6 m ? 1.6 m. For the sake of concreteness,\nachievable performance for this configuration (ideal conditions) is summarized in\n\nTable 18.1 as a function of the number of receiving satellites (4, 6, 8). It is important\n\nto underline that full quad polarization was considered in all the calculations.\n\nSatisfying performance is achieved also with 4 or 6 satellites due to the azimuth\n\nradiation pattern of the large transmitting antenna. For example, acceptable resolu-\n\ntion and ambiguities are achieved in a 130 km swath using four receiving antennas.\n\nBasically, Table 18.1 shows that by increasing the number of receiving satellites it\n\nis possible to lower the transmission PRF with positive impact on swath and range\n\nambiguities, while keeping a satisfying azimuth sampling capability and thus an\n\nacceptable azimuth ambiguity ratio (AAR).\n\nFigures 18.2 and 18.3 clarify the functional dependences lying behind the numer-\n\nical budgets. In fact, Fig. 18.2 (valid for any Nsat) shows that AAR only depends on\n\nthe global system PRF and that at least 2,700 Hz are needed to obtain?10 dB. Such a\nhigh sampling frequency can be achieved without impacting range ambiguities if\n\nactual PRF is much smaller, as shown in Fig. 18.3 (six receivers) which clarifies how\n\nrange ambiguities affect the achievable sensor swath and also points out the effect of\n\nnadir echoes (upper right region of the diagram). It is worth noting that these\n\ncalculations were carried out considering as a requirement an azimuth resolution\n\nTable 18.1 Example: P-band SAR performance for 4.8 m ? 1.6 m Tx antenna, 1.6 m ? 1.6 m\nRx antennas and variable number of satellites\n\nSat number (receivers) 4 6 8\n\nPatches (range ? azimuth) 3 ? 3 3 ? 3 3 ? 3\nPhysical dimensions Rx antenna (m, range ? azimuth) 1.6 ? 1.6 1.6 ? 1.6 1.6 ? 1.6\nExample of \u201coptimal\u201d transmission PRF\n\n(for each polarization) (Hz)\n\n?700 ?566 ?425\n\nRAR (dB) ?17, ?10 ?25, ?14 ?32, ?26\nAAR (dB) ?10 ?15 ?15\nData rate for the single sat (Mbit/s) 150 170 135\n\nSwath achievable without impacting RAR (km) 130 180 200\n\nOff-nadir angle (average) (?) 25 25 25\n\n18 P-Band Distributed SAR 533\n\n\n\nof about 35mwith eight looks (e.g. ESA biomassmission foresee a spatial resolution\n\nof 50 m ? 50 mwith at least four looks [24]). As a consequence, processed Doppler\nbandwidth is a fraction of the maximum bandwidth achievable by the small\n\nantennas. If maximum Doppler bandwidth were processed, azimuth ambiguities\n\nwould be unacceptable.

In fact, over ice it is sufficient to add a classical monostatic SAR image to\n\nmake an interferometric pair with the other SAR image made by the multistatic\n\nSAR linear formation. The application requires a quasi-zero off-nadir angle: in\n\nthese conditions bedrock echo can be separated from ice surface return on the basis\n\nof the separation of spatial frequencies in the interferogram. For example, Fig. 18.4\n\n([25]) reports interferogram Fourier transform for ice surface and bedrock with\n\n50 m of horizontal baseline and 3,500 m of vertical baseline. The separation of the\n\ntwo frequencies allows for surface clutter cancellation. As it will be better\n\nexplained in the following, the possibility to combine the biomass and the ice\n\nsounding applications relies on the fact that the mother satellite can be maneuvered\n\ntowards a cartwheel-like formation (considering relative motion with respect to the\n\nchildren satellites) [26] in order to gather interferometric data.\n\n18.4 Mission Analysis, Spacecraft Design,\n\nand Formation Control\n\n18.4.1 Mission Analysis\n\nPrevious analyses showed that assuming a transmitter antenna of 9 ? 3 patches\n(azimuth ? range), acceptable resolution and ambiguities are achieved in a 130 km\nswath using four relatively small receiving antennas.

[25])\n\n18 P-Band Distributed SAR 535\n\n\n\nformation of four receivers (\u201cchildren\u201d satellites) with a single transmitter\n\n(\u201cmother\u201d spacecraft) was selected as the baseline configuration for a technology\n\ndemonstration mission which is described in the following. The designed formation\n\nflying-based P-band SAR mission is comprised of two phases: the first one is\n\ndevoted to forests observation and biomass estimation, the second one is dedicated\n\nto demonstration of interferometric ice sounding. The two applications require\n\ndifferent formation architectures, thus a reconfiguration maneuver is foreseen to\n\npass from phase one to phase two. The different architectures are detailed in the\n\nfollowing.\n\nThe reference orbit design is performed on the basis of observation requirements\n\nfor the biomass application and on payload preliminary performance. Assuming a\n\nswath of the order of 130 km, the requirement of global coverage, and the requested\n\naltitude (of the order of 550 km), a suitable choice is a 6 a.m.\u20136 p.m. sun-\n\nsynchronous circular orbit at an average altitude of 556 km. The nominal repetition\n\nfactor is 331/22, thus a maximum revisit time of 22 days is obtained at the equator,\n\nwhich is considered acceptable for the application of repeat-pass interferometric\n\ntechniques [24]. The latitude belt covered by the ground track is ?82.383?. It is\nworth noting that the mission was designed with the primary objective of forests\n\nobservation, thus this orbit can be used to acquire ice sounding data but does not\n\nallow interferometric coverage of the whole Antarctica.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the biomass estimation application requires a linear\n\nformation made up of a number of receiving satellites moving on the same\n\ntrajectory with respect to an Earth-fixed reference frame. Thus, all the satellites\n\nhave the same ground track. This can be obtained by separating the satellites in true\n\nanomaly and in right ascension of the ascending node, as shown in Ref. [27]. Along\n\ntrack baseline between satellites is of about 200 m and it was chosen on the basis of\n\na compromise between accuracy of relative navigation and mitigation of collision\n\nrisk. The distance between the children and the mother satellite is of the order of\n\n1 km. Given these values, in substance all the satellites move on the same orbit. The\n\nformation architecture designed primarily for biomass estimation and presented\n\npreviously can be adapted to demonstrate the ice sounding application if a\n\ncartwheel-like motion is generated between the mother and the children satellites.\n\nAn artistic view of the two phases of the designed mission is shown in Fig. 18.5.\n\nRegarding the first mission phase, a coverage analysis was carried out on the\n\nbasis of selected formation orbit (sun-synchronous dusk-dawn at an altitude of\n\nabout 556 km) to evaluate the radar mean orbit duty cycle requested by the\n\napplication. Starting from a global biomass map based on TURC model [28], a\n\nbinary longitude-latitude map of regions of interest was derived (Fig. 18.6) and it\n\nwas used with an orbit propagator to estimate orbit fractions useful for the biomass\n\napplication. The result is outlined in Fig. 18.7, with a mean orbit duty cycle of\n\n10.6 %. Periodicity is due to the considered orbit repetition factor (331/22).\n\nConsidering now the ice sounding application, it comes out that given horizontal\n\n(50 m) and vertical baselines (3,500 m) are needed at orbit poles [25]. They can be\n\nobtained by introducing in the mother satellite orbit a slight eccentricity (order\n\n5 ? 10?4) with the argument of perigee at 90?, and a very small difference in\n\n536 G. Fasano et al.\n\n\n\ninclination (order 4 ? 10?4?). These corrections require a very limited propellant\nexpense.

In fact, the formation is quite stable from the point of view of\n\ndifferential Earth gravity effects (secular J2 effects consist in substance in a growing\n\ncross-track oscillation caused by the slight difference in inclination, which does not\n\nchange observation geometry at orbit poles). Instead, perigees\u2019 precession has to be\n\ncounteracted in order to keep required geometry at orbit poles, even if it does not\n\nrepresent a differential effect. For example, supposing that minimum acceptable\n\nvertical separation at orbit poles is of about 2,500 m, one gets that at most perigee\n\ncan change in the range [45?, 135?] as shown in Fig. 18.9 which depicts the vertical\nbaseline as a function of latitude when o \u00bc 45?. Cartwheel was not considered for\nthe entire mission in order to avoid over sizing the inter-satellite link.\n\n18.4.2 Preliminary Spacecraft Design\n\nPreliminary spacecraft design was performed both for the mother and for the\n\nchildren satellites. Mother and child on-orbit configurations are depicted in\n\nFig. 18.10. The mother satellite carries the Tx/Rx radar in P-band with 9 ? 3\nprinted rectangular patches. The antenna is split in three panels of 3 ? 3 patches\neach: the central panel is body-mounted; the lateral panels are hinged to the central\n\npanel and are folded at launch.\n\nThe satellite is equipped with fixed solar arrays which lie on the orbit plane while\n\nthe radar is looking 25? off nadir (as needed for biomass monitoring).\n\n\u201380 \u201360 \u201340 \u201320 0 20 40 60 80\n\u20134\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20131\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nlatitude (\u00b0)\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n b\nas\n\nel\nin\n\ne \n(k\n\nm\n)\n\nFig. 18.9 Vertical separation as a function of latitude when o \u00bc 45?\n\n18 P-Band Distributed SAR 539\n\n\n\nThe Ka-Band transmitting system enables the high-rate payload data transmis-\n\nsion to the ground station: it is comprised of two Ka-Band transmitters, two\n\ntravelling wave tube amplifiers, and a mechanically steerable dish high-gain\n\nantenna. The S-Band system ensures the link for standard command-and-control\n\nfunctions (TM/TC) transmission in any attitude. It is comprised of two S-Band\n\ntransponders (for redundancy since the Mother spacecraft shall be one-failure\n\ntolerant) with their internal RF amplifiers, two low-gain antennas which guarantee\n\nomni-directional coverage, and the interconnecting diplexers and switch.\n\nTwo wide-coverage Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) antennas allow the Mother\n\nsatellite to receive the P/L data from the Children satellites and to exchange\n\nnavigation data (from the on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver)\n\nfor the relative position determination. The two systems can be operated on the\n\nsame RF band (i.e. 2.4 GHz) using the same Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) protocol\n\n(802.11 g).\n\nThe data are stored on flash based mass memories. The on-board data handling is\n\na fully integrated/modular network with system on chip processing modules,\n\nlayered software architecture and networking protocol. The attitude information\n\nis provided by two star sensors, two sun sensors and two 3-axis magnetometers.\n\nTwelve cold-gas micro-thrusters are used for the formation control and the orbit\n\nmaintenance. The configuration of the Mother satellite, for its unique role in the\n\nformation, is one-failure tolerant. Its total mass is about 450 kg.\n\nEach Child satellite carries a radar in P-band that only receives the echo of the\n\nsignal transmitted by the Mother satellite. The radar antenna (1.5 m2 ? 1.5 m2) has\n3 ? 3 printed rectangular patches and is split in two panels of 1 ? 3 and 2 ? 3\npatches, one of which is folded at launch. The satellite is equipped with fixed solar\n\narray.\n\nThe collected P/L data are transferred to the Mother satellite through two wide-\n\ncoverage ISL antennas also used for the exchange of navigation data. Children\n\ncommunicate to Earth with a simplified S-Band system consisting of a single\n\ntransponder connected to two antennas.

Scientific data are transmitted to the Mother satellite\n\nthrough the satellite-to-satellite link using the WiFi protocol.\n\nThe attitude information is provided by one star sensor, two sun sensors and two\n\n3-axis magnetometers. Six cold-gas micro-thrusters are used for the formation\n\ncontrol and the orbit maintenance.\n\nFor maximum mass saving, the Child satellite is realized with minimum\n\nredundancies (no single failure tolerant). In fact the mission can be accomplished\n\n(with acceptable degradations) even after the loss of one child satellite. The child\n\nsatellite total mass is of about 180 kg.\n\nMother and Children avionics architecture is a Fully Integrated Modular System,\n\nbased on a Standardized Communication Network. Unlike the traditional\n\npartitioning of functions into separate boxes, common resources like Processing\n\nModules (PMs) and Power Supply are shared among functions. The result is a\n\nlimited number of PMs, on which different tasks shall be allocated. To realize the\n\navionics hardware, extensive use of miniaturization technologies like ASICs and\n\nSystem on Chip, is foreseen in order to achieve significant mass and power\n\nconsumption reduction.\n\n18.4.3 Formation Control\n\nA preliminary study was also carried out about GNC architecture and formation\n\ncontrol. For both the applications, the assumed requirements for the spacecraft\n\nrelative position control were 2 m for along-track positioning and 10 m for radial\n\nand horizontal coordinate. The assumed requirement for (off-line) knowledge of\n\nrelative position was 0.05 m for all the three coordinates. The above requirements\n\nderive from the fact that the error in along-track positioning is connected to the\n\nphase centers location and thus to the uniformity of azimuth sampling. As for\n\nrelative attitude error, 0.1? was assumed as the requirement. These requirements\ncan be satisfied considering the following control architecture:\n\n\u2022 Relative position control between spacecrafts according to the leader-follower\n\narchitecture.\n\n\u2022 The relative attitude requirement is satisfied maintaining each spacecraft abso-\n\nlute attitude with an accuracy still compatible with the relative attitude require-\n\nment (e.g. absolute attitude accuracy shall be a fraction of the required relative\n\nattitude accuracy).\n\nThe designed relative position control is based on:\n\n\u2022 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver\n\n\u2022 Inter Satellite Link (ISL)\n\n\u2022 Micro-propulsion sub-system (MPS) based on cold gas micro thrusters\n\nThe GNSS receiver provides at 1 Hz the absolute position and velocity (used to\n\ndefine the attitude and angular rate trajectory for the attitude controller), and\n\n18 P-Band Distributed SAR 541\n\n\n\nspacecraft relative position and velocity. Each spacecraft exchanges GNSS\n\nmeasurements (pseudo-range, carrier phase) with the other satellites in the forma-\n\ntion. This allows the implementation of a de-centralized GNSS processing scheme,\n\nin which each spacecraft can process autonomously GNSS data for real-time\n\nrelative and absolute position.\n\nThe real-time data-processing of GNSS data has to be compatible with relative\n\nposition control requirements in term of accuracy and fuel-consumption (relative\n\nposition accuracy better than 0.2 m). MPS provides the necessary forces in all\n\ndirections and versus.\n\nPreliminary studies were conducted on formation control and operative mode.\n\nSeveral FF modes were designed for the different phases of the mission (Free\n\nFlying Mode, Safe Flying Mode, Formation Acquisition Mode, Formation Keeping\n\nMode).\n\nFree Flying Mode (FFM) is the FF mode after launcher separation. The space-\n\ncraft are sufficiently separated (more than km), no collision risk is present. Each\n\nspacecraft is under ground control. ISL and relative position determination are\n\nactivated by ground request. FF control is not active.\n\nIn Safe Flying Mode (SFM) all spacecraft are well three axis stabilized, ISL and\n\ncoarse relative position determination are achieved. In this mode, eventual Colli-\n\nsion Avoidance Maneuvers (CAM) may be executed. Altitude control activation is\n\npossible. A FF decentralized control scheme may be considered.\n\nIn Formation Acquisition Mode (FAM) all spacecrafts maneuver in coordinate\n\nway to achieve the required formation geometry.\n\nFinally, the Formation Keeping Mode (FKM) is the normal observation mode. In\n\nthis condition both the relative position control and the formation altitude control\n\nloop are active.\n\nThe relative position control was designed according to the state-variable\n\napproach, starting from the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations [29], and off line\n\nsimulations demonstrated that requirements could be satisfied with selected propul-\n\nsion systems and control laws [30]. In particular, the radial and along-track position\n\nerrors were found to be of the order of 0.1 m, while the cross-track position error\n\nwas found to be negligible in the linear formation.\n\n18.5 Outlook and Conclusion\n\nThough the study described in this chapter remained at a pure theoretical level,\n\nsome lessons learned can be discussed whose interest goes beyond the considered\n\nscientific applications and frequency bands.\n\nThe performed study showed the potential of the distributed concept but also the\n\ndifficulty in combining near term implementation and use of assessed technologies,\n\nminiaturization and use of small satellites, and significant improvement of obser-\n\nvation performance compared with a traditional (monolithic) implementation of the\n\nconcept.\n\n542 G. Fasano et al.\n\n\n\nIn fact, low frequencies on the one hand offer the advantage of very coarse\n\nrequirements on relative position knowledge and control. This allows standard control\n\nalgorithms and technologies to be effectively used for formation maintenance.\n\nOn the other hand, P-band has the drawback, from the formation point of view,\n\nthat large antennas are required to keep a relatively small lobe width: using existing\n\nantenna technologies implies relatively large mass budgets, so that it is hard to\n\nconsider a micro-satellite implementation. In the discussed study, the necessity\n\nto design a near term demonstration mission able to provide data of some scientific\n\ninterest led to introduce the mother spacecraft concept, which is of course a single\n\npoint of failure for the formation and thus an undesirable choice from the system\n\npoint of view.\n\nIn other words, full exploitation of the distributed concept probably requires the\n\nadoption of innovative technologies such as inflatable antennas.\n\nAnother important concept to be underlined is that at low frequencies a relatively\n\nhigh number of receiving antennas is required to achieve satisfying performance\n\nwith small satellites: launch strategies (single or multiple) represent critical issues\n\nfor system implementation.\n\nAnother limiting factor for system realization is that performance analyses for\n\nmulti-static configurations in non ideal conditions are not well assessed yet, which\n\nhinders mission design because it is hard to clearly identify the trade-offs between\n\ntrajectory and GNC system design, and application requirements. Furthermore, the\n\nnecessity to keep an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) hinders the reduction of\n\nantenna dimensions.\n\nL-band frequency could represent a valuable compromise for a near term\n\nimplementation of the distributed SAR concept. In fact, if L-band is considered,\n\nsmaller receive apertures can be used and full polarization is not required, with\n\nadvantages from the point of view of range ambiguities, while relative position\n\nknowledge and control requirements are still coarse. Of course, the potential\n\napplication fields are in part different from P-band (for example, L-band radiation\n\ndoes not penetrate ice significantly).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The two satellites weigh 485 kg each and were launched to an orbit\nwith an initial altitude of 500 km. After a brief mission overview the main scientific\n\nresults are presented as well as operational aspects dedicated to the GRACEmission.\n\nHere two aspects are addressedmore in detail from the flight dynamics point of view,\n\nthe formation keeping and the swap of the satellite position.\n\n19.1 Mission Overview\n\nGRACE is a joint project between the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-\n\ntion (NASA) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The mission has been\n\nproposed in 1996 jointly by the University of Texas at Austin, Center for Space\n\nResearch (UTCSR), the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in\n\nPotsdam and the Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) in Pasadena. In 1997, the\n\nGravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission was selected by\n\nNASA for development under a new Office of Mission to Planet Earth program\n\nM.

As an innovation, the principal\n\ninvestigator and the mission team were ultimately responsible for developing the\n\nflight mission hardware from selection to a launch-ready condition, with minimal\n\ndirect NASA oversight, for accomplishing the scientific objectives and delivering\n\nthe proposed measurements to the broader Earth science community and general\n\npublic as expediently as possible [1, 2].\n\nThe gravity field of the Earth is variable in both space and time. The primary\n\nobjective of the twin satellite GRACE mission is to obtain accurate global models\n\nfor the mean and time variable components of the Earth\u2019s gravity field [21]. The\n\nprimary product of the GRACE mission is a new model of the Earth\u2019s gravity field\n\nevery 15\u201330 days. This is achieved by making accurate measurements of the inter-\n\nsatellite range change between two co-planar, low altitude, near-polar orbiting\n\nsatellites, using a K-Band microwave tracking system. In addition, each satellite\n\ncarries a geodetic quality Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and a high\n\naccuracy accelerometer to enable accurate orbit determination, spatial registration\n\nof gravity data, and the estimation of gravity field models. The Earth gravity field\n\nestimates obtained from data gathered by the GRACE mission provides, with\n\nunprecedented accuracy, integral constraints on the global mass distribution and\n\nits temporal variations within the Earth system.\n\nThe two GRACE satellites have identical hardware and were designed for a\n\nnominal lifetime of 5 years. They were launched on-board an Eurockot launch\n\nvehicle from Plesetsk, Russia, at March 17, 2002, meaning they have reached\n\nnearly the double size of their nominal lifetime. Both satellites were placed in the\n\nsame nominal circular orbit of about 490 km altitude at an inclination of 89?.\nFollowing Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) operations, the orbits of the two\n\nsatellites evolve naturally for the remainder of the mission. During the science data\n\ncollection, the two GRACE satellites point their K-Band feed horns towards each\n\nother to a high precision. Over the mission lifetime the two satellites remain in\n\ncoplanar orbits. Due to differential drag force, the along-track separation varies, and\n\nstation-keeping maneuvers are required to keep the two satellites within\n\n170\u2013270 km of each other. To minimize the interruption of science data collection,\n\nthe time between two orbit maintenance maneuvers should be at least 30 days.\n\nIn the following the scientific results gained so far as well as operational aspects\n\ndedicated to the GRACE mission are presented.\n\n19.2 Science\n\nThe GRACE science goals are focusing on Earth gravity mapping and climate\n\nmonitoring as the mission name expresses.\n\nThe gravity field activities comprise the static (mean) gravity field as well as\n\ntime variable parameters which are an excellent basis for climate monitoring.\n\nAn additional climate related goal of the GRACE mission is to enable advances\n\nin the atmospheric sciences by the recovery of refractivity (and the derived\n\n548 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nquantities of temperature and water vapor profiles) and fine ionospheric structure\n\nfrom the use of GPS radio occultation data measured on-board of the satellites [1].\n\nThe GRACE mission gave many breakthroughs in the understanding of changes\n\nin the terrestrial water cycle, melting and growing of glaciers and ice sheets, sea\n\nlevel rise and its causes (ice melt, thermal expansion), and solid Earth (past\n\nglaciation, large Earthquakes).\n\nThe downloaded GRACE measurements (K-Band phase, accelerometer, GPS,\n\nattitude) are routinely processed by the GRACE Science Data System (SDS), which\n\nis in charge of retrieving, processing and distributing the GRACE data (Fig. 19.1).\n\nSDS is composed of three centres: NASA/JPL in Pasadena/USA, UTCSR at Austin/\n\nUSA and GFZ at Potsdam/Germany. More than 93% of the retrieved data has been\n\nprocessed into Level-2 data products (gravity field and related products), and\n\ndelivered to the user community via the data centres PODAAC at JPL/USA\n\nand ISDC at GFZ/Germany (see also the GRACE web sites at UTCSR and GFZ:\n\nhttp://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace and http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Struk-\n\ntur/Departments/Department+1/sec12/projects/grace).\n\n19.2.1 Gravity Mapping\n\nThe mass within the Earth and on its surface is not evenly distributed. Molten rocks\n\nflow in the Earth core, water masses move in the oceans and on the continents and\n\natmospheric masses are also in continuous movement. Since the gravity force of a\n\nbody depends on its mass, the irregular mass distribution on our planet causes an\n\ninhomogeneous and time variable gravity field.\n\nThe GRACE satellite mission concept is using the effect that regions of slightly\n\nstronger gravity affect the leading GRACE satellite first, pulling it slightly apart\n\nfrom the trailing satellite, i.e. causing a small change in the distance between the\n\ntwo satellites. For this, GRACE uses a uniquely precise microwave ranging system\n\nmeasuring the distance between both satellites with an accuracy of some microns\u2014\n\nabout one-tenth the width of a human hair\u2014over a distance of 220 km!\n\nThe unprecedented accuracy of the distance measurements allows mapping the\n\nEarth gravity field approximately once a month over a period of meanwhile more\n\nthan 9 years.\n\nThe coefficients of the Earth\u2019s gravity field model are derived from global\n\n(satellite-based, ground-based) observations based on complex mathematical phys-\n\nics. Various global static Earth gravity models, which are the long-term mean of the\n\nmonthly models, have been computed by a number of institutes (UTCSR,\n\nCNES/GRGS, GFZ, AIUB or IGG). The Potsdam gravity-field model, named\n\n\u201cEIGEN-5C\u201d (European Improved Gravity field of the Earth by New\n\nTechniques\u2014Combined with terrestrial gravity data), has become established\n\nworldwide as one of the standards for various satellite missions like Envisat,\n\nERS-1/2 and GOCE [3]. Meanwhile EIGEN-6C is available, which shows an\n\neven better accuracy and resolution due to improved and new methods in satellite\n\n19 GRACE 549\n\nhttp://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace\nhttp://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Struk-tur/Departments/Department+1/sec12/projects/grace\nhttp://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Struk-tur/Departments/Department+1/sec12/projects/grace\n\n\ndata handling, the inclusion of GOCE data and increased accuracy of Earth surface\n\ngravity data (see Fig. 19.2) [4].\n\nThe high-precision measurements of GRACE have provided us a much sharper\n\nimage of our planet. We can now take a look at the Earth\u2019s gravity field and its\n\nFig. 19.1 Sketch of the data flow within the GRACE Science Data System (SDS)\n\nFig. 19.2 The \u2018Potsdam Gravity potato\u2019 2011: Geoid based on Lageos, GRACE and GOCE\n\nsatellite data and surface data (airborne gravimetry and satellite altimetry) [4]\n\n550 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nvariations in order to see what conclusions we can deduce regarding the various\n\nprocesses which define the \u201cSystem Earth\u201d.\n\nIntegration of GRACE data into the gravity models led to a previously\n\nunattained accuracy on a global scale. Variations of the gravity field can be\n\nexpressed as deviations in the geoid surface from the rotational ellipsoid or as\n\ndeviations from normal gravity. Together, these observations provide e.g. clues\n\nabout the topographical and geophysical structures of the tectonic plates. Large\n\nblocks, such as the Andes, Himalayas and the North Atlantic Ridge, generate strong\n\npositive-gravity anomalies, whereas deep-sea trenches at the edge of the North-\n\nWest Pacific and off the west coast of South America produce large negative\n\ngravity anomalies. In today\u2019s gravity anomaly maps, we are able to identify Hawaii\n\nas the youngest link in a whole chain of partly undersea volcano cones.\n\nExtensive mountains and valleys in the geoid and the distribution of gravity\n\nanomalies are related to structures and processes deep inside the Earth. For exam-\n\nple, the geoid domes in the Western Pacific and on the west coast of South America\n\nare a consequence of the older, and therefore denser, oceanic lithosphere\n\ndescending into the mantle at these locations. Other high spots on the geoid and\n\nin the gravity anomaly maps are found in areas where hot material, which probably\n\nrising within the mantle, is pushing up the lithosphere above it. This occurs e.g. in\n\nthe North Atlantic, around Iceland and South-East of Africa. The striking deep\n\nvalley in the geoid to the south of India could be related to the northward movement\n\nof the Indian lithosphere plate. This pushes up the Himalayan Massif, thus thinning\n\nthe mantle mass to the rear of this movement.\n\nIt becomes also evident that GRACE can detect the gravity changes associatedwith\n\nsubduction zone earthquakes with moment magnitudes larger 8.5 like the Sumatra-\n\nAndaman earthquake in December 2004. Unique to the GRACE observational\n\ndata are the recovery of the long-wavelength components of the deformation field.\n\nGRACE observations provide unique opportunities to study the material properties of\n\nthe subduction zone environment up to several hundred kilometers depth.\n\nA further depression in the geoid is a relict of glaciation around 20,000 years\n\nago, when a thick ice sheet pushed down the lithosphere and upper mantle above\n\nCanada and Fennoscandia. This ice melted 6,000 years ago, relieving the enormous\n\nweight on the crust, which has continuously risen since then.\n\nConsiderable progress has been made recently by the use of GRACE data for\n\nmodeling this Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), the slow viscous response of the\n\nmantle to the last deglaciation.\n\n19.2.2 Climate Related Science\n\nHighly precise measurement of the temporal variations of the gravity field can also\n\nprovide information about the climate, the \u201cC\u201d in the name of the mission. Many\n\nprocesses in the climate behavior of our planet are water-driven: Ocean currents\n\ntransport heat towards the poles and cold towards the equator and thus regulate\n\n19 GRACE 551\n\n\n\nocean circulation. The decrease and increase in ice masses of the large Polar ice\n\nsheets are important factors that affect the climate and strongly contribute to sea\n\nlevel rise (see also Ref. [5]). The global hydrological cycle depends decisively on\n\nthe water balance of large river basins and ground water storage. These changes in\n\nthe global water distribution correspond to redistribution of masses within the\n\nEarth\u2019s gravity field. Thus the time series of the GRACE gravity field models\n\nprovides an excellent base to monitor and study these phenomena. The mass\n\nvariability is measured with a spatial resolution of about 300 km at the equator\n\nwith up to sub-monthly resolution. This allows deriving long-term trends, episodic\n\nvariations and seasonal changes.\n\nFrom these temporal variations geo-scientists have derived new insight into\n\ndynamic processes in the Earth interior, into water mass transfer processes and\n\ninto the development of ice sheets and glaciers on Greenland and Antartica. With\n\nthe GRACE mission, for the first time a systematic and thorough monitoring of the\n\namounts of water, ice and matter moving around could be performed and thus a\n\ncompletely new picture of the processes within and on our Earth emerges. On the\n\nother hand, these parameters serve to map water transfer processes between land,\n\nocean and atmosphere and are key input for climate modeling.\n\nGRACE provided the first measurements of changes in the global continental\n\nwater storage (see Fig. 19.3). The data offer more comprehensive information on\n\nFig. 19.3 GRACE based monitoring of the continental ice/water balance (GFZ)\n\n552 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nstorage changes in groundwater, in snow cover, rivers, lakes and flood plains, than\n\nany other ground or satellite-assisted observation system. Analysis of GRACE data\n\nshow how variability in climate conditions, for example precipitation and air\n\ntemperature, affect worldwide seasonal and annual variations in water storage\n\nwithin large river catchment areas. It also allows comparison with and adjustment\n\nof hydrological models, which will be used to determine climate-induced changes\n\nin global and regional water cycles.\n\nAs the GRACE time series has lengthened, it has become apparent that the\n\nGreenland and Antartica ice mass loss rates are highly variable and show an\n\nincreasing velocity (see Fig. 19.4) [5]. By combining GRACE measurements with\n\nthose from other techniques (i.e. IceSat, GPS), investigators are beginning to\n\nexplore the possibilities of improving snow/ice density models or to better under-\n\nstand GIA effects.\n\nIn addition GRACE is also providing mass-change estimates for large continen-\n\ntal glacier systems (Patagonia, Alaska, Central Asia). Meanwhile GRACE\n\nobservations are also used for studies of the permafrost regions. Extended\n\nGRACE data records will improve this understanding in order to improve\n\npredictions of the ice-sheets in a warming climate.\n\nThe GPS receiver on board the trailing satellite (currently GRACE-1) is used to\n\nobtain GPS radio occultation measurements. Globally distributed vertical profiles\n\nFig. 19.4 Variability in ice-mass change for Antartica and Greenland\n\n19 GRACE 553\n\n\n\nof atmospheric parameters (bending angles, refractivity, dry temperature) are\n\nderived and provided to the national weather services for assimilation into their\n\nprediction models (see Fig. 19.5). Since 2006 the data is operationally used by\n\nweather services.\n\n19.3 Mission Operations\n\nIn this chapter the operational aspects of the GRACE mission within the German\n\nSpace Operations Center (GSOC) in Oberpfaffenhofen as well as the used tools\n\nand applied algorithms are presented. Requirements derived from hardware\n\ndegradations on-board are also addressed.\n\n19.3.1 Flight Operations\n\nThe GRACE system consists of two satellites in orbit. Each of them has two mass\n\nmemory units one active and the other as backup. Operational use of the back-up\n\nunit is not foreseen, but it may serve as temporary storage for data to avoid memory\n\noverflow in contingency cases. The spacecrafts are controlled from GSOC. As\n\nbaseline the ground stations in Weilheim (WHM) and Neustrelitz (NSG) will be\n\nused for data dumps, an additional downlink ground station in Ny-Alesund\n\n(Norway) is added for NRT (Near-Real-Time) analysis of the radio occultation\n\ndata plus frequent status monitoring and data is available twice.\n\nCommanding of the satellites is nominally planned only via Weilheim. As\n\nthe separation of the two satellites is so small that the station visibilities overlap,\n\nFig. 19.5 GPS radio occultation data used for operational weather prediction (GFZ)\n\n554 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nthe assignment of station to satellite can not be changed during a pass. This means\n\nany reaction on dump failures can occur at the next scheduled Weilheim pass.\n\nThe Weilheim S-Band 15-m parabolic antenna provides GSOC with Tracking\n\n(Angle data) and TM data in addition to the primary function of TC uplink\n\ntransmission (4 Kbps). WHM extracts real-time data, out of Virtual Channel\n\n0 (VC0) and dump data HK of Virtual Channel 7 (VC7) from the acquired downlink\n\ntelemetry (32 Kbps or 1 Mbps, respectively).\n\nThe Neustrelitz (NSG) 7.5-m antenna is the designated, prime TM reception\n\nstation. NST acquires the downlink TM, extracts the Housekeeping (HK) data after\n\neach pass and provides near real-time, HK files on the NSG FTP Server for GSOC\n\ncollection. Raw Science data acquired at NSG is extracted and archived onsite and\n\nmade available to the Science Data System for further processing. Additional\n\nground stations are used in special situations. The NASA Polar Ground Network\n\n(PGN). McMurdo (MGS), Antarctica, Svalbard (SGS), Spitzbergen, and the\n\nWallops facility (WGS), provide support during Spacecraft Contingencies and\n\nEmergencies. Command (TC) and Telemetry (TM) sessions will be supported,\n\nand tracking data will be collected during each contact, however MMU dumps\n\nare only exceptional.\n\n19.3.1.1 Power Saving Operations\n\nDue to the long mission duration (almost twice as designed) the batteries experi-\n\nenced some degradation (cell loss). This leads to extra support of the engineers and\n\nthe operations team. New tools have been compiled always dependant on the\n\nchanging battery-loading strategies.\n\nLower heater settings near the cold points of the instruments to serve power of\n\nthe batteries have been established.\n\nThe Instrument Control Unit (ICU) including the accelerometer has been\n\nswitched off for 2 weeks since end of 2010 during \u00df \u00bc 0 (long shadow period).\nNew on-board command sequences (Macros) have been stored to make life\n\neasier and to cut down the number of time tagged commands for new requirements.\n\nThe on-call service became more intensive to observe changes in the behaviour\n\nof the satellites and to have a chance to galvanize the on-call person into action.\n\n19.3.2 Telemetry\n\nGRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) is using a pre-PUS (Packet\n\nUtilisation standard) TM (TeleMetry) technology. This means the on-board (o/b)\n\ncollected Housekeeping (HK) and Science (SCI) data are transferred via CCSDS\n\n(Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) TM Frames that contain CCSDS\n\nTM Source Packets that again contain CHAMP Application Packets (CAPs) (refer\n\nalso to the CHAMP website at GFZ: http://op.gfz-potsdam.de/champ).\n\n19 GRACE 555\n\nhttp://op.gfz-potsdam.de/champ\n\n\nTM Transfer Frames containing R/T data are transferred via the Virtual Channel\n\n0 (VC0), whereas dump data and idle Frames use VC7. The size of the Frames is\n\nfixed to 1,115 byte.\n\nR/T TM source packets are implemented with variable length and make use of\n\npacket segmentation. Dump source packets have a fixed length to enable a fast\n\ndump from on-board memory.\n\nCAPs have a fixed maximum size for each packet.\n\nThe Source Packets contained in the Frames are using a CCSDS standard Source\n\nPacket Header, but do not carry any time information (timestamp). The timestamp\n\ncalculation of the Source Packets, CAPs and TM parameters respectively is\n\nperformed by evaluation of dedicated GPS synchronous timestamp CAPs that are\n\ngenerated, stored and sent with a frequency of 1 Hz. So, the timestamp precision of\n\nCAPs and parameters is 1 s.\n\nGRACE mission distinguishes data into two main categories, HK and SCI. This\n\nmeans in the sense of the PUS, no Diagnostic service is supported. The main\n\ncategories are further broken down into R/T and dump data. These main and sub\n\ncategories are accordingly reflected within the source packet and CAP headers to\n\nallow appropriate on ground processing.\n\nUpon the categories and sub-categories the data flow of the ground data\n\nprocessing is controlled in the sense of filtering special information and packet\n\nrouting to different processing stages.\n\nBesides the on-board FDIR (Failure Detection Isolation and Recovery) all\n\nparameter processing takes places on ground\u2014this includes also parameter calibra-\n\ntion. The on-ground CAP and parameter processing is done by FRAMTEC\n\n(FRamework for advanced Monitoring, Telemetry and Control), which extracts\n\nthe parameter values from the CAPs, performs necessary calibrations, limit checks\n\nand provides all necessary information to display these values on the display system\n\nwith their correct raw, engineering value, status, colour and special formatting\n\noption. FRAMTEC offers also a convenient way to derive parameters from actual\n\ntelemetry or monitoring parameters (direct parameters) via an Operations Language\n\n(OL) which is very similar to the C programming language.\n\nOne way to monitor the actual status of the GRACE satellites is real-time with\n\nthe GUI called SATMON (SATellite MONitor), which is fed directly from the\n\nFRAMTEC processor. This can be done directly in the control room or via a\n\ndedicated web interface called OpsWeb (Operations Web) even from home.\n\nAnother way to check against the satellite status and configuration is\n\nimplemented with the Consistency Checker (ConChk) that allows to pre-define\n\nlists of parameters together with their expected values or value ranges and to check\n\nagainst these limits with a single keystroke, e.g. at the beginning of a pass to\n\nminimise the time needed for problem detection.\n\nA third\u2014more detailed\u2014way to assess the satellites\u2019 status is to analyse offline\n\ndata provided by downlinked HK store dumps. HK dumps contain data of coherent\n\nperiods of time and are processed by a dedicated process called Offline Processor,\n\nwhich is triggered shortly after reception of the offline (dump) file and is able to\n\nprocess large amount of data in short time\u2014again to minimise the reaction times to\n\n556 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nsatellite problems. The offline processing on the one hand allows assessing the\n\nsatellite\u2019s status over long periods of time and on the other hand allows the detection\n\nand analysis of problems which can very well be transient, i.e. not visible during the\n\nshort visibility periods of the GRACE satellites (about 30 min/day aggregate).\n\n19.3.3 Telecommand\n\nThe GRACE Command System is one of the major components of the GRACE\n\nMission Operations Segment (MOS) running within the GSOC control centre, in\n\nOberpfaffenhofen. Along with the Telemetry System described in the previous\n\nsection it forms the main software interface to the operational GRACE 1 and\n\nGRACE 2 spacecraft.\n\nThe system has a heritage based on many previous missions supported at GSOC\n\nnot least the precursor mission CHAMP. The system itself is based on a Core\n\nCommand System concept with a design based on a multi-mission capable archi-\n\ntecture. All satellite specific execution control, interface and database requirements\n\nwere handled by satellite specific software \u201cplug-ins\u201d.\n\nA satellite in low earth orbit is visible from a very small fraction of the Earth\u2019s\n\nsurface at any one time and has a high angular rate of motion against the celestial\n\nsphere. Ground contact with the satellite is limited in duration and coverage. This\n\nmeans that the command system and supporting network and uplink capabilities\n\nmust support the following:\n\n\u2022 High commanding rate during short contacts\n\n\u2022 Uplinking of deferred execution, i.e. time-tagged telecommand sequences\n\n\u2022 Verification and correct reception and storage of transmitted telecommands\n\nAs GRACE is comprised of two spacecraft, whose functions with respect to\n\ntelecommanding are identical, this allows the two satellites to share a common\n\nsource telecommand database. The onboard functionality is not identical due to\n\nfailures that have occurred to one or other of the spacecraft during the mission life\n\ntime. The telecommand database is compiled, validated and subsequently installed\n\non the two command servers running GRACE1 and GRACE2 respectively. From a\n\nflight operations personnel perspective the two command systems are identical\n\nexcept for a GRACE 1 and 2 specific colour scheme used for each command\n\ninterface. This colour scheme is consistent with the one used by the telemetry\n\ndisplay system.\n\nThe majority of commands to be uplinked to the GRACE satellites are derived\n\nfrom products from two of the other components of the MOS, namely:\n\n\u2022 Mission Planning; which is responsible for the generation of timelines and the\n\nassociated time-tagged commands and\n\n\u2022 Flight Dynamics; which handles orbit determination and prediction plus attitude\n\ndetermination and manoeuvre planning/execution.\n\n19 GRACE 557\n\n\n\nThe GRACE Command system then utilises theWeilheim Ground station for the\n\nuplink of the following GRACE specific command activities:\n\n\u2022 Time-tagged commands for execution of memory dumps and prime star camera\n\nswitching (to avoid Sun and Moon intrusions).\n\n\u2022 Command containing updated orbit information of both satellites to the on-board\n\norbit propagator (daily basis although the limit is <120 h).\n\u2022 Commands from other sources (e.g. special requests, recommendations, etc.).\n\nIn line with the operational requirements, the GRACE command system was\n\ntailored to support the PUS standard and is fully CCSDS compliant with the\n\nCCSDS standards for Telecommanding, such as:\n\n\u2022 Part 1 CCSDS 201 channel service\u2014CLTUs\n\n\u2022 Part 2 CCSDS 202 data routing\u2014TC-Frames\n\n\u2022 Part 2.1 CCSDS 202 command ops proc\u2014COP-1\n\n\u2022 Part 3 CCSDS 203 data management\u2014TC-Packets\n\nThe GRACE command system is based on the Core Command System architec-\n\nture and although it is no longer state-of-the-art it has shown it\u2019s pedigree by\n\nsupport numerous missions of varying scope over the last 20 years. As we approach\n\nthe tenth anniversary (2012) of the GRACE satellite\u2019s launch, the command system\n\nwill continue to support the mission until such time as the satellite is no longer in\n\nservice. To date, after more than 3,500 days in orbit, the GRACE command systems\n\nhave sent more than 1,000,000 telecommands to the twin spacecraft.\n\n19.3.4 Attitude and Orbit Control System\n\nThe GRACE satellites are themselves part of the instrumentation used to probe the\n\nEarth\u2019s gravity field. This directly affects the attitude and orbit control system\n\n(AOCS) in several ways. The inter-satellite distance must be maintained within a\n\nwindow of ?50 around 220 km and the attitude within dead bands of ?3\u20135 mrad.\nDisturbances and interruptions of payload operations should be minimized. The\n\ncontinuous fine-tuning and optimization of the control system for the benefit of the\n\nscientists implied that GRACE never really entered into a routine operational phase\n\nlike other satellites. After more than 9 years in orbit\u2014almost twice the projected\n\nlife time already\u2014several components start to deteriorate, or can not be used any\n\nmore. This also requires more and more special AOCS operations.\n\n19.3.4.1 Orbit Control\n\nTwo thrusters with 40 mN each are located at the back of the satellites. Each\n\nthruster is connected to one of two tanks (the cross-connection\u2014a solenoid valve\n\nhas been kept close since the beginning of the mission). If an orbit maintenance\n\n558 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nmaneuver has to be performed, the type of the maneuver (altitude increase or\n\ndecrease) depends on the satellite (leader/follower) and on the relative altitude\n\nand distance (refer also to Sect. 19.3.5.1). In addition, a 180? yaw slew is required in\nthe case, if the leader has to perform an orbit increase maneuver or the follower an\n\norbit decrease maneuver. Inclination corrections require a ?90? yaw turn near one\nof the nodes.\n\nNone of these choices or implementations is automated and AOCS tasks\n\ncomprise:\n\n\u2022 Commanding the correct attitude at the correct time.\n\n\u2022 Conversion of Dv, delivered by the flight dynamics group, into thruster on-times\ndepending upon predicted pressure and temperature; conversion of thruster\n\non-times into integral on-board counts, which can then be commanded to the\n\nOC-thrusters.\n\n\u2022 Choice of one or two thrusters, depending upon desired cross-couplings (e.g. for\n\ninclination control) and tank contents.\n\n\u2022 A posteriori Dv reconstruction with the actually measured pressure and temper-\nature during the burn; administration of all maneuvers and calibrations.\n\n19.3.4.2 Attitude Control\n\nTwo sets of six 10 mN thrusters are used for attitude control together with magnetic\n\ntorque rods on each axis which have a maximum moment of 110 Am2. Each set of\n\nthrusters is connected to its own tank and the torque rods have double coils for\n\nredundancy.\n\nThe exact pointing of the two spacecraft is derived from daily uploaded two-line\n\nelements; orbit information of both satellites is fed to both satellites. It is also\n\npossible to set a fixed attitude bias with respect to the orbital frame. AOCS tasks\n\nhere include:\n\n\u2022 Tuning of the ratio of the torque delivered by the rods and by the thrusters.\n\nNumerous settings of this ratio and also of several other control parameters were\n\ntried at the beginning of the mission until the scientists were satisfied.\n\n\u2022 Implementation of so-called magnetic compensation designed to minimize the\n\ninteraction of the magnetic torque rods and the magnetometer. Before this\n\nimplementation disturbances were minimized by mixing the measurements\n\nwith the on-board magnetic field model, whereby several relative weights\n\nwere tried.\n\n\u2022 Optimization of the attitude dead bands in order to minimize the number of\n\nthruster firings and to balance the number of thruster cycles per axis.\n\n\u2022 Optimization of star camera control parameters in order to minimize noise and\n\ndrop outs.\n\n19 GRACE 559\n\n\n\n19.3.4.3 Other AOCS Activities\n\nThe precession of the orbit necessitates a change of the prime star camera every\n\n161 days.\n\nAlso twice in the 322d period images are made in two eclipses without Moon\n\nwith both star cameras in order to determine the number of \u201chot pixels\u201d. The\n\nnumber of pixels showing spurious light detection is slowly increasing with time.\n\nThe degradation of one of the cameras on GRACE 2 made detection of enough\n\nbright stars around the galactic poles to a problem and prompted an even more\n\nelaborate switching scheme as mentioned above.\n\nThe configuration of the AOCS safe mode must be adapted thrice in the same\n\n161d period (also when the mode is not actually used!).\n\nCentre-of-mass calibrations are performed once or twice per year. Both satellites\n\nare being wiggled in one axis after the other by sending alternating currents through\n\nthe torque rods while at the same time disabling the thrusters. Specific orbit locations\n\nare chosen in order to minimize disturbances. Results may lead to mass trim\n\nmaneuvers; GRACE has three small masses that can be moved with a stepper motor\n\nalong a rod aligned with one of the three axes thus adjusting the centre of gravity.\n\nThe alignment of the microwave assembly was calibrated on both satellites only\n\nonce at the beginning of the mission. Also the star camera alignments were\n\nmeasured and adapted several times early in the mission.\n\nA number of components show in orbit performance degradation or has become\n\ndefunct during the mission. In all instances there is a direct impact on AOCS\n\noperations. For example the degradation of the batteries impedes the use of the\n\nIMU (inertial measurement unit; an optical gyro) and regularly calls for yaw\n\nmaneuvers in order to turn the panels into specific orientation with respect to the\n\nSun. Malfunctioning of some CESS thermistors prompted the design of an addi-\n\ntional safe mode using the magnetic field to align the satellite in flight direction.\n\nHowever, no further thermistors developed problems so far and hence this mode has\n\nnot yet been used in praxis.\n\nFinally, an administration of the use of resources is made, the most obvious\n\nbeing fuel expenditure. The projected life time can then be compared with the\n\nexpectancy based upon other factors, such as front-end or battery degradation, or\n\norbit decay (see Fig. 19.6).\n\n19.3.5 Flight Dynamics\n\nBesides the typical flight dynamics tasks performed routinely between several times\n\nper day and weekly like e.g. orbit determination based on GPS navigation solution\n\ndata, generation of ephemeredes files like Keplerian elements, event files like\n\nAOS/LOS over ground stations, etc., two dedicated requirements to the GRACE\n\nmission have to be fulfilled: (1) formation keeping within a distance of 170 and\n\n270 km and (2) swap of the satellite position after about 3 years. These two aspects\n\nare addressed more detailed in the following two chapters.\n\n560 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\n19.3.5.1 Formation Keeping\n\nOnce the initial formation has been achieved in a nominal distance of 220 ? 50 km,\nthe orbits of both spacecraft evolve naturally under the action of the gravitational\n\nand non-gravitational forces. During short time scales (?1 rev), the relative motion\nis dominated by two effects: (1) the differences in eccentricity, which are limited to\n\nless than 1.4 ? 10?4 as a consequence of the separation and drift stop strategy,\nbecause the two satellites were released from the upper stage by an angle of +60?/\n?120? w.r.t. the flight direction and an separation velocity of about 28 cm/s for each\nspacecraft related to the upper stage [6], and (2) the 1.9? difference in eccentric\nanomaly (scaled by an eccentricity of less than 2.5 ? 10?3).\n\nIf a difference Da of the mean semi-major axes exists, the along-track separation\nL changes for longer time scales according\n\ndL\n\ndt\n\u00bc a ?

Despite the\n\nsymmetrical design of the satellites, their ballistic coefficients (B \u00bc cD ? A/m)\ndiffer as a consequence of a slightly different attitude (pitch angle and orientation;\n\ncf. Fig. 19.7). To ensure a line-of-sight orientation of the K-band link, pitch angles\n\nbetween 0.4? and 2.2? are required depending on the altitude and relative distance\n(cf. Table 19.1). Within the nominal operations regime, the associated ballistic\n\ncoefficient difference ranges from 0.14% to 0.32%, if the mass of both spacecraft is\n\nidentical. In this case the leading satellite always has a higher drag and, as a\n\nconsequence, a higher decay rate [7\u20139].\n\nDifferent ballistic coefficients in general result in a rate of change\n\ndDa\ndt\n\n\u00bc ?DB ? r ? v2 1\nn\n\u00bc ?DB ? r ? a2n (19.2)\n\nof the semi-major axis difference (cf.

Fig. 19.8). In case of different attitude\n\nactivities, the ballistic coefficient difference DB will also be influenced due to\nchanges in the s/c mass. Owing to expected cycle lengths of up to 1 year, forecasts\n\nof the solar flux values and their uncertainties provided by the European Space\n\nOperations Center (ESOC) on a daily and monthly basis have to be used in the\n\nplanning of an upcoming orbit maintenance maneuver. As a consequence, the\n\navailable station keeping box will not be fully exploited to leave some margin for\n\nunpredictable density variations. Throughout the mission, the relative distance and\n\nsemi-major axis difference are monitored on a routine basis (cf. Fig. 19.9) as well as\n\nthe evolution of the mass of both s/c. In parallel, predictions of the expected\n\nmotion in the L-Da-plane have been carried out to decide on a suitable maneuver\ntime and size.\n\nFor proper maneuver planning, the individual mean semi-major axes must be\n\nresolved from the osculating states with an accuracy of better than 1 m. While a\n\npurely numerical averaging requires lengthy time intervals to give proper results,\n\nanalytical models do not, in general, provide sufficient accuracy. It has therefore\n\nbeen decided to use a suitable combination of both techniques to derive the mean\n\nsemi-major axes of the GRACE spacecraft at any time. To this end, the trajectories\n\nare numerically integrated over a time interval of six orbits using a rigorous force\n\nmodel and initial conditions from the latest orbit determination. Using a sampling\n\ninterval of 10 min, the resulting state vectors y are fit to the SGP4 model by the least\nsquare method [11, 12]. The SGP4 orbit model, which forms the basis of the\n\nFig. 19.9 Monitoring of the cycle after the 17th formation maintenance maneuver covering the\n\nperiod from 2011/02/08 to 2011/08/19. GRACE2 is the leading spacecraft after the swap maneu-\n\nver in 2005 (cf. next section)\n\n564 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nNORAD twoline element sets [13], is based on the analytical theory of Brouwer and\n\naccounts for the Earth gravitational field through zonal terms J2, J3, J4, and the\natmospheric drag through a power density function assuming a non-rotating spheri-\n\ncal atmosphere. Using this technique, smooth Da values with an uncertainty of less\nthan 1 m are obtained (cf. Figs. 19.8 and 19.9).\n\n19.3.5.2 Safe Switching of the GRACE Formation Using\n\nan Eccentricity-Inclination Vector Separation\n\nMainly to balance the surface erosion of the on-board K-band radar, both satellites\n\nhave to exchange their position (leader/trailer) at least once during the mission\n\nlifetime. After GRACE has entered the third year of the original nominal 5 years\n\nmission, such a position exchangemaneuver was planned for the second half of 2004.\n\nIn an effort to maximize the operational safety of the satellite swapmaneuver with no\n\nincrease in fuel expenditure, an eccentricity and inclination vector separation is\n\napplied. The concept of e/i-vector separation has originally been developed for the\n\nco-location of geostationary satellites, but can likewise be applied to avoid a collision\n\nrisk during proximity operations of satellites in low Earth orbits. Using a specific\n\nphasing and size of the relative orbital inclination and the relative eccentricity, a\n\nminimum radial or cross-track position offset between two spacecraft can always be\n\nensured irrespective of their along-track separation. This is of particular concern if\n\nuncertainties in the maneuver calibration or differential drag modeling do not allow\n\nan accurate forecast of the along-track motions. Likewise the ever-present risk of\n\nmaneuver failures can easily be covered by application of an e/i-vector separation.\n\nAs a result of natural orbital perturbations, the relative e/i-vectors of the two\n\nGRACE satellites vary in time and attain an optimal, parallel configuration once\n\nevery 47 days. A fuel optimal and safe separation of both spacecraft during the\n\nfly-by can thus be achieved by proper selection of the maneuver date. In adopting\n\nthe e/i-vector separation, single maneuvers are sufficient to initiate and stop the drift\n\nrequired for the swap of GRACE 1 and 2, which notably reduces the operational\n\ncomplexity and workload.\n\nRelative Motion of LEO Satellites\n\nFor low Earth orbits (LEO) the relative motion of a spacecraft formation can be\n\napproximated by the well-known Clohessy-Wiltshire (or Hill\u2019s) equations [10, 14],\n\nwhich describe the location of two spacecraft in a co-moving frame in the radial\n\n(R), along-track (T) and cross-track (N) direction. In general, the relative motion is\n\na harmonic oscillation perpendicular to the orbital plane superimposed by an\n\nelliptic in-plane motion. If the semi-major axis of the two spacecraft is different,\n\na linear drift in along-track direction is superimposed, too.\n\nAs the Cartesian formulation of the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations does not\n\nprovide immediate insight into some aspects of the relative motion, a description\n\n19 GRACE 565\n\n\n\nin terms of orbital element differences is therefore preferred for proximity analyses.\n\nThus the concept of eccentricity and inclination vectors is introduced followed by a\n\ndescription of the relative motion in terms of the relative e/i-vectors.\n\nEccentricity Vector\n\nFor near-circular satellite orbits, the Keplerian elements e (eccentricity) and o\n(argument of perigee) are commonly replaced by the eccentricity vector\n\n~e \u00bc eX\neY\n\n? ?\n\u00bc e ? coso\n\nsino\n\n? ?\n(19.6)\n\nIt is free from singularities and well suited for the study of orbital perturbations\n\nof remote sensing satellites [15]. The relative eccentricity vector D~e can be\nexpressed by the difference for two spacecraft\n\nD~e \u00bc~e2 ?~e1 \u00bc de ? cos\u2019sin\u2019\n? ?\n\n; (19.7)\n\nwhich characterizes the relative motion within the orbital plane. For small\n\ndifferences in the orbital elements a linear expansion can be performed using the\n\nwell known partial derivatives [16] of the Keplerian orbit model. It can then be\n\nshown that the relative orbit of s/c 2 with respect to s/c 1 is an ellipse of dimension\n\n?2ade in along-track direction and ?ade in radial direction (Fig. 19.10), where a\ndenotes the (common) semi-major axis.\n\nWhile de is a measure of the size of the relative trajectory, the angle \u2019 defines the\nrelative pericenter. Whenever the mean argument of latitude u \u00bc o + M equals \u2019,\ns/c 2 is located right below s/c 1. Subsequently, s/c 2 takes over and is just ahead of\n\ns/c 1 as soon as the argument of latitude attains a value of u \u00bc \u2019 + p/2 [17].\n\nInclination Vector\n\nIn the same manner, a relative inclination vector can be used to describe the relative\n\nmotion of two satellites perpendicular to the orbital plane. Here the unit vectors Xi,\nYi, and Zi (i \u00bc 1,2) describe a coordinate system aligned with the ascending node\n\ns/c 2\n\ns/c 1\n\na?e\n\n2a?e\nT\n\nR\n\nu=?\n\nu=?+3?/2u=?+?/2\n\nu=?+?\nFig. 19.10 Relative motion\n\nof two spacecraft with\n\neccentricity vector separation\n\n[17]\n\n566 M.

Using appropriate series expansions (see e.g. [18]), the\n\ncross-track motion of s/c2 can then be described by a harmonic oscillation of\n\namplitude adi and phase angle u\u2013y [17].\n\nLinearized Relative Motion Equations\n\nIn addition to the eccentricity and inclination vector difference, differences in the\n\nsemi-major axisDa and the mean argument of latitude Du have an influence on\n\n?i\n\nz\n\ny\nx\n\nOrbit1 Orbit2\n\nX1\n\nY1Z1\n\nZ2 ?i\n\nW1\n\n?\n\n?i\n\nFig. 19.11 Relative\n\ninclination vector [17]\n\n19 GRACE 567\n\n\n\nthe relative motion of two spacecraft. These result in a systematic offset of size Da\nin radial direction as well as a drift of ?3pDa per revolution and a constant offset\naD(o+M) in along-track direction.\n\nOverall, the relative position vector Dr of s/c2 with respect to s/c1 in a local\nhorizontal frame aligned with the radial (R), along-track (T) and cross-track (N)\n\ndirection, can thus be described by linearized equations as given in [17]\n\nDrR\nDrT\nDrN\n\n0\n@\n\n1\nA \u00bc a ?

It is based on the consideration that the\n\nuncertainty in predicting the along-track separation of two spacecraft is generally\n\nmuch higher than for the radial and cross-track component. Due to the coupling\n\nbetween semi-major axis and orbital period, small uncertainties in the initial\n\nposition and velocity result in a corresponding drift error and thus a secularly\n\ngrowing along-track error. Predictions of the relative motion over extended periods\n\nof time are therefore particularly sensitive to both orbit determination errors and\n\nmaneuver execution errors.\n\nTo avoid a collision between the two spacecraft due to along-track position\n\nuncertainties, the satellites have to be separated properly in radial and cross-track\n\ndirection. This can be achieved by a parallel (or anti-parallel) alignment of the\n\nrelative e- and i-vectors.\n\nWith the above introduced notation the angles \u2019 and y are equal for parallel\nvectors D~e and D~i. For this case, the arguments of latitude u \u00bc \u2019 and u \u00bc \u2019 + p\nmark the orbital positions, at which the two spacecraft show their maximum radial\n\nseparation. And in addition, these points describe also the line of intersection of\n\nboth orbital planes, at which the cross-track separation vanishes. On the other side,\n\nu \u00bc \u2019 + p/2 and u \u00bc \u2019 \u00bc 3p/2 define the points, where the radial separation\nvanishes and the cross-track separation has a maximum.\n\nIn the case the vectors D~e and D~i are orthogonal, the radial and out-of-plane\nseparation disappear together at two points of the orbit (Fig. 19.12; right). If the\n\n568 M. Kirschner et al.\n\n\n\nalong-track separation at these points is smaller than the along-track position\n\nuncertainty of the satellites, the probability of a collision is relatively high.\n\nIn the case of no along-track drift (identical semi-major axes), the radial and\n\ncross-track separation are given by\n\nDrR\nDrN\n\n? ?\n\u00bc ?ade cos\u00f0u? \u2019\u00de\n\nadi sin\u00f0u? \u2019\u00de\n? ?\n\n(19.12)\n\nfor parallel e-/i-vectors. Accordingly the distance between the two s/c is always\n\nthan min(ade, adi). This is completely independent of the along-track separation\nuncertainty. The thresholds will be smaller for drifting satellites due to radial offset.\n\nBut this can be compensated by a suitably increased eccentricity vector separation.\n\nOrbital Perturbations\n\nEccentricity Vector\n\nThe oblateness of the Earth results in a variety of short periodic, long-periodic and\n\nsecular perturbations of the orbital elements of a LEO satellite. According to Refs.\n\n[15, 19] the short periodic (sp) variations of the eccentricity vector depend primar-\n\nily on the second order zonal coefficient J2 \u00bc ?C20 \u00bc 1.082 ? 10?3 and vary\nperiodically with the argument of latitude u.\n\nAn averaged eccentricity vector\n\n?~e \u00bc~e? d~esp (19.13)\n\ncan be obtained by removing the short-term perturbations. This resulting vector has\n\nonly a long periodic rotation about the \u201cfrozen eccentricity\u201d [10, 15] vector, given by\n\n~eG ? 0;? 1\n2\n\nJ3\nJ2\n\nR2\t\na2\n\nsin i\n\n? ?\n(19.14)\n\nR\n\nT\n\nN N\n\nT\n\nR\n\nFig. 19.12 Relative motion for parallel (left) and orthogonal (right) relative e- and i-vectors [17]\n\n19 GRACE 569\n\n\n\nThe rotation of~e about~eG has a period\n\nTG \u00bc 4\n3\nT\na2\n\nR2\t\n\n1\n\nJ2 5cos2i? 1j j (19.15)\n\nwhich is roughly a 1,000 times larger than the orbital period T [15].\nIn the discussion of proximity operations, it is sufficient to consider only the\n\nlong-periodic eccentricity vector variations\n\nD~e \u00bc de ? cos ?\u2019\nsin ?\u2019\n\n? ?\n: (19.16)\n\nThese describe a circle of radius de that is centered in the origin of the e-vector\nplane and traversed at an angular velocity of _?\u2019 \u00bc 2p=TG.\n\nInclination Vector\n\nThe inclination and the right ascension of the ascending node experience short\n\nperiodic perturbations of twice the orbital frequency [15, 19].

In the planning of proximity operations using the\n\nlinearized relative motion equations (19.11), they can therefore be neglected.\n\nGRACE Swap Maneuver Planning\n\nSince the beginning of the GRACE mission, GRACE2 has been following\n\nGRACE1 at a distance of typically 220 km. Taking into account the current fuel\n\nbalance of both satellites, it was decided to perform all required orbital maneuvers\n\nwith the GRACE2 spacecraft. By lowering the semi-major axis of GRACE2, a\n\npositive along-track drift should be initiated and stopped again after passing\n\nGRACE1 and achieving the desired along-track separation. For the subsequent\n\nmission, GRACE2 would then be leading the formation, followed by GRACE1 in a\n\ndistance of 220 km.\n\nAt the begin of the position exchange, the two GRACE satellites had a separa-\n\ntion of about 170 km in early December 2005. As a basis for the swap maneuver\n\noperations, it was foreseen to initiate a positive along-track drift of roughly\n\n30 km/day on GRACE 2 by lowering its semi-major axis. Within a week,\n\nGRACE2 would then pass by GRACE1 and subsequently lead the formation. The\n\nlongitude swap was also deemed of interest for collecting additional science data.\n\nFor small intersatellite distances the K-band radar measurements are particularly\n\nsensitive to high-frequency components of the gravity field. It was therefore\n\ndecided to slow down the drift to roughly 3 km/day after reaching a separation of\n\n70 km and to collect data outside the nominal operational window of 220 ? 50 km.\nIn a trade-off between fuel expenditure and loss-of science data, a total drift\n\nduration of 2 weeks has been adopted by the project. The required drift rate of\n\n2 km/rev corresponds to a semi-major axis offset of 200 m and requires tangential a\n\nmaneuver of 11 cm/s.\n\nDuring the GRACEmission several orbit maintenance maneuvers were executed\n\nwith an accuracy of better than 5%. This performance results in an uncertainty of\n\nabout 8 h for the expected time of closest approach and makes a precise forecast of\n\nthe relative along-track position impossible. In such a situation an adequate separa-\n\ntion in cross-track and/or radial direction has to be ensured. One option would be to\n\nremove eccentricity vector difference to achieve a constant radial separation of both\n\nspacecrafts during the flyby. But with the planned Dv for the swap this was not\nfeasible. An additional velocity increment of four times of the planned would have\n\nbeen required. Therefore the e/i vector separation was selected in terms of cost and\n\noperational complexity. With this strategy the number of maneuvers had been\n\nminimized and a maximum level of passive safety was reached.\n\nDuring the swap period the relative inclination vector of the GRACE formation\n\nwas located at a phase angle of 90?, which implied that the two orbital planes\nintersected close to the north and South Pole of the Earth. The relative inclination at\n\nthat time resulted in a maximum cross-track separation of 360 m near the equator\n\ncrossing and remained nearly unchanged for the formation swap. Therefore an\n\nappropriate orientation of the relative eccentricity vector had to be used for a\n\n19 GRACE 571\n\n\n\nparallel e/i-vector configuration. Due to the rotation of the relative eccentricity\n\nvector with a period of 93 days as shown in (19.15) and Fig. 19.13, the parallel\n\nconfiguration was reached on Dec 10, 2005. This opportunity was selected for the\n\nclosest approach leading to a drift start maneuver on Dec 3, 2005. As also shown in\n\nFig. 19.13, the maneuver was used to increase the relative eccentricity in order to\n\nmaximize the radial separation between the two s/c during the proximity phase.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 19.15, the relative motion of GRACE2 w.r.t.

Its data will find wide application in geodesy, geophysics, hydrology, ocean\n\ncirculation and many other disciplines. The most appropriate measurement tech-\n\nnique identified for such mission is Low-Low Satellite-Satellite Tracking in which\n\ntwo (or more) satellites flying in \u201cloose\u201d formation in a low Earth orbit act as proof\n\nmasses immersed in the Earth gravity field. The distance variation between the\n\nsatellites (measured by a laser interferometer) and the non-gravitational\n\naccelerations of each satellite (measured by ultra-sensitive accelerometers) are\n\nthe fundamental observables from which the gravity field is obtained. Suitable\n\nsatellite formations for this mission include the \u201cIn-line\u201d (the simplest one), the\n\n\u201cCartwheel\u201d and the \u201cPendulum\u201d (more complex but also scientifically more\n\nfruitful), with an inter-satellite distance up to 100 km. Polar, circular orbits with\n\naltitudes between ~340 and ~420 km are suitable candidates for the NGGM,\n\nproviding all-latitude coverage, short repeat cycles/sub-cycles and a still excellent\n\ngravity signal compatibly with a long lifetime. Each satellite shall be endowed with\n\na complex control system capable of carrying out several tasks in close coordina-\n\ntion: orbit maintenance, formation keeping, provision of a \u201cdrag-free\u201d environment\n\nto the accelerometers, laser beam pointing and attitude control.\n\nS.

For example, Lageos 1 (launched in 1976) and\n\nLageos 2 (launched in 1992) allowed to obtain an accurate determination of the\n\nlowest coefficients (J2, J3, J22,..) of the expansion in spherical harmonics of\n\nthe gravity field and of their time variation, through the measurement of their\n\norbital trajectory by ground-to-space laser ranging.\n\nCHAMP [1], launched on July 2000, mapped the Earth gravity field using the\n\ntechnique of the Satellite-Satellite Tracking (SST) in High-Low mode (HL-SST).\n\nThe position of the satellite, which flew at an altitude <450 km, was accurately\ndetermined by means of the GPS network and processed for separating the orbital\n\ngravitational perturbations from the non-gravitational ones, the latter estimated\n\nfrom the measurements of an on-board accelerometer.\n\nGRACE [2], launched on March 17, 2002, proved the capability of detecting the\n\ntemporal variations of the Earth gravity field by exploiting the technique of\n\nSatellite-Satellite Tracking (SST) in Low-Low mode (LL-SST). The relative dis-\n\ntance between two satellites, flying in a pair along the same low orbit, is accurately\n\nmeasured by means of a K-band Ranging system. Again, the gravitational\n\nperturbations on the relative distance are separated from the non-gravitational\n\nones utilising the measurements of an accelerometer embarked on each satellite.\n\nGOCE [3] (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer), the first\n\nEarth Explorer Core Mission in ESA\u2019s Living Planet programme, launched on\n\nMarch 17, 2009 has provided the most accurate map of the static Earth gravity\n\nfield using the technique of the gradiometry. Three pairs of accelerometers arranged\n\nalong orthogonal axes (gradiometer) measure the differences of the gravitational\n\naccelerations between the points in which they are located, so providing the five\n\nindependent components of the gravity gradient (second spatial derivatives of the\n\ngravitational potential).\n\nSince 2003 the European Space Agency (ESA) has promoted studies to establish\n\nthe scientific requirements, to identify the most appropriate measurement\n\ntechniques, to start the associated technology developments, and to define the\n\nsystem scenarios for a \u201cNext Generation Gravity Mission\u201d (NGGM). This mission\n\nwill make use of Low-Low Satellite-Satellite Tracking between satellite pairs flying\n\nin loose formation on a low Earth orbit, with more advanced measurement systems.\n\nThe key requirements and issues related to the control of the satellite orbit,\n\nformation and attitude are addressed in the following chapters.\n\n20.2 Mission Objectives and Measurement Technique\n\nIn one of the preparatory studies for the NGGM [4] carried out by Thales Alenia\n\nSpace Italia (TAS-I) for the European Space Agency, with the contribution of some\n\nof the most prominent European institutes of geophysics and geodesy, a list of\n\n576 S. Cesare and G. Sechi\n\n\n\nscientific objectives was identified for this mission. They are provided in Table 20.1\n\nranked in order of priority. The associated spatial resolution and maximum Cumula-\n\ntive Geoid1 Error (CGE) requirements are in Table 20.2. To satisfy the requirements\n\nof the geophysical applications (solid Earth science, glaciology, hydrology, ocean-\n\nography, atmosphere circulation, etc.), the NGGM must provide the temporal\nvariations of the Earth\u2019s gravity field over a long time span (possibly covering a\ncomplete solar cycle: ~11 years) with high spatial resolution (comparable to that\nprovided by GOCE) and high temporal resolution (weekly or better), so as to reduce\nthe level of aliasing of the high frequency phenomena found in the time series of the\n\nEarth\u2019s gravity field variation provided by GRACE, and to improve the separability\n\nof the observed geophysical signals [5]. Moreover, the NGGM shall be able to\n\nprovide the following CGEs from monthly solutions of the Earth gravity field:\n\nTable 20.1 Fields of prioritisation for the NGGM with their spatial and temporal resolution and\n\napproximate signal magnitudes\n\nDescription Spatial resolution\n\nTemporal\n\nresolution\n\nSignal magnitude\n\nin geoid heights\n\n1 Melting of ice sheets (with\n\nseparation of glacial\n\nisostatic\n\nadjustment)\n\n100\u20131,000 km Seasonal 0.01\u20131 mm/year (secular)\n\nSecular\n\n2 Non-steric component\n\nof sea-level variations\n\nat seasonal and shorter\n\ntime scales\n\nGlobal to basin level Inter-annual 0.1 mm/year (secular)\n\nSecular\n\n3 Ground water (soil moisture\n\nand snow) at larger\n\nspatial scales\n\n10\u2013200 km Hourly 0.05\u20131 cm (seasonal)\n\nSeasonal\n\nSecular\n\n4 Post-seismic deformation 10\u2013200 km Sub-seasonal 1 mm (sub-seasonal)\n\nTable 20.2 Requirements in terms of maximum CGE for monthly gravity field retrievals\n\nResolution 10000 km 1000 km 200 km 100 km 10 km \n\nSpherical harmonic degree\n = 2  = 20  = 100  = 200\n\n  = \n2000\n\n10 mm     3   \n\n1 mm 2 4   CGE\n\n0.1 mm  1    \n\nThe numbers in the grey boxes correspond to the first column of Table 20.1.

This\n\ntechnique exploits the satellites themselves as the \u201cproof masses\u201d immersed in the\n\nEarth gravity field (Fig. 20.1). The fundamental observable is the distance variation\n\nbetween two satellites centres of mass (COMs) produced by the gravity accelera-\n\ntion, DdG, formally obtained as:\n\nDdG \u00bc Dd ? DdD (20.1)\n\n\u2022 Dd \u00bc total distance variation between the COMs, whatever the source,\nmeasured by a distance metrology,\n\n\u2022 DdD \u00bc distance variation produced by non-gravitational (i.e. drag) forces on the\nsatellite COMs along the line joining the COMs themselves:\n\nDdD \u00bc\n\u00f0 \u00f0\n\nD\u20acdD dt2; D\u20acdD \u00bc D1 ? D2 (20.2)\n\n\u2022 D1, D2 \u00bc non-gravitational accelerations of the satellite COMs, measured by\naccelerometer(s).\n\nThe measurement instrument formed by the satellite pair can be regarded as a\n\nkind of one-dimensional gradiometer with a very long baseline. Thanks to the\n\nseparation between the satellites it has a higher sensitivity for the phenomena of\n\ninterest than a gradiometer embarked on a single satellite, especially at altitudes\n\nhigher than GOCE\u2019s one, necessary for a long duration mission lifetime in order to\n\nFig. 20.1 Principle of the LL-SST technique for measuring the Earth gravity field\n\n578 S. Cesare and G. Sechi\n\n\n\ncompensate the drag forces with an affordable amount of propellant. In fact, the\n\ngravitational potential V of degree \u2018 rapidly decreases with the orbit radius r:\n\nV\u2018 / r?\u00f0\u2018\u00fe1\u00de (20.3)\n\nand therefore the instrument baseline must be proportionally increased in order to\n\nmaintain the same signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n20.3 Mission Outline and Satellite Formations\n\nThemission scenarios that have been devised by TAS-I [4] for theNGGMfeature one\n\nor two pairs of satellites. In all cases the satellite orbits are circular or nearly circular\n\nso that the signal of the Earth gravity field is nearly constant at the satellite altitude.\n\nIn the minimal scenario featuring one single satellite pair, the preferred orbit\n\ninclination is 90? (polar orbit), in order to avoid coverage gaps around the poles,\nwhich are undesirable for ice mass studies. In the scenario featuring two satellite\n\npairs, the inclinations providing the best spatial and temporal sampling of the Earth\n\ngravity field are 90? and 63? (Bender architecture [7]).\nThe mean orbit altitude of the satellite pairs shall be as low as possible (for\n\nmaximising the gravitational signal) compatibly with a lifetime of ~11 years (too\n\nlow an orbit would lead to an excessive amount of propellant for the atmospheric\n\ndrag compensation) and a repeat cycle of about 1 month with a sub-cycle of about 1\n\nweek [4] to get a fast and homogeneous coverage of the globe. For instance, polar\n\norbits with mean altitudes of 340 km (32/503 repeat with 7 and 4 day sub-cycles)\n\nand 424 km (30/463 repeat with 7 day sub-cycle) are both characterised by such\n\nrepeat cycles/sub-cycles and are potential candidates for the NGGM.\n\nThe formations, each constituted by a pair of satellites, can have typically three\n\nconfigurations:\n\n1. In-line (or Pearl String) formation (Fig. 20.2). This is the simplest formation\ntype (adopted by GRACE) in which the satellites follow the same orbital path,\n\nkeeping a relative distance nearly constant. The main limitation of the in-line\n\nformation is its strongly anisotropic sensitivity. Essentially, the inter-satellite\n\nranging data acquired by this mission contains information about gravity\n\ndifferences between the satellite locations. In an in-line formation on a polar\n\norbit (preferred inclination for single satellite pair) the satellites are located for\n\nmost of the time at nearly the same meridian. Consequently, the observations\n\ndescribe North\u2013south variations of the gravitational field (and mass transport)\n\nmuch better than East\u2013west variations. This anisotropic signal structure leads to\n\nthe well-known North\u2013south striations in the gravity field solutions obtained\n\nfrom the GRACE measurements. A significant gain in sensitivity and isotropy\n\ncan be achieved by adding to the polar in-line formation another in-line forma-\n\ntion at 63? inclination (Bender architecture).\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 579\n\n\n\n2. Pendulum formation (Fig. 20.3). This type of formation is obtained by\ncollocating the two satellites in two circular orbits with either slightly different\n\ninclinations or slightly different right ascension of the ascending nodes\n\n(RAANs). As a result, the satellite-to-satellite line performs a pendulum-like\n\nmotion in the X-Y plane of the mean Local Orbital Reference Frame (LORF,\n\nX \u00bc local horizontal, Z \u00bc local vertical, Y \u00bc local normal to the orbit plane)\nsynchronised with the orbital period. The angular amplitude of the oscillations\n\nis determined by the difference in inclination or RAAN. The pendulum\n\nformation mainly captures cross-track and along-track gravity signals and\n\nprovides higher sensitivity and isotropy in the gravity field solutions. For an\n\naperture angle of 45?, a single satellite pair in polar orbit provides a scientific\nreturn comparable to the Bender architecture consisting of two In-line\n\nformations.\n\n3. Cartwheel formation (Fig. 20.4). This type of formation is obtained by\ncollocating the two satellites on orbits with the same plane, same period and\n\nequal (small) eccentricity, with line of apsides coincident and perigee/apogee on\n\nopposite sides. As a result, the satellite-to-satellite line oscillates twice per orbit\n\naround the direction of the line of apsides (which maintains approximately the\n\nsame orientation in an Inertial Reference Frame) with amplitude of ~ ?20?. The\ntwo satellites appear to revolve around each other on elliptical trajectories (with\n\n2:1 ratio of the semi-major axes and period \u00bc orbital period) in a mean LORF of\na circular orbit having the same period as those of the satellites. The Cartwheel\n\nformation mainly captures radial and along-track gravity signals. It provides a\n\nscientific return similar to the Pendulum but leads to the most complex imple-\n\nmentation problems.\n\nFig. 20.2 In-line formation\n\ngeometry (S1, S2 \u00bc satellite\n1, 2; XO, YO, ZO \u00bc LORF\naxes)\n\n580 S. Cesare and G. Sechi\n\n\n\nThe cumulative geoid error achievable from 1 week and 1 month of\n\nmeasurements of the gravity field using the In-line (alone and in Bender architec-\n\nture), Cartwheel and Pendulum satellite formations is shown in Fig. 20.5 as function\n\nof the spherical harmonic degree. It was obtained from a detailed numerical\n\nsimulation [4], considering the following formation parameters:\n\nFig. 20.4 Cartwheel formation geometry and example of satellite relative trajectories in the mean\n\nLORF (XI, YI, ZI \u00bc Inertial reference frame axes)\n\nFig. 20.3 Example of pendulum formation geometry (obtained with inclination separation) and\n\nexample of the pendulum-like motion of the satellite-to-satellite line with ?45? amplitude in the\nmean LORF\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 581\n\n\n\n\u2022 Mean orbit altitude \u00bc 340 km for all the formations with the exception of the\nPendulum one, for which a higher altitude option (424 km) was assessed too.\n\n\u2022 Orbit inclination \u00bc polar for all the formations with addition of a 63? orbit for\nthe Bender architecture (with In-line formations), and the assessment of the sun-\n\nsynchronous inclination for the In-line formation alone.\n\n\u2022 Mean separation between the satellites \u00bc 75 km (in the Cartwheel formation the\ndistance varies between 50 and 100 km; in the Pendulum formation the distance\n\nvaries between 62 and 88 km and the maximum aperture angle is ?45?).\nFor a given measurement accuracy of the fundamental observables, the In-line\n\nBender architecture displays a good performance at the lowest spherical harmonic\n\ndegrees even after a single week of measurements (which can be explained by the\n\nmuch better and denser global coverage provide by the two pairs), but is even\n\noutperformed by the pendulum formation for degrees larger than about 20. The\n\nCartwheel and Pendulum formations (the latter also in the higher altitude version)\n\nprovide better performance than the In-line formation over measurements periods\n\nof 1 month.\n\nHowever, although the Cartwheel and Pendulum formations are advantageous\n\nfor gravity field determination, they impose high demands on satellite/instrument\n\ndesign, orbit/attitude control (including higher fuel consumption). Unlike the\n\nIn-line formation where the satellites keeps a fixed attitude in the LORF (so it\n\ncan be oriented with the minimum cross section towards the orbital velocity and the\n\ndrag force can be minimised), in the Cartwheel and Pendulum the orbital velocity\n\ndirection turns around the satellite and couples with a variable cross section giving\n\nrise to a higher drag force with wider dynamic range.\n\nMoreover, in the In-line formation one satellite keeps a nearly fixed position in\n\nthe reference frame of the other satellite, and can be easily tracked by the laser\n\nmetrology. In a Cartwheel formation with 100 km/50 km semi-major axes,\n\nthe relative distance changes with a variation rate up to ~57 m/s and the line\n\njoining the satellites oscillated by ~?20?. In a Pendulum formation with 75 km\n\nFig. 20.5 Cumulative geoid error for one week (left) and one month (right) of measurements\nrespectively\n\n582 S. Cesare and G. Sechi\n\n\n\nmean distance and ?45? oscillation angle of the line joining the satellites, the\nrelative distance changes with a variation rate up to ~30 m/s rate. These variations\n\nof the relative distance and angular position impose specific design requirements\n\nto the satellite-to-satellite ranging system (which has to cope with a significant\n\nDoppler shift) and to the attitude control (which must keep the laser beam pointed\n\ntowards a moving target). The Cartwheel formation is also affected by a number\n\nof problems arising from a non Earth-referenced attitude: the main component of\n\nthe drag force turns once per orbit around the satellite. Moreover, the inter-\n\nsatellite line becomes aligned to the satellite-Earth direction twice per orbit,\n\nwith potential interferences (optical and thermal) between the Earth radiation\n\nand the laser metrology.\n\nIn conclusion, the In-line formation is the easiest to implement (the scientific\n\nlimitations of a single In-line pair can be recovered by means of a Bender architec-\n\nture). The Pendulum is more complex but still viable if the maximum oscillation\n\namplitude is limited to 10?\u201315? (even with such small angle the scientific return is\nsuperior to the In-line case). The Cartwheel appears at the limit of feasibility.\n\n20.4 Payload Requirements and Design Outline\n\nAchieving the scientific objectives of the NGGM described in Sect. 20.2 requires\n\nthe capability of measuring the satellite-to-satellite distance variation Dd with the\nerror spectral density not exceeding the limit displayed in Fig. 20.6 [4].

Such requirement\nis within the reach of the accelerometers utilised in the GOCE mission [8].\n\nThe whole set of instruments concurring to the gravity field measurement in the\n\nNGGM is schematised in Fig. 20.8 and includes:\n\n\u2022 The laser interferometer, which measures the distance variation between two\n\nretro-reflectors installed ideally in the COMs of the two satellites.\n\n\u2022 A set of accelerometers, which measures the non-gravitational acceleration of\n\nthe COM of each satellite.\n\n\u2022 An auxiliary angle metrology, which provides the satellite orientation relative to\n\nthe satellite-to-satellite line (information needed for reporting the interferometer\n\nmeasurements from the retro-reflector position to the COM position, and for\n\nprojecting the acceleration measurements along the satellite-to-satellite line).\n\n\u2022 An auxiliary lateral metrology, which provides the lateral displacements of\n\nSatellite 2 (S2) relative to the laser beam emitted by Satellite 1 (S1) and feeds\n\nthe beam pointing controller via a radio-frequency inter-satellite link.\n\n\u2022 A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, which provides the\n\nprecise orbit determination and the relative position of the satellites (again the\n\nGNSS measurements are exchanged between S1, S2 via the inter-satellite link).\n\n\u2022 Star sensors, which provide the inertial attitude of the satellites.\n\n\u2022 A laser retro-reflector, for the precise orbit determination through laser ranging\n\nfrom ground (as complement to that provided by the GNSS receiver).\n\n1.0E-12\n\nre\nla\n\ntiv\ne \n\nac\nce\n\nle\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nm\nea\n\nsu\nre\n\nm\nen\n\nt e\nrr\n\nor\n d\n\n s\npe\n\nct\nra\n\nl d\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n1.0E-11\n\n1.0E-10\n\n1.0E-09\n\n0.0001 0.001 0.01\nfrequency [Hz]\n\n0.1 1\n\n[m\n/s\n\n2/\nsq\n\nrt\n(H\n\nz)\n]\n\nFig. 20.7 Upper limit to the measurement error spectral density of the non-gravitational relative\n\nacceleration (D\u20acdD)\n\n584 S. Cesare and G. Sechi\n\n\n\nThe core of the satellite-satellite distance variation measurement system is a\n\nMichelson-type heterodyne laser interferometer based on the retro-reflector scheme\n\n(laser transmitted by S1 and back-reflected by S2) and adapted for long-distance\n\noperation through an on/off amplitude modulation scheme (Fig. 20.9). Alterna-\n\ntively, a transponder scheme can be adopted in which the laser beam transmitted by\n\nS1 and received by S2 is \u201cregenerated\u201d by a second laser source locked in phase to\n\nthe incoming beam before being retransmitted towards S1.\n\nThe angle metrology consists of three small telescoped endowed with Position\n\nSensing Detectors and arranged on S2 in triangular configuration. Each telescope\n\npicks up a fraction of the laser beam transmitted by S1 and measures its incoming\n\ndirection that depends on the S2 orientation relative to the satellite-to-satellite line\n\n(materialised by the laser beam). The same three-telescope assembly measures the\n\noptical power of the intercepted portion of the incoming beam: the lateral\n\nangle/lateral\ndisplacement telescopes\n\nRR\n2\nPSD\n\n2\n\nPSD\n1\n\nPSD\n3\n\nSatellite 2\n\nSatellite 1\n\namplitude\nmodulated beam\n\nFrequency\nStabilistation\nSystem\n\nLaser source\nv0\n\nf1\n\nf2\n\nI1\n\nI2\n\nc2\n\nc1\n\np2\np1 p3\n\np4\n\npd2\n\nn0\n\nn2\n\nn2\n\nn1\n\nn1\n\nnm\nAMFS\n\nL\n\nn\u00a2m\nbs\n\ninterferometer\ntelescope\n\ninterferometer\ncore\n\nInterferometer\nTelescope\n\nRetro\nReflector\n\nInterferometer\nCore\n\npbs1\n\npbs2\npd1\n\nq1 RR1\nq2\n\nFig. 20.9 Interferometer functional scheme and configuration\n\nFig. 20.8 Instruments involved in the measurement of the LL-SST fundamental observables\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 585\n\n\n\ndisplacement of S2 from the axis of the laser beam is obtained from the unbalance\n\nof the optical powers. As the laser beam transmitted by S1 is modulated in\n\namplitude, by applying a synchronous demodulation scheme to the output of\n\neach detector it is possible to get rid of spurious signals caused by straylight.\n\nThe S1 orientation relative to the satellite-to-satellite line is obtained from the\n\nlateral displacement of S2 relative to laser beam axis and from the knowledge of\n\nthe absolute distance between the satellites (measured by the differential GNSS),\n\nas shown in Fig. 20.10.\n\nThe laser interferometer and the angle-lateral metrology device have been\n\ndeveloped by TAS-I in cooperation with INRIM, breadboarded and subjected to\n\nlaboratory tests that proved their potential capability to meet the NGGM perfor-\n\nmance requirements [9].\n\nAccelerometers like those utilised on GOCE can measure the non-gravitational\n\nacceleration of the satellite COM with the required precision. A minimum set of\n\ntwo accelerometers arranged like in Fig. 20.11 enables to locate the acceleration\n\nmeasurement point (mid point of the accelerometer centres) in the COM while it is\n\nphysically occupied by the laser retro-reflector. Moreover, besides the three linear\n\naccelerations of the COM, it provides the three angular accelerations of the satellite\n\nFig. 20.10 Measurement principle of S1 orientation (y1, f1) relative to the satellite-to-satellite\nline from the lateral displacement (DZ, DY) of S2 relative to laser beam axis\n\nUltra sensitive axis (US)\nLess sensitive axis (~0.01xUS)\n\nA4\n\nA2\n\nA2\n\nA3\n\nA1\n\nA1\n\nY\nY\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nX\n\nFig. 20.11 Arrangement of two accelerometers (left) and of four accelerometers (right).

Sechi\n\n\n\nwith the precision necessary for feeding the control of the angular dynamics (see\n\nnext chapter), either by combination of the linear accelerations measured by the two\n\naccelerometers or from the angular acceleration of the proof mass measured at\n\naccelerometer level. By increasing the number of accelerometers from two to four,\n\narranged like in Fig. 20.11, the additional measurement of two components of the\n\ngravity gradient (along two axes orthogonal to the satellite-to-satellite line) can be\n\nalso obtained, besides a more precise measurements of the linear and angular\n\naccelerations.\n\nThe laser interferometer core, its telescope, its retro-reflectors (two hollow\n\ncorner-cubes mounted back to back with coincident vertices) and the\n\naccelerometers are arranged in a common assembly sharing the same stable\n\nmechanical support and the same controlled thermal environment.\n\nThe same instrument assembly is replicated on both satellites. By so doing, if a\n\nfailure occurs on S1 preventing the interferometer operation, the mission can\n\ncontinue after having exchanged the position of the two satellites (i.e. S2 becomes\n\nthe active satellite).\n\n20.5 Preliminary Satellite Configuration\n\nThe preliminary configurations of the satellites defined by TAS-I along the NGGN\n\npreparatory studies [4] are shown in Fig. 20.12. The configurations were defined so\n\nthat two satellites can be launched together by a small launcher like Vega, Rockot,\n\nDnepr (two identical satellites back-to-back fill up the fairing).\n\nEach satellite is a slender prism with trapezoidal cross section with area of about\n\n1.3 m. For the In-line formation, this is also the area projected in the direction of\n\nmotion, so that the atmospheric drag force is minimised. For the other formation\n\ngeometries also the satellite lateral sides are periodically projected in the direction\n\nof motion and contribute to the drag cross section. The internal equipment layout is\n\nsuch as to place the satellite COM approximately in the geometrical centre, where\n\nFig. 20.12 Preliminary configurations of the NGGM satellite: with solar cells partly installed on\n\nthe satellite body (left) and installed on deployable wings only (right)\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 587\n\n\n\nthe payload bay is located. A slightly flared tube crosses the spacecraft from end to\n\nend to provide an unobstructed path to the laser beam.\n\nThe solar cells can be placed partly on the satellite body and partly on deployable\n\nwings, or on deployable wings only. Since the reference orbit of the NGGM is not\n\nsun-synchronous, it is necessary to track the seasonal variation of the sun aspect\n\nangle either by changing the orientation of the solar panels or that of the whole\n\nspacecraft: a rotation about the X axis (roll) is sufficient for maintaining a good\n\nillumination of the solar panels along the year. The latter solution is preferred since\n\nit avoids the presence of moving parts which displace the COM and disturb the\n\nmicro-vibration environment of the satellite.\n\nAll the satellite control functions are accomplished by means of electrical\n\npropulsion (selected for the low propellant consumption, as needed for a long\n\npermanence in low orbit), partially complemented by three magnetic torquers\n\nwhich supply torques around the satellite axes not aligned with the local direction\n\nof the Earth magnetic field. Actuators based on moving parts, like reaction wheels,\n\nhave been excluded since their mechanical noise is incompatible with the micro-\n\nvibration requirements imposed by the accelerometers. Two typologies of propul-\n\nsion system have been identified (see Fig. 20.13). The first one, more suitable to the\n\nlower orbit altitude (where the atmospheric drag force is larger) is characterised by\n\nthe use of thrusters of two different sizes: main thrusters (two for the In-line\n\nformation, four for the Pendulum formation), placed on the rear side of the satellite\n\nand oriented towards the COM for the compensation of the main component of the\n\ndrag along the X axis, and eight smaller lateral thrusters in the Y-Z plane (four on\n\nthe front side and four on the rear side) for the compensation of the lateral\n\ncomponents of the drag and for the satellite pointing.

Sechi\n\n\n\nthe same size of the lateral ones, arranged on the front and the rear sides of the\n\nsatellite and oriented so to provide forces and torques along and around each axis.\n\nThe electric thrusters must be capable to supply a force with variable amplitude,\n\nsimilarly to those utilised on GOCE, in order to precisely match the external\n\ndisturbances to be compensated so as to ensure a very quiet environment to the\n\naccelerometers. Potential candidates for the NGGM, for their size and performance,\n\nhave been identified in the mini radio-frequency ion thrusters (Mini-RIT) devel-\n\noped by the University of Giessen [10].\n\n20.6 Dynamics Control System for the NGGM\n\n20.6.1 Control Requirements\n\nEach satellite shall be endowed with a control system capable to carry out the\n\nfollowing tasks:\n\n\u2022 Maintenance of the orbit altitude for each satellite, compensating the decay\n\ncaused by the atmospheric drag force (the dominant non-gravitational force\n\nalong the satellite orbit).\n\n\u2022 Satellite formation acquisition and keeping along the mission, compensating the\n\ndifferential orbital perturbations on the two satellites.\n\n\u2022 Provision of a \u201cdrag-free\u201d environment to the accelerometers, consisting in\n\nattenuating the non-gravitational linear accelerations of the COM in absolute\n\nvalue and in spectral density (in a given spectral domain) below the limits\n\ncompatible with the accelerometer dynamic range and with the measurement\n\nperformance when coupled to the gradiometer imperfections (scale factors,\n\nsensitive axes misalignments and couplings) and accelerometer non-linearity\n\nremaining after the in-flight calibration.\n\n\u2022 Acquisition and maintenance of the fine pointing of the laser beam emitted by S1\ntowards S2.\n\n\u2022 Control the satellite attitude, and its angular accelerations and rates below the\n\nlimits established by the measurement performance of the satellite-to-satellite\n\ndistance variation (Fig. 20.6) and of the non-gravitational accelerations\n\n(Fig. 20.7).\n\nThe orbit altitude shall be controlled with the tolerance required to maintain\n\nthe established repeat cycle of the ground tracks as necessary for ensuring a\n\nhomogeneous coverage patters across the mission. In particular, the maximum\n\nseparation between the ground tracks of a repeat cycle and those of the succes-\n\nsive one shall be maintained within a fraction of the smallest spatial resolution\n\nto be achieved (see Sect. 20.2). A mean altitude control within a range of\n\nfew tens of metres, similar to that applied to GOCE, is compatible with the\n\nNGGM needs.\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 589\n\n\n\nNo stringent requirements apply to the two-satellite formation control if com-\n\npared with other formation flying missions. In fact, since in the LL-SST technique\n\nthe satellites themselves act as proof masses, they should be nominally free to move\n\nunder the action of the gravity field. In practice, the natural orbital perturbations (of\n\ngravitational and non-gravitational nature) if not controlled drive the satellites away\n\nfrom the initial formation geometry with consequences on the gravity field sam-\n\npling (e.g. due to the modification of the satellite-to-satellite baseline or of the\n\nmaximum aperture angle of the pendulum) and of the measurements (e.g. the\n\nsatellite-to-satellite distance can exceed the working range of the laser interferom-\n\neter). Thus, the satellite formation must be kept bounded around the initial\n\nparameters through a \u201cmild\u201d control action that shall not interfere with the scientific\n\nmeasurements (\u201cloose formation\u201d concept). In practice this means that the forma-\n\ntion controller shall operate with a bandwidth below the lowest frequency of the\n\nNGGMMBW (<1 mHz) and shall avoid as far as possible the introduction of non-\ngravitational linear accelerations occurring systematically at the same frequencies\n\n(e.g. the orbit frequency and multiples), which show up in the acceleration\n\nmeasurements as \u201charmonic\u201d errors superimposed to the random ones. Preliminary\n\nrequirements established for the In-line and Pendulum formation control are\n\nsummarised in Table 20.3.\n\nThe drag-free control applies to each satellite of the formation; its objective is to\n\nreduce the non-gravitational accelerations of the satellite COM below 10?6 m/s2\n\n(each axis) and its spectral density in the MBW below 10\u20138 m/s2/?Hz (for the\npayload composed by four accelerometers) or below 5 ? 10?9 m/s2/?Hz (for\nthe payload composed by two accelerometers), as shown in Fig. 20.14. Similarly\n\nto the non-gravitational linear accelerations, also the angular accelerations and the\n\nTable 20.3 In-line and Pendulum formation control requirements\n\nParameter Requirement Remark\n\nMaximum distance\n\nbetween the\n\nsatellites\n\n?100 km Set by the maximum working range of\nthe metrology\n\nAdmissible variation\n\nof the maximum\n\ndistance\n\n0 \u201310% Applicable to both In-line and Pendulum\n\nformations\n\nAdmissible variation\n\nof the maximum\n\naperture angle of\n\nthe pendulum\n\n?5?

Sechi\n\n\n\nangular rates of the spacecraft around the COM must be constrained in maximum\n\nvalue (?10?6 rad/s2 each axis, ?10?4 rad/s roll and yaw, ?1.2 ? 10?3 rad/s pitch\n\u00bc rate for Earth pointing attitude) and in spectral density in the MBW (?10?8 rad/\ns2/?Hz and ?10?6 rad/s/?Hz around each axis) in order to not impact the overall\nperformance in the measurement of the non-gravitational acceleration.\n\nThe attitude control of S1 is in charge of pointing the laser beam towards S2\nwith a precision ?2 ? 10?5 rad (defined by the optical link budget of the\ninterferometer) and with a stability ?2 ? 10?6 rad/?Hz down to a frequency of\n10 mHz (limit established by the error on the distance measured by the laser\n\ninterferometer produced by the coupling of the laser beam angular jitter with the\n\nfar-field wavefront distortions). The alignment precision of S2 with respect to\n\nthe laser beam can be relaxed up to 1? thanks to the use of the retro-reflector. The\npointing stability can be also relaxed to 10?5 rad/?Hz in the MBW (see\nFig. 20.14).\n\n20.6.2 Control System Preliminary Design and Performance\n\nThe main difficulty in the formation controller design is that the natural control\n\naction opposes the relative satellites motion that is the main observable for the Earth\n\ngravity field reconstitution. Moreover, the formation controller shall operate in\n\nsynergy with the drag-free control and shall minimise the additional thrusters\n\nforce and the propellant consumption. To avoidwasting propellant for compensating\n\nthe satellite relative displacements produced by the differential bias and\n\ndrift between the accelerometers which on each satellite feed the drag-free control,\n\nthese bias/drifts shall be estimated and removed from the command. On the other\n\nhand, to prevent that the drag-free control from cancelling out the formation control\n\naccelerations, the latter ones must be used as \u201creference\u201d in the drag-free loops. Of\n\ncourse, formation control accelerations must fulfil the drag-free requirements too.\n\n1.0E-06\n\n1.0E-05\n\n1.0E-04\n\n1.0E-03\n\n1.00E-04 1.00E-03 1.00E-02 1.00E-01 1.00E+00\n\nfrequency [Hz]\n\np\no\n\nin\nti\n\nn\ng\n\n s\nta\n\nb\nili\n\nty\n r\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nto\n t\n\nh\ne \n\nsa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n-s\nat\n\nel\nlit\n\ne \nlin\n\ne\nsp\n\nec\ntr\n\nal\n d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n li\n\nm\nit\n\n [\nra\n\nd\n/s\n\nq\nrt\n\n(H\nz)\n\n] Satellite 1\n\nSatellite 2\n\n1.0E-09\n\n1.0E-08\n\n1.0E-07\n\n1.0E-06\n\n0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1\n\nfrequency [Hz]\n\nC\nO\n\nM\n n\n\no\nn\n\n-g\nra\n\nvi\nta\n\nti\no\n\nn\nal\n\n li\nn\n\nea\nr \n\nac\nce\n\nle\nra\n\nti\no\n\nn\n s\n\np\nec\n\ntr\nal\n\nd\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n li\nm\n\nit\n [\n\nm\n/s\n\n2/\nsq\n\nrt\n(H\n\nz)\n]\n\n4 accelerometers\n\n2 accelerometers\n\nFig. 20.14 Upper limits on COM non-gravitational linear acceleration spectral density (left) and\non the satellite pointing stability relative to the satellite-satellite line (right)\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 591\n\n\n\nThe architecture of the control system designed to fulfil the performance\n\nrequirements and the above conditions is shown in Fig. 20.15. Each satellite has\n\nthree independent Linear Acceleration Controls (one for each axis) and the Relative\n\nPosition Control. A hierarchical control structure is implemented: the acceleration\n\ncommanded by the Relative Position Control is the reference acceleration profile\n\nwhich is tracked by the Linear Acceleration Control. This is necessary to avoid that\n\nthe Linear Acceleration Control cancels out the acceleration commanded by the\n\nRelative Position Control. In any case, the reference acceleration for the Linear\n\nAcceleration Control and its acceleration error shall meet the requirement on the\n\nresidual non-gravitational linear acceleration (magnitude and spectral density).\n\nThis means that the formation control action shall be limited in magnitude and\n\nshall be applied as much as possible at very low frequency.\n\nAt each control step (0.1 s), any drag-free control receives in input the accelera-\n\ntion commanded by the formation control, and the acceleration measurement; then,\n\nit computes the commanded forces to be applied by the thrusters assembly. The\n\nlinear acceleration control is realised as a linear acceleration observer, based on a\n\ndiscrete-time model of the disturbances to be attenuated and of the delay due to\n\naccelerometers and to thruster dynamics. By the observer, one-step-ahead predic-\n\ntion of the disturbance acceleration is computed. Figure 20.16 shows the sensitivity\n\nfunction of the Linear Acceleration Control on X and Y axes (cross-over frequency\n\nabout 0.3 Hz). This control design adopts the same approach as was followed for the\n\nGOCE Drag-Free and Attitude Control System [11, 12].\n\nFig. 20.15 Formation and drag-free control architecture\n\n592 S. Cesare and G. Sechi\n\n\n\nTo justify the formation control scheme it is necessary to recall some points and\n\nresults of the analysis. Starting from a given satellite relative position and velocity,\n\nthe formation geometry changes in time because of:\n\n\u2022 Differential perturbation due to Earth gravity field (non-spherical components\n\nlike J2, etc.), atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure.\n\n\u2022 Differential linear acceleration bias of the accelerometers introduced in the drag-\n\nfree control.\n\n\u2022 Non-exact initialisation of the state variables (relative position and/or velocity)\n\nin the control system.\n\nThe evolution of the formation geometry have been analysed for the In-line\n\nand Pendulum configurations, and it turned out that the major destabilising source\n\nis the differential acceleration bias that in few days can move the satellites far\n\naway from the initial geometry. From that, it is clear that the Relative Position\n\nControl shall embed at least the capability to estimate and to compensate the\n\ndifferential biases. The bias estimator shall be fast enough to follow the low\n\nfrequency drift of the accelerometers differential biases, and, at the same time,\n\nslow enough not to provide disturbances at the frequency relevant for the scien-\n\ntific mission.\n\nSince the Relative Position Control shall operate at low frequency (i.e. lower\n\nthan the orbit frequency), the model used to design the controller may be very\n\nsimple, without taking into account J2 effect, etc. The Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire\n\n(HCW) model (chief motion almost circular, differential effects related to J2,\n\n102\n\n100\n\n100 101\n\n10-2\n\n10-4\n\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\n\n10-6\n\n10-8\n\n10-10\n\nFrequency - (Hz)\n\nM\nag\n\nni\ntu\n\nde\n -\n\n (\ndB\n\n)\n\nFig. 20.16 Sensitivity function of the X and Y axes linear acceleration controllers\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 593\n\n\n\ndrag, etc. not taken into account) was considered sufficient for control synthesis.\n\nUsing the HCW model, it is possible to show that:\n\n\u2022 A residual bias along the X axis (along-track) is responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Relative position along X axis growing in quadratic way;\n\n\u2022 Relative position along Z axis growing in linear way;\n\n\u2022 A residual bias along the Z axis (radial) is responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Relative position along X axis growing in linear way;\n\n\u2022 Relative position along the Z axis remaining bounded with magnitude\n\ndepending on the applied bias.\n\n\u2022 A residual bias along the Y axis (across-track) does not destabilise the Y axis\n\nrelative position that remains bounded with magnitude depending on the applied\n\nbias.\n\nAs a consequence the proposed formation control for the observation phase\n\nbecomes very simple. Only the X axis (along-track) relative position is con-\n\ntrolled to maintain the formation geometry on a time horizon to be defined and\n\naddressed by simulation. The X axis Relative Position Control embeds the\n\ncapability to estimate the differential bias and provides compensation for it.\n\nThe radial (Z) and across-track (Y) degrees of freedom do not need any specific\n\ncontrol since a differential bias up to 2 ? 10?7 m/s2 (maximum value expected\nfrom GOCE-like accelerometers) induces an oscillation with amplitude equal to\n\n0.15 m, which is negligible with the formation initialisation error in the control\n\nsystem.\n\nThe design of the Relative Position Control was done following the same\n\napproach used for the linear acceleration control (state observer, disturbance\n\nmodel, etc.); the sampling frequency has been fixed to 0.1 Hz, but it may be still\n\nreduced. The relative position and velocity are measured with the required accuracy\n\nand noise by the differential GNSS technique. The commanded linear accelerations\n\ncomputed by any linear acceleration control, and the commanded angular\n\naccelerations required by the attitude control, are used to compute, at each control\n\nstep, the forces to be applied by the thrusters assembly.\n\nTo fulfil the specified requirements (in particular the spectral density limits of\n\nthe non-gravitational linear accelerations), it is necessary that all the control loops\n\nwork in linear condition. Saturations due to insufficient thruster force and/or drag\n\nforce below the minimum level applicable by the thrusters, are responsible for\n\nresidual accelerations with high frequency components. The performance that the\n\nthrusters of the various typologies (ref. Sect. 20.5) must provide in order to ensure\n\nthe implementation of all the control functions within the specified requirements are\n\nsummarised in Table 20.4 and Fig. 20.17.\n\nPerformance assessment has been done by extending the use of the GOCE End-\n\nTo-End (E2E) Simulator [13] to the case of two satellites. The E2E Simulator\n\nembeds very accurate and representative models for environment (MSIS90 atmo-\n\nsphere model for the computation of the air density, Hickey model for the\n\n594 S. Cesare and G.

An\n\nexample of obtained performance in the case of In-line formation with 75 km\n\nbaseline is shown in Fig. 20.18. Moreover, numerical simulations spanning a time\n\nperiod of more than 60 days have demonstrated the capability of the control to keep\n\nstable the geometry of the analysed formations (In-line and Pendulum).\n\nTable 20.4 Thrusters preliminary requirements\n\nParameter Main thrusters\n\nLateral thrusters,\n\nIn-line formation\n\nLateral thrusters,\n\nPendulum formation Unit\n\nMinimum thrust <0.1 0.05 <0.1 mN\n\nMaximum thrust >6 >1.0 >2 mN\n\nThrust resolution <4 0.5 0.5 mN\nThrust noise see Fig. 20.17 see Fig. 20.17 see Fig. 20.17\n\nRise/fall time <50 <50 <50 ms\n\nSlew rate >2 >0.25 0.5 mN/s\n\nUpdate command rate 10 10 10 Hz\n\nThrust non linearity <2% <2% <2%\n\nLifetime 11 years 11 years 11 years\n\nSpecific power <30 <40 <40 W/mN\n\nFig. 20.17 Upper limit to the thrusters force noise spectral density\n\n20 Next Generation Gravity Mission 595\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments The material utilised to write this chapter derives from the preparatory\n\nstudies for the NGGM promoted and funded by the European Space Agency and performed by\n\nThales Alenia Space Italia (team leader) with the contribution of the following sub-contractors/\n\nconsultants:\n\n\u2022 Deimos Space, Spain.\n\n\u2022 Delft University of Technology, Delft Institute of Earth Observation and Space Systems\n\n(DEOS), The Netherlands.\n\n[a] Relative position of S1 with respect to S2, provided in S2\n     body reference frame.\n[b] X-component of the relative position of S1 with respect to\n    S2, provided in S2 body reference frame (steady state).\n[c] Y and Z component of the relative position of S1 with\n    respect to S2, provided in S2 body reference frame (steady\n    state).\n[d] Time series of S1 linear acceleration in S1 body reference\n    frame (steady state).\n[e] One-sided spectral density of the S1 linear acceleration in\n    Satellite 1 body reference frame.\n\n-1\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\n1.95 1.955 1.96 1.965 1.97 1.975 1.98 1.985 1.99 1.995 2\n\nx106\n\nx104 x10\n4\n\nTime [s]\n\nx106 x105\n\nx107\n\nTime [s]\n\n1.95 1.955 1.96 1.965 1.97 1.975 1.98 1.985 1.99 1.995 2\nx106Time [s]\n\nTime [s]\n\nOne-side spectral density - Linear accelerations SAT1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nRelative position in Sat2 ref. frame Relative position in Sat2 ref. frame\n\nRelative position in Sat2 ref. frame Linear acceleration - SAT1\n\nX\nY\nZ\n\nX\nY\nZ\n\nX\nY\nZ\n\nX\nY\nZ\n\nX\nY\nZ\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \npo\n\nsi\ntio\n\nn \n[m\n\n]\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \npo\n\nsi\ntio\n\nn \n[m\n\n]\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \npo\n\nsi\ntio\n\nn \n[m\n\n]\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\n-80\n\n-100\n\n10-5\n\n10-5\n\n10-6\n\n10-7\n\n10-9\n\n10-8\n\n10-10\n\n10-4\n\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100 101\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nM\nag\n\nni\ntu\n\nde\n [m\n\n/s\n2 /\n\nH\nz0\n\n.5\n]\n\nM\nag\n\nni\ntu\n\nde\n [m\n\n/s\n2 ]\n\nreq\n\n8 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 9 9.2 9.4 9.6 9.8 10\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n7.45\n\n7.46\n\n7.47\n\n7.48\n\n7.49\n\n7.5\n\n7.51\n\na b\n\nc\n\ne\n\nd\n\nFig. 20.18 Synthesis of results about the formation and non-gravitational linear acceleration\n\ncontrol for the In-line formation\n\n596 S.

It consists of two spacecraft launched clamped\n\ntogether in low Earth orbit and separated in space after the commissioning phase\n\nin August 2010. The mission represents a unique in-orbit test-bed for guidance,\n\nnavigation, and control (GNC) algorithms, novel relative navigation sensors (GPS,\n\nradio-frequency, vision-based), as well as new propulsion systems (high perfor-\n\nmance green propellant, micro-electro-mechanical). Originating from an initiative\n\nof the Swedish National Space Board, PRISMA is run by OHB Sweden with\n\nimportant contributions by the German Aerospace Center, the French Space\n\nAgency, and the Technical University of Denmark. After a brief overview of\n\nmotivations, partners, and objectives, the chapter starts with a comprehensive\n\ndescription of the mission, including spacecraft platform, formation-flying and\n\nrendezvous sensors and actuators, as well as GNC key modes and algorithms.\n\nThe discussion is followed by a summary of the main project phases, including\n\noverall schedule, verification process, and mission operations. Actual flight results\n\nfrom the basic PRISMA mission and its numerous GNC experiments are presented\n\nalong with the achieved relative navigation and control accuracies over a broad\n\nrange of autonomous operations between 30 km and nearly zero inter-spacecraft\n\nseparation.\n\nS.

The expected benefits of these techniques have resulted in a virtual explosion\n\nof envisioned space assets. Although any attempt to list the missions under consid-\n\neration would be inevitably incomplete, the possible applications can be practically\n\nclassified in three major domains: space science, planetary science, and technology\n\ndevelopment. Related space science disciplines include solar system exploration,\n\nastronomical search for origins, structure and evolution of the universe. Distributed\n\nsatellite systems in low planetary orbits can augment and/or enable remote sensing\n\ntasks like digital elevation modeling, gravity recovery, and atmosphere characteri-\n\nzation. The technological development of space requires the capability to assemble\n\nstructures in orbit, to re-supply and repair orbital platforms, to capture and de-orbit\n\nspace debris. These are but a few of the applications which will take advantage of\n\nkey driver technologies like formation flying and on-orbit servicing.\n\nCommon to these classes of missions is the necessity to implement on-board\n\nautonomous guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) functionalities which are\n\ntraditionally performed in a ground-in-the-loop fashion. It is in particular this aspect\n\nwhich motivated the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB) and the Space Systems\n\nDivision of the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) (now OHB-SE) to conceive the\n\nPrototype Research Instruments and Space Mission technology Advancement\n\n(PRISMA) in late 2004 [4, 5]. PRISMA was established with the ambition to test\n\nin flight GNC software as well as sensor and actuator hardware technologies for\n\nformation flying and rendezvous of two co-orbiting satellites [6, 7]. After the\n\napproval of the basic funding by the SNSB in early 2005, the prime contractor\n\nOHB-SE established cooperation with a number of national and international\n\npartners to realize PRISMA. Potential participants were invited by the prime to\n\nshare mission time and resources in terms of self defined experiments as a compen-\n\nsation for the costs associated with specific software and/or hardware contributions\n\nto the project. Especially the German Aerospace Center (DLR/GSOC) and the\n\nFrench Space Agency (CNES) responded to the call and developed their own\n\nGNC software (integrated into the OHB-SE on-board software) in order to execute\n\ndedicated closed-loop experiments in orbit during the mission timeline.\n\n600 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\n21.1.2 Partners\n\nOHB-SE can be considered as prime contractor of the SNSB, and is responsible for\n\nthe overall design, build, and operations of the mission. The main partners of\n\nOHB-SE in the development and scientific exploitation of PRISMA are listed in\n\nthe following together with their key contributions:\n\n\u2022 The German Aerospace Center (DLR/GSOC) contributes the GPS absolute and\n\nrelative navigation system, comprising both the GPS hardware (Phoenix-S) and\n\non-board navigation software [8, 9]. DLR performs the Spaceborne Autonomous\n\nFormation Flying Experiment (SAFE), and the Autonomous Orbit Keeping\n\nexperiment (AOK) through dedicated software embedded in the overall GNC\n\nsoftware [10, 11]. Furthermore DLR is responsible for the precise orbit determi-\n\nnation (POD) on-ground verification layer [12].\n\n\u2022 The French Space Agency (CNES) contributes the Formation Flying Radio\n\nFrequency sensor (FFRF) and the associated software. Also the Spanish agency\n\nCDTI is involved in the development of the FFRF instrument. CNES performs\n\nautonomous formation flying experiments with dedicated software embedded in\n\nthe overall GNC software. The complete package is called Formation Flying\n\nIn-Orbit Ranging Demonstration (FFIORD) [13\u201315].\n\n\u2022 The Technical University of Denmark (DTU) contributes the Vision Based\n\nSensor (VBS) [16].\n\nOther partners in the project are listed below:\n\n\u2022 SSC/ECAPS contributes a novel High Performance Green Propellant (HPGP)\n\nmotor system developed as a replacement system for hydrazine [17].\n\n\u2022 SSC/Nanospace contributes a novel cold-gas Micro-propulsion motor system\n\nbased on MEMS technology [18].\n\n\u2022 Techno System Developments (TSD) in Naples, Italy, contributes a versatile\n\nhigh resolution color Digital Video System (DVS) [19].\n\n\u2022 The Institute of Space Physics (IRF) in Kiruna, Sweden, contributes a newly\n\ndeveloped mass spectrometer with a MEMS velocity filter [20].\n\nThe distribution of tasks and responsibilities in the project is depicted in\n\nFig. 21.1.\n\n21.1.3 Objectives\n\nPRISMA is primarily intended to demonstrate autonomous formation flying, hom-\n\ning and rendezvous scenarios, as well as close-range proximity operations.\n\nThe mission objectives are associated to specific experiment sets which\n\nstructure the mission timeline and operations [6, 7]. There are four operational\n\nand four equipment experiment sets which are described in Table 21.1. The closed-\n\n21 PRISMA 601\n\n\n\nloop orbit control experiments are conducted by OHB-SE, DLR and CNES over a\n\nwide range of separations and formation geometries. Each GNC experiment makes\n\nuse of one of the three relative navigation sensors available on-board (i.e., GPS,\n\nFFRF, and VBS). The hardware experiment sets include tests of the HPGP and\n\nMEMS experimental propulsion systems (SSC), the vision-based sensor (DTU),\n\nand the formation flying radio-frequency metrology sensor (CNES/CDTI).\n\nIn addition to the primary objectives of Table 21.1, the following several\n\nsecondary objectives have been defined:\n\n\u2022 Flight test of newly developed Data Handling System and Power Conditioning\n\nand Distribution Unit with battery management electronics (OHB-SE).\n\n\u2022 Act as model project for new model based development of on-board software\n\n(OHB SE).\n\n\u2022 Demonstrate Autonomous Orbit Keeping (AOK) of a single spacecraft (DLR).\n\nFig. 21.1 PRISMA partners and contributions\n\n602 S.

Mango features six degrees of freedom control\n\nthrough 3-axis attitude stabilization and 3D orbit maneuver capability independent\n\nof the spacecraft attitude. Attitude determination and control are based on star\n\ntrackers and reaction-wheels respectively. Orbit determination and control are\n\nTable 21.1 Summary of GNC related and hardware related experiment sets (primary objectives)\n\nGNC experiment set Description Separation (m) Key sensors\n\nAutonomous formation\n\nflying\n\nClosed-loop autonomous\n\nformation acquisition,\n\nkeeping, and reconfiguration\n\nusing various guidance\n\nand control laws\n\n5,000\u201320 GPS or FFRF\n\nHoming and rendezvous Autonomous approaches\n\nemulating assembly\n\nin space orbits and Mars\n\nsample return scenarios\n\n100,000\u20133 VBS\n\nPrecision 3D proximity\n\noperations\n\nTechnology demonstration\n\nusing forced motion\n\naround virtual\n\nstructures for on-orbit\n\nservicing, inspection\n\nand assembly\n\n100\u20133 GPS or VBS\n\nFinal approach and recede\n\nmaneuvers\n\nClose approaches to\n\ndemonstrate on-orbit\n\nservicing, inspection\n\nand assembly capabilities\n\n3\u20130 VBS\n\nHardware experiments Description Responsible\n\nHPGP (Green propellant) First flight demonstration\n\nand validation in orbit\n\nSSC/ECAPS\n\nMicropropulsion (Cold-gas) SSC/Nanospace\n\nFFRF (Radio frequency) CNES/CDTI\n\nVBS (Vision based) DTU\n\n21 PRISMA 603\n\n\n\nbased on three relative navigation sensors (i.e., GPS, FFRF, and VBS) and three\n\npropulsion systems (i.e., Hydrazine, HPGP, and Micro-propulsion) respectively.\n\nAlthough the aforementioned sensors and actuators are all alternatively used during\n\nexperimental phases, the primary relative navigation system is based on GPS\n\n(which is always active) and the main propulsion system is based on Hydrazine\n\nwith six thrusters and approximately 120 m/s delta-v capability. Electrical power\n\nfor the operation of the Mango spacecraft bus and payload is provided by two\n\ndeployable solar panels delivering a maximum of 400 W. The central body of\n\nMango has exterior dimensions 750 ? 750 ? 820 mm. When deployed, the dis-\ntance between the tips of the solar panels is 2,600 mm.\n\nThe Tango satellite has a simplified, yet 3-axis stabilizing, solar magnetic\n\nattitude control system and no orbit maneuver capability. The Tango body is\n\n570 ? 740 ? 295 mm. Tango relies on one body-mounted solar panel providing\na maximum of 40 W. Spacecraft operations rely on an S-band ground-to-space link\n\non Mango which supports commanding with a bit rate of 4 kbps and telemetry with\n\nup to 1 Mbps. In contrast, communication with Tango is only provided through\n\nMango which acts as a relay and makes use of a bidirectional Inter-Satellite-Link\n\n(ISL) in the Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) band with a data rate of 19.2 kbps.\n\nThe core of the data handling system (DHS) on Mango is the spacecraft\n\ncontroller based on a LEON3 microprocessor [21]. LEON3 implements a 32-bit\n\nprocessor compliant with the SPARC V8 architecture, which is particularly suited\n\nfor embedded applications. In contrast to its predecessor LEON2, LEON3\n\nrecognizes bit flips and is fault-tolerant. Its implementation through a field pro-\n\ngrammable gate array (FPGA) by Atmel Corporation provides a performance of\n\nabout 20 MIPS and accommodates one floating point unit (FPU). Communication\n\nbetween platform units and the spacecraft controller is implemented via a controller\n\narea network (CAN) bus. The PRISMA system is single failure tolerant in all\n\nessential functions. A Failure, Detection, Isolation and Recovery system (FDIR)\n\nhas been implemented which enables autonomous switching to redundant units in\n\nmost failure situations. Furthermore the FDIR system can detect potential collision\n\nor evaporation risk, and go to an inherently collision-free orbit through a minimum\n\nnumber of autonomous maneuvers.\n\nFigure 21.2 shows photos of the PRISMA flight models in split and combined\n\nconfiguration taken before launch in January and June 2010 respectively. For ease\n\nof identification the key sensing elements of the three available relative navigation\n\nsensors are indicated on the photos. The GPS antennas on Mango and Tango are\n\nnamed GPS-M and GPS-T. The FFRF antennas are named FFRF-M and FFRF-T.\n\nThe short- and far-range VBS cameras on Mango are named VBS-S and VBS-F\n\nrespectively.\n\n604 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\n21.2.2 Formation Flying and Rendezvous Sensors\n\nThe primary relative navigation sensor of the PRISMA formation is a GPS-based\n\nnavigation system developed by DLR/GSOC [9]. Relative GPS serves both as safe\n\nmode sensor of the formation to support FDIR tasks like collision avoidance and as\n\nnavigation source for the on-board feedback controllers to enable autonomous\n\nformation flying and rendezvous experiments. Furthermore in absence of\n\ninstruments characterized by higher technology readiness level, GPS serves also\n\nas true reference for sensor-cross validation, actuator characterization, GNC and\n\nexperiment accuracy evaluation. To this end the GPS raw data are processed\n\npost-facto on-ground by the Precise Orbit Determination (POD) facility of DLR/\n\nGSOC to routinely generate accurate daily products [12].\n\nThe GPS-based navigation system consists of a hardware architecture based on\n\nPhoenix-S receivers [8] which is identical on-board the two satellites and a naviga-\n\ntion software embedded in the Mango on-board computer for real-time absolute and\n\nrelative navigation. The GPS hardware is illustrated in Fig. 21.3. For redundancy\n\npurposes, each spacecraft carries two independent Phoenix-S GPS receivers that are\n\noperated in a cold redundant configuration. Increased flexibility for handling non-\n\nzenith attitude pointing is provided by two GPS antennas on each spacecraft, which\n\nare selected by an onboard algorithm for optimum GPS coverage or may, alterna-\n\ntively, be set by ground command.\n\nFig. 21.2 Flight models of the main satellite Mango (right-bottom), the target satellite Tango\n(right-top), and the combined launch configuration (left). The photos were taken in the SSC clean-\nroom in January 2010. The combined spacecraft was photographed in June 2010 during the\n\nmounting of PRISMA on the Russian Dnepr launcher\n\n21 PRISMA 605\n\n\n\nThe miniature Phoenix-S is a 12 channel single-frequency GPS receiver based\n\non a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware platform and qualified by DLR/\n\nGSOC for use in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The single-frequency (C/A, L1)\n\npseudorange and carrier phase measurements output by the receivers on Mango\n\nand Tango for each channel are combined in quasi-ionosphere-free observables and\n\nprocessed by the on-board navigation software on Mango through an Extended\n\nKalman Filter (EKF). A symmetric filter design has been chosen which adjusts the\n\nabsolute states of both spacecraft through rigorous numerical dynamics modeling\n\n[22]. The relative spacecraft state is simply computed by differencing the absolute\n\nstates (output at 1 Hz) without the need of an explicit relative motion model. The\n\naccuracy of the relative navigation is driven by the single-difference carrier-phase\n\nmeasurements, whereas the absolute navigation accuracy is driven by the noise of\n\nthe GRAPHIC measurements (i.e., average of pseudorange and carrier-phase).\n\nThe contribution of CNES to the PRISMA mission is the FFIORD experiment\n\n[15]. Its main objective is to perform a first in-orbit demonstration of the FFRF\n\nsubsystem. In its general configuration the FFRF instrument is intended to perform\n\ncoarse relative positioning of two to four satellites on formation flying missions. It\n\nproduces relative position, velocity and line-of-sight (LOS), as inputs to the GNC\n\nfunctions. The subsystem is composed of one FFRF terminal and up to four sets of\n\nantennas on each satellite of the formation. A set of antennas can be either a triplet\n\n(1 Rx/Tx master and 2 Rx slaves) or a single Rx/Tx antenna. Each S-band terminal\n\ntransmits and receives dual-frequency signals to and from all the other satellites\n\n(1 to 3) of the constellation in a TDMA based pattern. Ranging and angular\n\nmeasurements are extracted from received signals and are used for computing\n\nrelative position, velocity and line-of-sight. In addition to providing relative navi-\n\ngation measurements, the FFRF subsystem also provides an ISL as auxiliary\n\nFig. 21.3 Cold-redundant GPS hardware architecture based on Phoenix-S receivers identical on\n\nMango and Tango\n\n606 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\nfunctionality (12 kbit/s or 4 kbit/s). As depicted in Fig. 21.4, two configurations for\n\nthe FFRF terminal are available on PRISMA. On Mango, the FFRF terminal is\n\nconnected to a unique triplet antenna set, whereas the FFRF terminal is connected\n\nto three single Rx/Tx antenna sets on Tango.\n\nSimilar to GPS, the FFRF sensor can deliver two types of metrology information.\n\nThe RF raw data composed of pseudo-code, phase, delta-phase measurements from\n\neach terminal alongwith the clock bias between each terminal, and the relative position,\n\nvelocity and time for the companion satellite. The FFRF sensor is complemented by a\n\nnavigation function in the GNC on-board software which filters this latter\n\nnavigation solution in an EKF that includes direct modeling of the relative dynamics\n\nand performs measurement biases estimation [23]. In contrast to the GPS system\n\nemployed on PRISMA, the FFRF navigation approach avoids the processing of raw\n\ndata in the GNC software to reduce the complexity and computational load associated\n\nwith the RF signal filtering and the integer ambiguity resolution functionalities.\n\nThe contribution of DTU to PRISMA is based on the microASC, a fully\n\nautonomous miniature star sensor (c.f. Fig. 21.5) [24]. The microASC is designed\n\nfor highly flexible configurations and can host from one to four camera head units\n\nFig. 21.4 FFRF subsystem configuration on PRISMA (left) and FFRF terminal hardware (right)\n\nFig. 21.5 Star tracker and VBS subsystem configuration on Mango (left). Camera head and data\nprocessing instrument unit (right)\n\n21 PRISMA 607\n\n\n\n(CHU), located at suitable places and directions on a spacecraft, such that a fully\n\nredundant blinding free attitude sensor configuration can be achieved.\n\nOnboard PRISMA two CHUs are used as standard attitude reference sensors.\n\nTheir pointing directions are selected such that simultaneous blinding by Sun, Earth\n\nand the Tango spacecraft is avoided during the complex fly-around maneuvers. The\n\nthird port on the microASC is also equipped with a standard CHU. This CHU is\n\nhowever pointed in the forward direction, such that Tango can be seen in the field of\n\nview for most of the mission phases. The fourth port is equipped with a CHU with a\n\nmodified focal length, iris and electronic shutter, to enable operations at close range\n\nwith strong light conditions. These latter CHUs are used for vision-based naviga-\n\ntion of Mango with respect to Tango and are named VBS-Far and VBS-Short range\n\ncameras.\n\nThe VBS data processing is performed in the microASC, which is made possible\n\nby its huge spare processing power in standard operation. A description of the\n\nVBS can be found in Ref. [25]. The basic software has four different modes of\n\noperation:\n\n\u2022 Far range\u2014Stars and Tango both detectable in field of view.\n\n\u2022 Intermediate range\u2014Tango high brightness prevents detection of stars.\n\n\u2022 Cooperative short range\u2014Features of Tango discernible in field of view through\n\nfive LEDs mounted on each surface of the Tango body.\n\n\u2022 Non-cooperative short range\u2014Features of Tango obtained using natural illumi-\n\nnation from Sun and Earth albedo are matched to a 3D model database stored in\n\nthe microASC memory.\n\nIn short range mode both relative position and relative attitude (pose) informa-\n\ntion are output by the VBS subsystem for usage within the GNC software.\n\nFig. 21.6 Propulsion\n\nsystems embarked on the\n\nPRISMA mission\n\n608 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\n21.2.3 Propulsion Systems\n\nThe Mango satellite is equipped with a nominal hydrazine system, a HPGP system,\n\nand a Micro-propulsion system (c.f. colors red, green, and cyan in Fig. 21.6,\n\nrespectively). The hydrazine propulsion system has been chosen as the nominal\n\nsystem since both HPGP and Micro-propulsion represent new developments which\n\nare demonstrated in-orbit for the first time.\n\nThe hydrazine propulsion system consists of six 1-N thrusters directed towards\n\nthe Mango center of gravity, thus providing torque-free translational capability. The\n\npropellant tank contains 11 kg of usable fuel which gives approximately 120 m/s\n\ndelta-v over the mission. Firing times range from 0.1 s to steady state burns of up to\n\n2 min. The hydrazine system has been designed by OHB-SE based on procured\n\ncomponents from mainly US suppliers.\n\nThe HPGP motor experiment is a new propulsion system introducing environ-\n\nmentally friendly, non-toxic monopropellant ammonium-dinitramide (ADN) fuel\n\nwhich promises up to 10% better impulse and 30% higher density than hydrazine\n\n[26]. Indeed the performance in orbit has proved to be better than hydrazine in all\n\nmodes of operation. The HPGP propulsion system has two 1-N thrusters, also\n\ndirected towards the center of gravity. The system provides redundancy to the\n\nmain hydrazine system if any nominal thruster should fail. The propellant tank\n\ncontains 5 kg of usable fuel and gives approximately 60 m/s delta-v over the\n\nmission. The development, including the propellant itself and a compatible 1-N\n\nthruster and catalyst bed, is driven by ECAPS, a subsidiary company to SSC, and\n\nhas been supported by ESA for several years.\n\nThe Micro-propulsion system is based on MEMS technology and is developed\n\nby NanoSpace, a subsidiary of SSC, on contracts from ESA and SNSB [18]. It\n\ndelivers accurate thrust ranging from tenths of micro-Newtons up to milli-Newtons.\n\nThe system is a potential candidate for future missions where extremely low and\n\naccurate thrust is requested. The key component is a golf-ball sized thruster module\n\ncontaining a silicon wafer stack with four complete rocket engines with integrated\n\nflow control valves, filters, and heaters. Extremely small internal heaters inside the\n\nthrust chamber increase the performance of the system in terms of specific impulse.\n\nThe propellant is Nitrogen. The four thrusters are orthogonally distributed in the\n\nequator plane of the thruster module.\n\n21.3 GNC Experiments\n\n21.3.1 Classification and GNC Modes\n\nThe GNC experiments conducted by OHB-SE, DLR, CNES, and DTU during the\n\nPRISMAmission were intended to demonstrate closed-loop relative orbit control of\n\nMango with respect to Tango using different algorithms and sensors. The\n\n21 PRISMA 609\n\n\n\nexperiments were distributed over the mission length in a sequence with increasing\n\nlevel of complexity, to enable early harvest results for all parties at the beginning of\n\nthe mission. The overall experiment planning and design was under OHB-SE\n\nmanagement. DLR and CNES autonomous formation flying experiments were\n\nbased on their respective sensor system contributions (i.e., GPS and FFRF respec-\n\ntively). To this end, dedicated GNC software has been developed by these partners\n\nand embedded by OHB-SE in the GNC core software. The VBS-based experiments\n\nwere supported by DTU with the highly sophisticated functionality of the VBS\n\ncamera system.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 21.7, the backbone GNC modes are named Safe and AFF.\n\nThe Safe mode is entered by default upon reboot of Mango on-board computer, or\n\nin general upon reset of the platform. Furthermore the Safe mode is automatically\n\nset by the FDIR logic in case of contingencies related to the various subsystems\n\n(e.g., power, thermal, propulsion, GNC, etc.) and in the presence of high collision\n\nrisk with Tango. In order to handle these situations, the Safe mode itself is\n\nstructured in sub-modes like Safe-Sun, Safe-Celestial, and Safe-Orbit. Whereas\n\nSafe-Sun and -Celestial may be considered standard functionalities of an ACS\n\nsubsystem, Safe-Orbit is a unique multi-satellite feature which allows the execution\n\nof orbit control maneuvers to minimize the risk of collision with the co-orbiting\n\nspacecraft using relative GPS as navigation means.\n\nUnder nominal operations AFF is the only GNC mode that can be entered via\n\ncommand from Safe. AFF is considered the central node in the mode architecture\n\n(c.f. Fig. 21.7). All other experimental modes (e.g., DLR, CNES) can only be set via\n\ncommand upon transition from AFF which is also used as parking mode during the\n\nFig. 21.7 GNC modes diagram on Mango spacecraft\n\n610 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\npreparation of other experiments or during formation standby phases. Similar to\n\nSafe, AFF also makes use of GPS for relative navigation. The other GNC modes\n\ntrigger experimental functionalities and software implemented by DLR (DLR\n\nmode), CNES (CNES mode), and OHB-SE (PROX, ARV, FARM modes). In\n\naddition, a Manual mode is available to allow the ground to plan and command\n\norbit control maneuvers bypassing the autonomous functionalities. For complete-\n\nness, Table 21.2 offers an overview of the GNC mode functional configuration.\n\nEach GNC mode makes use of specific navigation and control functions. Whereas\n\nrelative GPS is used by most of the modes, FFRF and VBS are only used in CNES\n\nmode and by OHB-SE in ARV and PROX/FARM modes. Depending on the\n\nemployed algorithm and the desired control tracking accuracy the need for sparse\n\nor frequent orbit control maneuvers arises. The consequent thruster activations are\n\ntriggered by either an impulsive or a feedback control function which are described\n\nin the following.\n\n21.3.2 OHB-SE Modes and Key Algorithms\n\nThe GNC experiments under OHB-SE responsibility have been grouped in three\n\ndifferent modes: Autonomous Formation Flying (AFF), Proximity Operations and\n\nFinal Approach/Recede Maneuvers (PROX/FARM), and Autonomous Rendezvous\n\n(ARV). AFF demonstrates GPS-based passive formation flying. PROX/FARM\n\nincludes close-range forced-motion operations under geometric flight constraints,\n\nwhere either GPS- or VBS-navigation can be used. The FARM mode makes use of\n\nVBS only and is designed to represent the final stage of docking or similar physical\n\ndelivery. The capability to efficiently switch from passive relative orbits with sparse\n\nmaneuvering to forced-motion control with quasi-continuous thrust (and vice-\n\nversa) is also an objective of the OHB-SE experiments. ARV is designed to\n\ndemonstrate autonomous rendezvous capabilities from several kilometers distance\n\ndown to a few meters using VBS as the only navigation sensor.\n\nA detailed explanation of the applied algorithms can be found in Refs. [27, 28].\n\nThe AFF orbit guidance function uses passive target orbits up-linked from ground.\n\nTable 21.2 Simplified GNC mode functional configuration on Mango\n\nGNC modes\n\nFunctions used in closed-loop OHB-SE\n\nOrbit navigation Orbit control Responsible\n\nSafe GPS Impulsive OHB-SE\n\nAFF GPS Feedback OHB-SE\n\nManual \u2013 Impulsive OHB-SE\n\nDLR GPS Impulsive DLR\n\nCNES FFRF Impulsive or feedback CNES\n\nARV VBS Impulsive or feedback OHB-SE\n\nPROX GPS or VBS Feedback OHB-SE\n\nFARM VBS Feedback OHB-SE\n\n21 PRISMA 611\n\n\n\nThe guidance function can also generate its own passive target orbit upon autono-\n\nmous entry to AFF mode from a higher mode. In this case a \u201cclosest\u201d passive orbit\n\nis selected and the AFF mode acts as a higher safe or fallback mode. The AFF uses\n\nan orbit control function based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework\n\n[29]. The MPC function optimizes the next control request in terms of fuel\n\nconsumption based on orbit propagation over a number of future control points.\n\nThe orbit propagator is implemented for a general case of elliptic orbits using the\n\nYamanaka-Ankersen equations [30]. Fuel optimal solutions are obtained through\n\non-board solution of the associated simplex problems. The AFF experiment\n\nimplements relative orbits ranging from several kilometers down to distances\n\naround 10 m.\n\nThe PROX/FARM experiments consist of forced motion of Mango around\n\nTango at distances around and below 10 m. Mango navigates around a virtual\n\nstructure centered at Tango\u2019s position. The structure is designed to mimic a large\n\nspace structure such as the International Space Station (ISS) around which a flight\n\nmap is spanned. This flight map consists of a set of nodes with associated allowed\n\ntransitions. Based on the commanded transitions, the guidance function finds the\n\noptimal allowed path through the flight map by making use of an A* algorithm [31].\n\nThe orbit control in PROX/FARM uses the same framework as in AFF but with\n\ndifferent settings for propagation horizons and actuation frequency.\n\nThe ARV experiment demonstrates a complete autonomous rendezvous starting\n\nwith Mango approximately 25 km away from Tango. Mango maneuvers autono-\n\nmously down to a few tens of meters away from Tango ending the experiment with\n\na FARM maneuver that takes Mango to within less than 1 m from Tango. The final\n\nsteps make use of the PROX/FARM functions described above. Mango autono-\n\nmously locates Tango at far distance and then performs a series of orbit aligning,\n\nclosing, and homing maneuvers to finally get within a distance from Tango to allow\n\nfor the VBS to deliver explicit distance information so that handover to the PROX/\n\nFARM functions is possible. All of the maneuvers in the ARV are performed using\n\nVBS-navigation only and at far distances, these navigation functions are only based\n\non angular measurements.\n\n21.3.3 DLR Modes and Key Algorithms\n\nThe Spaceborne Autonomous Formation Flying Experiment (SAFE) and the\n\nAutonomous Orbit Keeping (AOK) experiments of DLR are conducted in the\n\nhomonymous DLR GNC mode.\n\nSAFE aims at demonstrating fuel-efficient long-term autonomous acquisition,\n\nkeeping and reconfiguration of passive relative orbits on a routine basis. To this end\n\na convenient parameterization of the relative motion in terms of relative orbital\n\nelements is employed. The guidance approach applies the method of relative\n\neccentricity and inclination vector separation to minimize collision risk and to\n\nincrease the passive stability of the formation under J2 perturbation [32]. Maneuver\n\n612 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\ndelta-v commands are computed according to an analytical impulsive feedback\n\ncontrol function which is characterized by a high level of determinism, and, through\n\nits negligible computational burden, is ideally suited for an onboard implementa-\n\ntion [10, 33]. A wide variety of formation geometries is exploited by the SAFE\n\nexperiment, spanning a range from 6 km down to a minimum separation of 30 m.\n\nAOK is designed to demonstrate on-board a single spacecraft the autonomous\n\ncontrol of the osculating Longitude of the Ascending Node (LAN) with an accuracy\n\nof 10 m (1s). The target trajectory for orbit control can be either up-linked from\nground as a set of desired LANs or generated on-board through numerical propa-\n\ngation. Similar to SAFE, the maneuver delta-vs are computed analytically but are\n\nrestricted to orbit corrections in velocity and anti-velocity directions [34].\n\n21.3.4 CNES Modes and Key Algorithms\n\nThe CNES FFIORD closed-loop experiments are executed in CNES GNC mode\n\nand make use of the FFRF metrology subsystem [15]. The main objectives are the\n\ndemonstration of autonomous rendezvous (RDV, 2MT), stand-by on relative orbits\n\n(SBY), and proximity operations capabilities (PROX) like, e.g., station-keeping at\n\ndifferent distances and offset positions from the orbit track, low speed translations\n\nin-plane and out of plane. Furthermore FFIORD includes collision avoidance (CA)\n\nexperiments. Each objective translates into a specific GNC function of the CNES\n\nflight software whose acronym has been indicated in brackets.\n\nA detailed explanation of the applied algorithms can be found in Refs. [35, 36].\n\nMost of the aforementioned orbit control functions apply the inverse state transition\n\nmatrix of Yamanaka-Ankersen to compute impulsive maneuvers (SBY, 2MT).\n\nForced-motion control along three axes in the vicinity of Tango is based on linear\n\nquadratic control with a typical period of actuation of 200 s (PROX). Safe rendez-\n\nvous or deployment from a distance of about 10 km to 100 m is based on a\n\nMPC-like method with fixed maneuvers dates and L2-norm criteria for the minimi-\n\nzation of the propellant consumption. The collision avoidance approach features\n\ntwo options which consist either in a relative drift between Tango andMango or in a\n\nproper phasing of radial and cross-track components to maximize the separation in\n\nthe plane perpendicular to the flight direction.\n\n21.3.5 Ground Verification Layer\n\nThe PRISMA POD facility is based on DLR\u2019s in-house GPS High precision Orbit\n\ndetermination Software Tools (GHOST). This software suite has been used rou-\n\ntinely to support many missions (e.g., GRACE, CHAMP, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X,\n\nPROBA-2) and has proved its high-readiness level as well as its ability to\n\n21 PRISMA 613\n\n\n\nprovide reliable and accurate orbit products. The data processing for precise orbit\n\ndetermination follows a four-stage scheme described in the following [37].\n\nFirst the raw GPS measurements are processed with the Single Point Positioning\n\nfor Low-Earth Orbit (SPPLEO) program to derive a kinematic navigation solution.\n\nThe output of the kinematic single point positioning is a discrete set of navigation\n\npoints affected by errors at the meter level. Second, this kinematic solution is\n\nfiltered dynamically using a batch least square process, called PosFit, which relies\n\non accurate models of the spacecraft dynamics. Third, a precise orbit determination\n\nis done using the previously computed coarse orbit solution for data editing. During\n\nthe data editing, the coarse reference is used to assess the quality of raw\n\nmeasurements and to select the healthy observations. The program for Reduced\n\nDynamics Orbit Determination (RDOD) implements a batch least-squares filter\n\nwhich processes ionosphere free combinations of pseudorange and carrier phase\n\nmeasurements (so called GRAPHIC measurements) to generate orbit products\n\naccurate at the meter level for single-frequency receivers. Finally, a filter for\n\nrelative navigation of satellites (FRNS) provides accurate relative positioning\n\nusing the precise orbit products of Mango and Tango as references for data editing.\n\nThe filter makes use of double difference carrier phase measurements to achieve\n\nultimate relative positioning accuracy. The double difference carrier phase integer\n\nambiguity is solved using the LAMBDA method [38].\n\nThe PRISMA mission offers many technical challenges for GPS based naviga-\n\ntion when compared with typical space missions [39]: complex and rapidly varying\n\nattitude profiles, dense thrusting activities, frequent switching of antennas. This\n\nunusual complexity makes the routine generation of precise orbit products difficult.\n\nThese considerations have triggered the implementation of an intermediate model\n\nbased on float ambiguity estimation. In this mode the carrier phase ambiguities have\n\nfloat values which are simply estimated as part of the state vector in the FRNS\n\nextended Kalman filter. This method is more robust but comes at the cost of a\n\ndegraded accuracy and is thus used only if the integer ambiguity cannot be applied\n\nsuccessfully.\n\n21.4 Project Phases\n\n21.4.1 Overall Schedule\n\nThe PRISMA project has been characterized by tight constraints in terms of time\n\nand costs throughout the complete life cycle. The original plan was drafted in 2005\n\nand foresaw a target project time of 3 years, aiming at a launch in summer 2008 [5].\n\nAs shown in Table 21.3 the actual schedule accumulated an overall delay of only 17\n\nmonths when the PRISMA spacecraft were finally ready to be shipped to the launch\n\nsite. The actual launch of the PRISMA satellites from Yasny, Russia was further\n\n614 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\ndelayed by approximately 6 months due to political and environmental problems\n\nassociated with the launch site itself and out of the control of OHB-SE.\n\nAccording to plan, the PRISMA Phase-B was concluded in November 2005 with\n\na Preliminary Design Review (PDR) after less than 1 year from project start. The\n\nPDR was followed by purchasing processes, detailed satellite design and produc-\n\ntion of engineering models of the satellite subsystems. The bench tests of engineer-\n\ning models in SSC laboratories took place in September 2006. The GNC system\n\nsimulations started in October 2006, whereas the vibration tests of the structural\n\nmodels were conducted in December 2006.\n\nThe Critical Design Review (CDR) milestone was successfully completed in\n\nJanuary 2007, less than 2 months behind schedule. This paved the way to the\n\ndelivery of flight hardware and experiments (also by the partners) in the time\n\nframe between June and December 2007 and to the Assembly, Integration, and\n\nTest (AIT) activities which were completed in April 2008. Advanced satellite\n\nsystem tests took place between May and October 2008, followed by environmental\n\ntesting (vibration, thermal, cycling, etc.) until February 2009. The AIT took place in\n\nthe clean room facilities at SSC engineering center in Solna. Environmental tests at\n\nsystem level were performed in Arboga near OHB-SE\u2019s premises and at Intespace\n\nin Toulouse, France. Figure 21.8 shows two photos taken during these activities\n\nwhich represent a radio test model of Mango mounted at the antenna test range in\n\nArboga (c.f. Fig. 21.8, left) and flight models of Mango and Tango in the sun beam\n\nof the space simulator at Intespace (c.f. Fig. 21.8, right).\n\nAfter a two-stage Flight Acceptance Review (FAR) in mid 2009, the PRISMA\n\nsatellites were declared ready for transportation to the launch site in November\n\n2009. Finally, PRISMA has been successfully launched aboard a Dnepr launcher\n\nfrom Yasny, Russia on June 15, 2010. The two PRISMA satellites were released,\n\nclamped together in launch configuration, into a nominal dawn-dusk orbit at a mean\n\naltitude of 757 km, 0.004 eccentricity and 98.28? inclination. The subsequent 2-day\nLaunch and Early Operations Phase (LEOP) signed the beginning of the first\n\ntechnology demonstration mission for autonomous satellite formation flying and\n\non-orbit servicing in Europe.\n\nTable 21.3 PRISMA project original and actual schedule\n\nProject milestones Original plan (as of 2005) Actual schedule (as of 2011)\n\nMission requirement review End of April 2005 End of April 2005\n\nSystem requirement review Mid of June 2005 Mid of June 2005\n\nPreliminary design review November 2005 November 2005\n\nCritical design review November 2006 January 2007\n\nFlight acceptance review March 2008 May 2009\n\nReady for shipment to launch site June 2008 November 2009\n\nLaunch from Yasny (Russia) Mid of 2008 15 June 2010\n\n21 PRISMA 615\n\n\n\n21.4.2 Verification Process\n\nAlthough the verification and test process has been similar to a single-satellite\n\nproject, new elements had to be considered which are specific to a multi-satellite\n\nmission, especially at system level [40]. The main test verification elements are\n\nlisted below:\n\n\u2022 A Structure Test Model (STM) has been used to qualify the new structure of both\n\nMango and Tango, the separation system between the two satellites, and the\n\npropulsion equipment.\n\n\u2022 A Bench Test Model (BTM) environment has been used to iteratively debug\n\ninterface problems and check basic functionality through a mixture of Engineer-\n\ning Model (EM) and Flight Model (FM) units connected to the EM data handling\n\nand power systems.\n\n\u2022 The SatLab software development and test environment.\n\n\u2022 The System Functional and Performance Tests (SFPT) environment.\n\n\u2022 The Environmental test campaign.\n\nThe software system tests took place in a real-time software validation facility\n\ndeveloped at OHB-SE, called SatLab. It consists of one EM of the computer board\n\nfor each of the spacecraft. The complete onboard software runs on a single\n\nFig. 21.8 Radio test model of Mango, geometrically correct and with real antennas, at the antenna\n\ntest range in Arboga, Sweden (left, Autumn 2007). Flight models of Mango and Tango in the sun\nbeam of the space simulator at Intespace in Toulouse, France (right, Early 2009)\n\n616 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\ncomputer for each of the satellites. In the real case, the boards are connected to the\n\nsensor and actuator interface electronics via a CAN bus. The SatLab environment\n\nincludes a simulator, SatSim [41], which simulates the interface electronics and\n\nincludes models of all on-board sensors and actuators, spacecraft attitude and\n\norbital dynamics, and space environment for both satellites.\n\nThe SFPT included series of open-loop and closed-loop tests performed on the\n\nflight model spacecraft. The tests were based on different test scenarios constructed\n\nto represent key phases of the mission such as the initial acquisition,\n\ncommissioning, and the different experimental phases. A number of test cases is\n\nexecuted within the framework of each scenario. The test cases are constructed to\n\nverify each on-board function used within the scenario. The whole test setup is\n\ncommanded and monitored over the UDP/IP network from the OHB-SE developed\n\ncommand and checkout software RAMSES [42]. This system is also used for flight\n\ncontrol during the PRISMA mission. The test cases are implemented as PLUTO\n\n(Procedure Language for Users in Test and Operations) test scripts. The whole test\n\nsetup is highly modular and can be configured to include anything from only some\n\nof the onboard hardware in the loop up to the complete on-board data handling\n\nsystem with all corresponding interface electronics. In the most complex configu-\n\nration, the setup includes platform unit simulators (PUSIMs) representing the\n\nFFRF-sensors as well as a DLR\u2019s RF GPS signal simulator (GSS) that can be\n\nused dynamically in closed-loop [43]. For this purpose, SatSim was modified to\n\nFig. 21.9 Integrated GNC closed-loop tests using Mango and Tango flight models with GPS\n\nhardware in the loop\n\n21 PRISMA 617\n\n\n\ntake an external time reference interrupt signal from the GSS. Figure 21.9 shows\n\nthis closed-loop test setup. The scenario based test approach is also constructed to\n\nbe highly modular so that the same test script can be used in several scenarios. Since\n\nRAMSES is also used in flight operations, several of the test scenario scripts have\n\nevolved into flight operational procedures.\n\n21.4.3 Mission Operations\n\nThe PRISMA mission operations concept is highly modular and flexible. The\n\nfunctional organization consists of a Mission Control Center (MCC) and several\n\nexperiment control teams (ECT). The MCC was located in Solna, Sweden at the\n\npremises of OHB-SE for most of the mission duration, whereas the ECTs were\n\nsituated at different locations around the world (e.g., DLR/GSOC, CNES, DTU).\n\nFor approximately 5 months, between March and July 2011, the MCC has been\n\ncloned and relocated at DLR/GSOC in an effort to support the mission, and prolong\n\nits lifetime. The temporary handover of the PRISMA mission operations to\n\nDLR/GSOC was successful thanks to the flexibility of the operations concept and\n\nthe long experience of DLR/GSOC which, at that time, was already operating the\n\nGRACE and TanDEM-X formation flying missions (c.f. Chaps. 19 and 13).\n\nThe MCC crew comprised one mission manager and up to three mission experts,\n\nwhile the experimenters were of variable number. As a baseline, mission operations\n\nwere conducted using the Esrange ground-station in Kiruna, Sweden, which\n\nprovided an average of ten contacts per day. As mission control center, DLR/\n\nGSOC managed to introduce additional ground stations in the loop, namely\n\nWeilheim in Germany and Inuvik in Canada. This allowed the planning of multiple\n\nand overlapping passages within the same orbit to achieve 30 min long contacts\n\nwith the spacecraft.\n\nThe PRISMA mission operations included the following three phases:\n\n\u2022 Launch and early operations (LEOP) and Commissioning phase (66 days).\n\n\u2022 Basic mission (388 days).\n\n\u2022 Extended mission (to end of mission).\n\nThe initial checkout of on-board equipment, the verification of essential on-\n\nboard functions, and the calibration of navigation algorithms such as attitude, rate\n\nestimators, and GPS navigation were conducted during the LEOP and\n\nCommissioning. As indicated in Table 21.4, during the first 66 days of the\n\nCommissioning Phase, PRISMA was operated as a combined spacecraft where\n\nTango was still mated to Mango. Given the knowledge of the relative position\n\nbetween the centers of mass of the two spacecraft, this phase provided a unique\n\nopportunity to verify the quality and accuracy of the precise GPS POD products\n\ngenerated post-facto on-ground. Most of the sensors and actuators embarked on\n\nMango got the opportunity to be powered on and to deliver the first data during this\n\nphase, including FFRF, DVS, and the propulsion systems.\n\n618 S.

S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\nAfter a 13-day preparation campaign, Tango was successfully separated from\n\nMango on August 15, 2010. This triggered a first GPS navigation calibration\n\ncampaign based on the reference POD. The careful tuning of the on-board naviga-\n\ntion filter took a few days and resulted in an update of the extended Kalman filter\n\nsettings. These were uploaded to the spacecraft and verified in the second GPS\n\ncalibration slot between August 27 and 29, 2010. The proper calibration of the GPS\n\nrelative navigation functionalities was followed by the verification of the central\n\nformation flying GNC modes, namely Safe and AFF, and by the official start of the\n\nBasic mission phase.\n\nAs of September 12, 2011, the Basic mission phase has come to an end (c.f.\n\nTable 21.4). All experiments needed to accomplish the primary mission objectives\n\nhave been successfully executed. The Mango and Tango spacecraft have been\n\nreconfigured for the different experiments mostly within the ISL range domain\n\n(<30 km). The minimum separation between the spacecraft (after separation) has\nbeen reached on January 25, 2011 during the GPS-based PROX/FARM-2 slot.\n\nDuring this experiment Mango approached autonomously Tango in forced motion\n\ncontrol from a distance of 20 m to hold a constant position in the orbital frame at\n\n2 m distance for about 5 min and then recede back to a safer orbit.\n\nThe maximum separation between Mango and Tango instead has been achieved\n\nat the end of the AOK experiment on August 16, 2011. In this phase Mango tried to\n\nmaintain its semi-major axis to track an external reference trajectory irrespective of\n\nthe motion of Tango. The resulting drift between the satellites induced an along-\n\ntrack separation of approximately 50 km after 30 days of operations.\n\nAll relative navigation sensors available on-board (i.e., GPS, FFRF, VBS) have\n\ndemonstrated the capability to support closed-loop control of the relative motion at\n\nvarious ranges of operations and with decimeter to centimeter level navigation\n\naccuracy throughout the mission.\n\nThe project has entered the Extended mission phase in September 2011, includ-\n\ning additional operational GNC experiments with old and new partners. The\n\nformation will evaporate at the end of this phase which includes also the final\n\npropellant depletion activities. For completeness, Table 21.4 shows the full\n\nPRISMA mission timeline as flown from June 15, 2010 to the end of the Basic\n\nmission on September 12, 2011. Each experiment slot is characterized by the\n\nActivity name (second column), a Start and Finish date (third and fourth column),\n\na Duration (fifth column), a Responsible for the experiment (sixth column) and the\n\nenvisaged Usage in terms of experiment slot precedence (last column). \u201cPrimary\u201d\n\nmeans that the Responsible has the responsibility of shaping the experiment in\n\nterms of relative orbit trajectory and if necessary also in terms of selecting the\n\nattitude profile of the Mango spacecraft. The Responsible organization has also full\n\ncontrol over the propellant usage during the experiment. In contrast, an experiment\n\nin Passenger mode is executed without any possibility to shape the experiment other\n\nthan by configuring an instrument to be on, a piece of software to be active, and/or\n\nsome telemetry packets to be enabled. These configurations must of course be\n\nwithin existing power, data handling, and downlink budgets.\n\n21 PRISMA 621\n\n\n\n21.5 Representative Flight Results\n\n21.5.1 Relative Navigation\n\nThe PRISMA GPS-based navigation system has been commissioned during the first\n\n2 months of the mission in the time frame between the launch of the satellites on\n\nJune 15, 2010 and the official start of the formation flying experiment timeline in\n\nAugust 2010. In the absence of an independent relative navigation sensor with\n\nsufficient technology readiness level and flight heritage, the characterization of the\n\non-board GPS navigation throughout the mission had to rely mainly on\n\ncomparisons with POD products generated post-facto on the basis of the same\n\nGPS data processed on-board. The strategy adopted to commission the GPS navi-\n\ngation system on PRISMA included three fundamental steps. First, the GPS hard-\n\nware system on Mango and Tango (c.f. Fig. 21.3) was checked out in terms of\n\nfunctionality, GPS signal acquisition and carrier-to-noise density levels. Secondly,\n\nthe capability and performance of the on-ground POD facility was verified when\n\nMango and Tango were still clamped in a combined configuration. Here, the known\n\nrelative position between the spacecraft center of mass served as a reference to\n\nevaluate the accuracy potential of the precise orbit determined on-ground. Finally,\n\nthe POD products gave the possibility to evaluate the real-time navigation errors\n\nand tune the on-board navigation filter in dedicated calibration efforts to obtain the\n\nbest trade-off between robustness and accuracy [44, 45].\n\nUp to the end of the Basic Mission, nearly 1.5 years of autonomous operations\n\nbased on on-board carrier-phase differential GPS has been completed and high\n\nnavigation performance could be demonstrated both in formation keeping with\n\npassive relative orbits as well as proximity operations with forced motion control.\n\nMoreover the cross-comparison of relative GPS with other experimental relative\n\nnavigation sensors embarked on PRISMA (i.e., FFRF and VBS) has led to a\n\ncentimeter accurate calibration in orbit of novel RF and optical metrology systems\n\nwhich are considered as key technologies for future multi-satellite missions.\n\nFigure 21.10 provides the typical navigation accuracy obtainable through\n\ncarrier-phase differential GPS on the PRISMA mission. As compared with the\n\nPOD product, the relative position and velocity errors are about 5.12 cm and\n\n0.21 mm/s (3D, rms) respectively and thus well below the formal requirement of\n\n0.2 m and 1 mm/s defined at the beginning of the mission. It is noted that the tuning\n\nof the navigation filter plays a key role in the achievable accuracy, and especially\n\nthe weights of measurement noise and a-priori standard deviation of the empirical\n\naccelerations have to be carefully considered. As an example the filter settings\n\napplied during the considered scenarios introduce relative large empirical\n\naccelerations in radial direction as compared to the other components. The resulting\n\nloose constraint on the relative dynamics causes larger errors in radial direction, but\n\nis shown to be beneficial for the absolute orbit determination accuracy which\n\namounts to 2 m and 7.5 mm/s (3D, rms) for position and velocity respectively.\n\n622 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\nMore results on the demonstrated accuracy of the GPS-based relative navigation\n\nsystem are presented in Sect. 5.4.3.\n\nThe FFRF sensor and the related navigation functionalities were checked-out,\n\nvalidated, and tuned throughout the mission in a progressive approach through\n\nPassenger experiments, and Primary experiments in open- and closed-loop (c.f.\n\nTable 21.4). First flight results of the FFIORD experiment have been presented in\n\nRef. [46]. The navigation performance has been evaluated for ranges between 20 m\n\nand 30 km through the systematic comparison of on-board relative position and\n\nvelocity estimates with the post-facto on-ground POD products. Several GNC\n\nfunctions (i.e., RDV, CA, SBY, PROX, c.f. Sect. 21.3.4) and distance ranges\n\n(from 7 km in RDV down to 20 m in PROX) have been exercised to complete\n\nthe characterization of the sensor throughout mission representative operations. The\n\nevaluated navigation accuracy spans a range between a few centimeters (3D, rms)\n\nduring PROX at 20 m separation, up to a few meters cross-track error during RDV\n\nactivities from 7 km. During formation separation, the cross-track error builds up to\n\n12 m at 30 km range whereas the in-plane error does not exceed 1 m (2D, rms) and\n\nthis illustrates the strong link between performance and orbital dynamic axes\n\ncoupling. As expected, the angular errors do not change significantly in the different\n\nGNC modes (~0.1?), but it is rather the relative position error that is amplified by\nthe increase of range. The main performance limiting factor has been identified as\n\n2011/03/19\u2013250\n\u2013200\n\u2013150\n\u2013100\n\u201350\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n\n\u2013250\n\u2013200\n\u2013150\n\u2013100\n\u201350\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n\nR\nad\n\nia\nl [\n\nm\nm\n\n]\n\n-27.86+/-28.40mm\n\n2011/03/19\n\n\u2013250\n\u2013200\n\u2013150\n\u2013100\n\u201350\n\n50\n0\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n\nA\nlo\n\nng\n-t\n\nra\nck\n\n [m\nm\n\n] 6.32+/-25.21mm\n\n2011/03/19\n\n19.Mar 6h 12h 18h 20.\n\n19.Mar 6h 12h 18h 20.\n\n19.Mar 6h 12h 18h 20.\n\nGPS Time\n\nC\nro\n\nss\n-t\n\nra\nck\n\n [m\nm\n\n] -7.02+/-17.87mm\n\nFig. 21.10 Difference of real-time on-board navigation solution versus post-facto on-ground\n\nprecise orbit product for PRISMA on March 19, 2011. Orbit control maneuvers for autonomous\n\nformation control are indicated by vertical lines.

A specific complexity of FFRF-based naviga-\n\ntion is represented by the initialization and initial convergence procedures. As\n\ndemonstrated in orbit, after completion of the integer ambiguity resolution process\n\nand the estimation of a first relative state through least squares filtering, the EKF\n\nreaches steady state accuracy in typically half an orbit (3,000 s) in the absence of\n\norbit control maneuvers.\n\nThe VBS sensor was commissioned as a Passenger experiment in the time frame\n\nbetween August and November 2010 (c.f. Table 21.4). A brief in-flight characteri-\n\nzation of the VBS-Far camera functionality can be found in Ref. [47]. In Far range\n\noperational mode (c.f. Sect. 21.2.2), the VBS processing unit is able to isolate a\n\nsingle object from the VBS-Far images, identify it as the target satellite, and\n\nprovide a line-of-sight vector in either the camera body mounted frame or\n\nthe inertial reference frame. The latter information is only available if the inertial\n\nspacecraft attitude can be determined from visible stars in the same image.\n\nA comparison of the sensor output with the POD reference for large separations\n\n(~10 km) provided a typical match to within 5\u201310 arcsec for target intensities below\n\n10,000 Data Numbers (DN), with peaks up to 40\u201380 arcsec for larger intensities.\n\nAssuming a POD accuracy at the decimeter level (2 arcsec), and considering the\n\ntight correlation of the error pattern with the target intensity, the primary sources of\n\nerror in this comparison are believed to be the knowledge of the camera orientation\n\nand field of view errors of the VBS attitude measurements. Peaks in the intensity are\n\nproduced by Sun light flashes under specific orientations of reflective items. Both\n\nfunctionality and performance deteriorate when the size of the target becomes\n\nFig. 21.11 VBS-Short range camera images on October 7, 2011 at 20 m inter-spacecraft separa-\n\ntion (top).

At 50 m separation the delivered line-of-\n\nsight switches between several body features (e.g., radiators and antennas),\n\nintroducing systematic errors of over a degree. Despite the identified limits and\n\nreduced robustness, autonomous approaches based on VBS-Far navigation were\n\nsuccessfully performed from 5 to 30 km to delivery points at hundred meters\n\nseparation (c.f. Sect. 21.5.3). Typical images collected in orbit using the VBS-Far\n\nand -Short range cameras are shown in Fig. 21.11.\n\nThe potential of the VBS-Short camera has been fully exploited in June 2011\n\nduring the PROX/FARM VBS five experiment slot (c.f. Table 21.4). Here precise\n\nFig. 21.12 Difference of real-time on-board VBS navigation solution (filtered) versus on-board\n\nrelative GPS (blue), post-facto on-ground POD (red line), and VBS sensor measurements output\n(gray) on June 9, 2011. Overall navigation consistency at the centimeter level is obtained during\nforced motion control at 10 m separation of Mango from Tango\n\n21 PRISMA 625\n\n\n\nstation-keeping of Mango is performed at 10 m along-track separation from\n\nTango. Figure 21.12 illustrates the comparison between the on-board VBS-\n\nbased navigation filter output with both the post-facto on-ground POD and the\n\non-board relative GPS navigation. In addition, also the difference between VBS\n\nKalman-filtered and non-filtered on-board solutions is shown. First of all, the plot\n\ndemonstrates a consistency between VBS and reference POD at the centimeter\n\nlevel. Small offsets in radial and cross-track directions (c.f. Fig. 21.12, red line)\n\nare most probably due to uncertainties in the VBS-Short camera orientation and\n\nthe phase center position of the GPS antennas on Mango and Tango. Secondly,\n\nduring this scenario, the performance of optical navigation is shown to be better\n\nthan the on-board relative GPS (c.f. Fig. 21.12, blue line). The degraded GPS\n\nrelative navigation solution (30 cm maximum error) is due to the heavy maneu-\n\nvering activity, corresponding to thrusters activations every 50 s. Indeed the\n\non-board GPS orbit determination relies on the knowledge of the systems dynam-\n\nics and can hardly incorporate delta-v maneuvers at a frequency similar to the\n\nsample time of the extended Kalman filter (30 s).\n\n21.5.2 Propulsion Systems\n\nResults from the in-space flight demonstration of the HPGP propulsion system are\n\ndescribed in Ref. [48]. The commissioning of the propulsion system took place on\n\nJune 23\u201324, 2010, 8 days after launch. The first firing sequence was a pulse train of\n\nforty 100 ms pulses at a duty cycle of 1%. The maneuver estimated by the DLR\u2019s\n\nPOD ground facility confirmed a total delta-v variation of 2.1 cm/s and the HPGP\n\nwas thus declared ready for operations.\n\nSince then, all planned firings of the propulsion system have been successfully\n\ncompleted and calibrated through GPS precise orbit determination. On September\n\n9, 2011 a 75 s continuous firing was performed, the longest yet with a HPGP\n\nthruster in space. The accumulated number of pulses exceeded 50,000, 63% of the\n\npropellant has been consumed through a total of 363 fire sequences. After 15 months\n\nin space, no indications of degradation have been observed and the flight demon-\n\nstration has evolved into an actual space flight qualification.\n\nThe HPGP propulsion system has been operated in several operational firing\n\nmodes, from Quasi Steady-State (continuous firing) to Pulse Mode (duty factors\n\nbetween 0.15% and 50%), from Off-Modulation (duty factors between 50% and\n\n99%) to Single Pulse (very low duty factors).\n\nThe HPGP thruster performance measured in space is coherent with the\n\nmeasurements performed on ground in the near vacuum test stand. Back-to-back\n\nin-space comparison between the HPGP and hydrazine propulsion systems shows\n\nsuperior specific and density impulse for the HPGP. The comparison is performed\n\nat comparable thrust levels. For Quasi Steady-State the improvement over hydra-\n\nzine specific impulse is 6% and 12% respectively at begin and end of life. In Single\n\nPulse mode the improvement over hydrazine is 10% and 20% respectively, whereas\n\n626 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\nin Pulse Mode the HPGP and hydrazine performance are comparable. A theoretical\n\nimprovement of 6% was expected between HPGP and hydrazine performance,\n\nhowever the back-to-back in space comparison demonstrates higher performance\n\nin most cases.\n\nThe Micro-propulsion experiment has been conducted in August 24\u201328, 2010.\n\nThe experiment consisted in demonstrating cold gas micro-thrusters in the mN\n\nrange, with highly innovative thruster design etched in silicone wafers and with\n\nminiaturized gas management system. This flight demonstration represented the\n\nonly PRISMA set-back. When commissioning the system, involving opening up\n\nof the miniaturized latch-valve between the gas tank and the pressure regulator and\n\nthrusters, it appeared as though the pressure had disappeared. The suspicion that\n\nthis actually could have happened had already been raised during the early\n\ndays of the mission. During one 24 h period, 2 days into the mission, a strange\n\nbehavior of the onboard momentum management function indicated an external\n\ntorque on the system. The temperature of the Micro-propulsion tank dropped\n\nslightly in the beginning of this period. Moreover, empirical accelerations\n\nestimated by the precise on-ground orbit determination process matched suspi-\n\nciously the expected effects of a gas leakage. Despite the anomaly, the micro-\n\npropulsion team managed to demonstrate that the thruster hardware and control\n\nelectronics functioned as expected, opening and closing micro-valves and manag-\n\ning thermal control in the thruster pods. Hundreds of cycles have been commanded\n\nto the individual thrusters and telemetry data showed nominal signatures of\n\nvoltages, currents and temperatures. Unfortunately, this potential success could\n\nnot be manifested in a real thrust demonstration due to the lacking tank pressure.\n\nThe Micro-propulsion experiments were stopped on August 28, 2010.\n\n21.5.3 Closed-Loop Orbit Control Experiments\n\nFlight results from the GNC experiments conducted by OHB-SE during the\n\nPRISMA mission have been presented in Refs. [47, 49, 50]. Here a brief summary\n\nof the achievements from the usage of the three dedicated modes (i.e., AFF, PROX/\n\nFARM, and ARV, c.f. Sect. 21.3.2) is provided. AFF represents the only GNC\n\nmode on-board PRISMA that after the experimental phase has been used on a\n\nroutine basis for an extended period of time. AFF has accumulated over 4 months of\n\nclosed-loop cooperative satellite formation-flying time. About 20 days have been\n\ndedicated to AFF experiments, while the rest has been operational routine\n\nformation-flying, where AFF has been used to support other experiments based\n\non GPS navigation.\n\nOver 110 different formation reconfigurations have been performed so far. The\n\noperational range has been from 30 km down to 10 m. Figure 21.13 summarizes\n\nthe complete AFF usage in PRISMA between August 2010 and April 2011.\n\nThe illustration is not intended to provide details of the individual trajectories,\n\nbut rather to provide a fair visualization of the operational range of autonomous\n\n21 PRISMA 627\n\n\n\nGPS-based formation flying activities tested during PRISMA. In contrast to the\n\nimpulsive and sparse orbit control activities of AFF, PROX/FARM operations\n\nconsist of forced-motion flight of Mango around Tango in the ranges from about\n\n50 m down to 2 m. The forced motion is either directly around Tango or around a\n\nvirtual structure defined about the Tango spacecraft. The purpose of the virtual\n\nstructure is to mimic the circum-flight about a large object with appendages and no-\n\nfly zones, such as the ISS or the Hubble space telescope.\n\nFig. 21.13 Autonomous Formation Flying (AFF) trajectories flown byMango w.r.t. Tango during\n\nthe PRISMA basic mission (Adapted from Ref. [49])\n\nFig. 21.14 Flight trajectory (right) and corresponding control tracking errors (left) based on POD\n(blue) and on-board GPS navigation (green) on February 3, 2011. Red vertical lines represent on-\nboard thruster\u2019s activations. An image of Mango has been superimposed in correct scale right next\n\nto the trajectory arc B (Adapted from Ref. [49])\n\n628 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\nRepresentative flight results from a virtual inspection tour of the ISS are\n\nillustrated in Fig. 21.14. Compared to other flown scenarios, here the required\n\ndelta-v to track a quickly changing and highly non natural trajectory is much larger\n\n(i.e., 0.97 m/s in 2.4 orbits with 98 thrusts) and poses challenges in terms of GPS-\n\nbased navigation, non-convex guidance optimization, and non-linear controller\n\nbehavior.\n\nThe applied MPC box for this scenario is 0.5/1.0/0.5 m respectively in radial/\n\nalong-track/cross-track, whereas the control period is set to 150 s. As shown in\n\nFig. 21.14, the achieved control tracking errors remain within the prescribed control\n\nbox most of the time with a performance of approximately 0.5 m (3D, rms) when\n\ncompared with a reference POD.\n\nFinally two key experiments were performed by OHB-SE in ARV mode to\n\ndemonstrate autonomous rendezvous with a passive non-cooperative target using\n\noptical line-of-sight navigation in April and November 2011 [47]. The ARV mode\n\nconsists of an initial search for the target, a subsequent centering of this target in the\n\nfield of view of the VBS-Far camera, several orbital revolutions of angle-only orbit\n\ndetermination, a first alignment of the two orbits to a specified control tolerance,\n\nand the final along-track approach to the delivery point from target.\n\nEach of these functionalities has been exercised in orbit leading to errors of ca.\n\n1\u20132 km in the on-line estimation of the range from target after three orbits of on-\n\nboard orbit determination at 30 km separation. The subsequent alignment and\n\norbit closing phases led to a reduction of the range estimation error to below 5 m\n\nat a representative 50 m separation delivery point. The major challenge faced by\n\nthe ARV experiment has shown to be the robustness against false or erroneous\n\nsensor data at all ranges of operations. Special attention had to be paid to\n\nincorrect first detections of target in the field of view at large separations and\n\nto systematic line-of-sight errors due to reflecting features of Tango at small\n\nseparations.\n\nFlight results from the SAFE closed-loop experiment executed by DLR in\n\nSeptember 2010 and March 2011 are discussed in Refs. [44, 51]. SAFE has\n\ndemonstrated the capability of the DLR\u2019s GNC subsystem to establish, maintain,\n\nand reconfigure arbitrary baselines in space in full autonomy for future remote\n\nsensing applications employing formation flying spacecraft. The applied impulsive\n\nrelative orbit control scheme has been shown to be fuel efficient and passively safe.\n\nMoreover the adopted parameterization in terms of relative eccentricity and incli-\n\nnation vectors facilitated all mission phases, from the GNC design, analysis, and\n\nimplementation, all the way to experiment planning, operations, and post-facto\n\nevaluation. A total of 22 different formations have been prescribed via\n\ntelecommand during the 35-days flight experiment which have all been smoothly\n\nacquired and accurately maintained without ground-intervention. The formation\n\ngeometries span a wide range and are characterized by mean along-track\n\nseparations between 0 and 5 km, and oscillation amplitudes in radial and cross-\n\ntrack direction between 0 and 400 m. A minimum separation of 20 m between\n\nMango and Tango was acquired and maintained through anti-parallel relative\n\neccentricity/inclination vectors on Match 21, 2011.\n\n21 PRISMA 629\n\n\n\nThe average duration of fine formation keeping for each configuration was 13.4\n\norbits (22.3 h) for a total of 294.7 orbits (20.4 d) or ca. 58.3% of the experiment\n\nduration. The maneuver cycle for in-plane control or the distance between consec-\n\nutive pairs of maneuvers was two orbital revolutions in average. The demonstrated\n\nformation keeping accuracies spanned a range from 1.1/1.7/0.1 m in Radial/Along-\n\ntrack/Cross-track directions at ca. 100 m separations to 30.6/38.0/1.4 m at 5 km\n\nalong-track distance. Representative control tracking errors during formation main-\n\ntenance are depicted in Fig. 21.15 and are clearly dominated by second order\n\nrelative dynamics effects which are neglected by the adopted relative motion\n\nmodel.\n\nFormation reconfigurations were characterized by average convergence times in\n\ncross-track direction of 1.2 orbits, and two cross-track maneuvers were in general\n\nsufficient to obtain any desired correction of the relative inclination vector. The\n\naverage convergence time in radial and along-track directions is correlated and\n\namounted to 2.4 orbits for the relative eccentricity vector. Typically 2\u20133 pairs of in-\n\nplane maneuvers were sufficient to enter the fine formation keeping phase. Mean\n\nalong-track reconfigurations required longer convergence times of 3.7 orbit\n\nrevolutions in average. The total commanded delta-v during SAFE amounted to\n\n38.58 cm/s for formation keeping and 2.63 m/s for formation reconfiguration.\n\nTypical images collected in orbit during the SAFE fly-around and inspection\n\nphase using the DVS camera are shown in Fig. 21.16.\n\nThe AOK experiment represented the DLR\u2019s secondary mission objective (c.f.\n\nSect. 21.3.3). It was executed successfully from July 18 to August 16, 2011, and\n\ndemonstrated precise autonomous absolute orbit control of a single spacecraft.\n\nFig. 21.15 Control tracking errors during maintenance of similar formations through pairs of\n\nradial (top) and along-track maneuvers (bottom) (Adapted from Ref. [51])\n\n630 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\nThe main performance requirement was a control accuracy of 10 m (1s) on the\nLAN with a maneuver budget constraint of 0.5 m/s. The position and velocity\n\nvector of Mango at 01:00 UTC on July 18, as estimated by the GPS based POD\n\nprocess, have been taken as initial state for the generation of the reference orbit. In\n\na first phase of the experiment, AOK demonstrated reference orbit acquisition\n\ncapability reducing gradually the LAN deviation from 300 m to within the\n\nprescribed control window. After the convergence phase, at steady-state, the\n\ncontrol accuracy requirement was fulfilled with slight margin. The mean value\n\nof the LAN error controlled by AOK was ?3.6 m with a standard deviation of\n9.5 m during the fine control phase. The total delta-v spent during the entire\n\nexperiment was 0.1347 m/s.\n\nA comprehensive discussion of the FFIORD closed-loop results based on\n\nFFRF navigation is available in Refs. [52, 53]. Overall the CNES\u2019s objectives\n\nin terms of functional behavior and performance have all been achieved through\n\n12 days of experiment operations and a total delta-v allocation of 6 m/s. The\n\nrendezvous (RDV) activities cover six approaches from distances of 4\u20137 km to a\n\nfew hundreds meters and one deployment from 600 m to 5 km. The single\n\nrendezvous durations and delta-v consumptions covered a spectrum from 7 to\n\n14 orbits and from 27 to 9 cm/s respectively. Typical rendezvous accuracies at\n\nthe delivery point stayed below 10 m and 10 mm/s with propellant consumption\n\nin line with expectation values obtained from ground simulations. The standby\n\nFig. 21.16 Fly-around/inspection of Tango on March 27, 2011 during SAFE experiment. Inter-\n\nspacecraft separations between 30 and 60 m. 75 s image rate. DVS camera\n\n21 PRISMA 631\n\n\n\nfunction (SBY) was activated during 40 orbits for an overall cost of approxi-\n\nmately 7 cm/s. The demonstrated formation keeping accuracy amounts to a mean\n\nof 30 cm in cross-track direction and to a few meters in radial and along-track\n\ndirections. A total of four successful collision avoidance (CA) maneuvers have\n\nbeen performed with the Mango relative trajectory exiting the prescribed keep-\n\nout-zone a few seconds after the maneuver. The ultimate navigation and control\n\naccuracy obtained in the FFIORD experiment has been demonstrated by the\n\nproximity operations activities (PROX). In order to remove the limitation given\n\nby the minimum impulse bit of the propulsion system (i.e., 100 ms thruster burn\n\ntime), PROX featured a so-called sub-pulse mode where the thrusters were\n\noperated in a differential way to realize the requested inputs. Station keeping at\n\n80 and 20 m separations has been exercised with quasi-continuous activations of\n\nthe thrusters (200 s control cycle). As depicted in Fig. 21.17, navigation and\n\ncontrol errors based on the reference POD showed accuracy at the centimeter\n\nlevel in both bias and standard deviation. Although an ideal fixed relative\n\npointing of the FFRF sensor has been imposed to mitigate temperature induced\n\nFig. 21.17 Control tracking errors based on POD (blue) and on-board FFRF navigation (red)\nduring PROX activities performed at 20 m distance on March 11, 2011 with sub-pulse mode\n\nactivated\n\n632 S. D\u2019Amico et al.\n\n\n\nbiases, these GNC accuracies are probably the best that have been achieved\n\nduring the PRISMA mission so far.\n\n21.6 Conclusion\n\nThe growing interest in autonomous formation flying and on-orbit servicing\n\ntechnologies is demonstrated by the deployment in orbit and by the successful\n\nflight demonstrations of the last years. The ETS-VII experiment initiated the trend\n\nin 1997 with a first validation in low Earth orbit of rendezvous and docking\n\ntechniques. Orbital Express went a step further in 2007 by demonstrating rendez-\n\nvous, inspection, and servicing capabilities. TanDEM-X was launched in 2010 and\n\nconstitutes nowadays the first synthetic aperture radar interferometer involving two\n\nformation flying spacecraft at distances down to few hundred meters.\n\nIn this context, with its start in June 2010, PRISMA represents the most recent\n\nand significant step in the advancement of formation flying and rendezvous\n\ntechniques. The originality of the mission stems from the integration of a large\n\nvariety of navigation and guidance algorithms along with new sensors and\n\nactuators, and from the implementation of numerous flight tasks within complex\n\noperational scenarios in a fully autonomous manner. In addition to the technologi-\n\ncal breakthrough, PRISMA represents an international success, thanks to its multi-\n\nlateral nature with contributions and independent experiments conducted by OHB-\n\nSE, DLR, CNES and DTU.\n\nAfter more than 1 year in orbit, all primary and secondary objectives of PRISMA\n\nhave been achieved, and valuable results have been collected in various disciplines\n\nwhich are now under further and deeper investigation. As a matter of fact, PRISMA\n\ncan be considered as a mission of many firsts. From a relative navigation point of\n\nview, PRISMA flies the first GPS differential carrier-phase-based real-time naviga-\n\ntion system (SAFE), the first RF based relative metrology subsystem (FFRF), and a\n\nnovel vision-based relative navigation system (VBS) in closed-loop. Cross-\n\ncomparisons between relative navigation sensors and post-facto on-ground precise\n\norbit determination have demonstrated real-time navigation accuracies at the sub-\n\ndecimeter level even during frequent orbit maneuvering activities.\n\nFrom an actuation perspective, PRISMA embarks the first high performance\n\ngreen propellant propulsion system (HPGP), which has been demonstrated to be\n\nsuperior to hydrazine by 6\u201310% in specific impulse at similar thrust levels. Novel\n\nmicro-electro-mechanical propulsion technology has also been shown to function\n\nas expected in orbit, even though a leakage of the cold-gas tank prevented an actual\n\nthrust demonstration.\n\nPRISMA has shown to be an ideal test bench for formation guidance and control\n\nalgorithms. It is the first time that arbitrary passive relative orbits are controlled\n\nautonomously on-board making use of relative orbital elements and in particular\n\nrelative eccentricity and inclination vectors. Furthermore novel model predictive\n\ncontrol schemes based on the Yamanaka-Ankersen equations have been flight\n\n21 PRISMA 633\n\n\n\nproven for the first time during sparse orbit maneuvering, forced-motion quasi-\n\ncontinuous control, and collision avoidance activities. Algorithms for autonomous\n\nrendezvous of a servicer vehicle with respect to a passive non-cooperative target\n\nusing only optical line-of-sight measurements have also been demonstrated during\n\nthe mission.\n\nOverall PRISMA has shown that the major phases of a complete formation\n\nflying mission in low Earth orbit can be autonomously performed using state-of-\n\nthe-art sensors while assuring centimeter-level positioning accuracy. Functional\n\nbehavior and performances are fully consistent with what is expected from a first-\n\nstage metrology system. Potential next customers for these technologies are either\n\ncooperative formation flying projects like PROBA-3 (ESA), or non-cooperative on-\n\norbit-servicing missions like DEOS (DLR). In the former case, GPS, FFRF, and\n\nVBS metrologies are to be implemented for formation acquisition, maintenance and\n\ncollision avoidance whereas optical metrology will take over for precision\n\nmaneuvers. In the latter case, both GPS and VBS relative navigation metrologies\n\nare possible candidates to support experiment validation, monitoring, and collision\n\navoidance on one hand (GPS) and autonomous rendezvous to a non-cooperative\n\ntarget on the other hand (VBS).\n\nFlight data and user experience acquired during the PRISMA experiments are a\n\nmost valuable resource for the design of the navigation approach and for the\n\nprediction of related performances. Using the vast collection of data available in\n\nvarious scenarios, representative measurements can be provided for typical\n\ntrajectories and performances inferred via simulation. Whatever their actual utili-\n\nzation in the coming years, the PRISMA achievements have brightened the future\n\nof formation flying by breaking a psychological barrier: maintaining satellites in\n\nclose vicinity has been demonstrated in a routine manner with limited ground\n\nsupport and at reasonable cost. Lessons learned will therefore provide useful\n\nguidance for future multi-satellite projects.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

FAST shows the potential of a first international micro-\n\nsatellite formation flying mission in three distinct fields: technology demonstration,\n\nearth science and space education. Here, the FAST mission is presented. The\n\nmission scenario consisting of different formation flying stages is described, and\n\nthe system design of both the space and the ground segments is introduced, with\n\nemphasis on Dutch contributions. Some key technical issues related to autonomous\n\nformation flying are also addressed.\n\n22.1 Introduction\n\nSpace missions consisting of multiple small satellites flying in formation are now\n\noften considered as a feasible and logical alternative to the traditional approach of\n\nusing a large and complex monolithic spacecraft. Important arguments in favour\n\nof space missions with Formation Flying (FF) satellites are improved spatial\n\ncoverage, enhanced functionality, risk mitigation, flexibility, and reduced space-\n\ncraft complexity.\n\nAn example of the opportunity arising from the usage of small satellites flying in\n\nformation is provided in this chapter. The information results from the Formation\n\nfor Atmospheric Science and Technology demonstration (FAST) mission, a joint\n\nproject that was initiated in 2007 between Delft University of Technology (TUD) in\n\nThe Netherlands and Tsinghua University in China [1].\n\nJ.

The primary mission objectives, which are all equally important, are:\n\n\u2022 Demonstrate Autonomous Formation Flying (AFF) by means of various com-\n\nmunication architectures, distributed propulsion systems and Micro Systems\n\nTechnologies (MSTs);\n\n\u2022 Characterize atmospheric aerosols, monitor the variation of height profiles in the\n\ncryosphere, and correlate these data for improved scientific return; and\n\n\u2022 Teach cutting-edge technology, broaden the international view of students and\n\nboost skills through the exchange of students and staff.\n\nIn this chapter the details of the FAST mission are presented. The rest of the\n\nchapter is organized into five parts. The first part describes the mission scenario,\n\nhighlighting different formation flying phases and operational modes. The second\n\npart details the system design of both the space and the ground segments, with\n\nemphasis on Dutch contributions. The third part describes scientific applications of\n\nthe FAST mission, including the characterization of atmospheric aerosols, the\n\nseasonal variation of height profiles in the cryosphere, and the correlation between\n\nthe two. The forth part deals with key technical issues related to autonomous\n\nformation flying. Design challenges related to systems engineering, inter-satellite\n\nlink, distributed computing, and cooperative control are addressed. The fifth part\n\nbriefly discusses the educational opportunities of the FAST mission.\n\n22.2 Mission Scenario\n\nThe baseline orbit for the two satellites, i.e. FAST-D and FAST-T, is a sun\n\nsynchronous orbit (SSO) at 650 km altitude with a local time of the ascending\n\nnode (LTAN) of approximately 10:00 h. The satellites are foreseen to be launched\n\nas piggyback payloads on a Chinese launcher. Each satellite has been assigned a\n\ntotal velocity change (DV ) budget of 12 m/s. This includes a 100% contingency to\nallow for failure of the propulsion system on one of the satellites [2]. The 2.5 years\n\nmission is divided into three phases, each with a distinctly different orbital geome-\n\ntry [3]. The rationale for and the orbital geometry during these phases are treated in\n\nthe following.\n\n22.2.1 Phase 1: LEOP and Initial Commissioning\n\nThe first mission phase is the Launch and Early Operations Phase (LEOP),\n\nwhich consists of the launch, orbit insertion, detumbling, acquisition of a safe\n\nattitude pointing mode, and establishment of two-way communications with the\n\nground stations. After LEOP, the 1 month long initial commissioning phase starts.\n\n640 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\nIn this phase the satellites will not fly in formation, thus allowing differential\n\naerodynamic drag to cause a large along-track separation of the two satellites. The\n\ncurrent estimate for the along-track separation distance after 1 month is 60 km,\n\nrequiring a bang-bang formation initialization maneuver costing 0.2 m/s to start the\n\nnext mission phase.\n\nDuring the initial commissioning phase the individual satellite subsystems and\n\npayloads will be tested and calibrated. The characterization of the attitude control,\n\ndifferential GPS, inter-satellite communication, and propulsion subsystems are of\n\nvital importance to allow transitioning to the next mission phase.\n\n22.2.2 Phase 2: Technology Demonstration\n\nDuring technology demonstration mode, cf. Fig. 22.1, the two satellites will\n\ndemonstrate the ability to autonomously maintain an along-track separation of\n\n1 ? 0.1 km by means of Autonomous Formation Flying (AFF) using propellant\noptimized distributed propulsion. This capability requires a propulsion system on\n\neach spacecraft as well as an inter-satellite communication link. For solar maxi-\n\nmum conditions, it will take the satellites slightly over 1 day to traverse the 200 m\n\ncontrol window of this mission phase. To maintain the desired formation geometry,\n\ntaking into account differential drag only, a DV of 2 mm/s is then required to bring\nthe inter-satellite distance back to the other extreme of the control window.\n\nAlthough the orbital geometry is not optimized for it, some first science\n\nobservations will be performed during this phase of the mission. Due to the\n\nrelatively small inter-satellite distance, this phase also lends itself well to perform\n\ndistributed computing experiments between the two spacecraft and to perform\n\ncross-calibration between the instruments on the different spacecraft. The AFF\n\ndemonstration will be performed for several weeks and will be followed by a\n\ntransition to the required relative geometry for the science phase.\n\nFig. 22.1 The technology\n\ndemonstration phase\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 641\n\n\n\n22.2.3 Phase 3: Science Observation\n\nIn this mission phase, the along-track separation between the satellites will be\n\n1,225 ? 5.7 km, as shown in Fig. 22.2. Since natural drift of the formation will\nrequire approximately 100 days before this geometry is achieved, preference is\n\ngiven to a controlled maneuver requiring a total DV of 2 m/s and taking slightly\nlonger than 2 days. For 1 year of formation maintenance, taking only differential\n\ndrag into account, approximately 1.2 m/s of DV is required and a maneuver needs to\nbe executed once every 9 days.\n\nThe orbital geometry of this mission phase lends itself extremely well to perform\n\nsynoptic and synergetic observations with the spectropolarimeters on both space-\n\ncraft. The orbital geometry combined with the nine Earth-looking Fields-Of-Views\n\n(FOVs) of the spectropolarimeter results in many simultaneous intersections of the\n\nspectropolarimeter FOVs and in several overlapping spectropolarimeter FOVs at\n\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. This allows retrieval of aerosol characteristics at specific\n\naltitudes at a single moment in time and it allows making more observations of\n\ngeolocations from various angles during a single pass (especially near the equator),\n\nwhich is highly desired for aerosol characterization. The ?5.7 km accuracy in the\ninter-satellite range is driven by the ground pixel size of the spectropolarimeter at\n\n650 km altitude, which is approximately 11.4 km.\n\n22.3 The System Design\n\nIn this section, the design of the FAST system is presented. The system architecture\n\nis briefly discussed, followed by information about the science payloads\n\n(a spectropolarimeter, an altimeter and a microwave radiometer). The system/\n\nsubsystem design of FAST-D is specified along with an introduction of FAST-T.\n\nThe architecture of the ground segment is also described with a focus on scientific\n\ndata processing and distribution.\n\nFig. 22.2 The science\n\nobservation phase\n\n642 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\n22.3.1 System Architecture\n\nThe architecture of the FAST system is schematically shown in Fig. 22.3 [4]. Like\n\nmany other space systems, the FAST system consists of both space and ground\n\nsegment. However, due to the feature of formation flying, the space segment is\n\ncomprised of two spacecraft, i.e. FAST-D and FAST-T. During the procedure of\n\nformation flying, i.e. the scientific mode as well as the technology demonstration\n\nmode, the two spacecraft will communicate with each other either through a direct\n\nInter-Satellite Link (ISL) or through ground stations. The distributed computing\n\nand other technologies will be implemented via the ISL. Details about the elements\n\nof this architecture, the ISL and other issues will be discussed in the remaining part\n\nof this chapter.\n\n22.3.2 Payloads\n\nIn total three scientific payloads will be flown on the FAST mission: a Dutch\n\nspectropolarimeter (on both FAST-D and FAST-T spacecraft), the Dutch Stereo\n\nImaging Laser AlTimeter (SILAT, on FAST-D), and the Chinese Dual-Frequency\n\nMicrowave RadioMeter (DFMRM, on FAST-T).\n\nFig. 22.3 The FAST system architecture\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 643\n\n\n\n22.3.2.1 Spectropolarimeter\n\nThe candidate for the spectropolarimeter payload is the Spectropolarimeter for\n\nPlanetary Exploration (SPEX), cf. Fig. 22.4, which is under development by a\n\nDutch consortium consisting of companies and knowledge institutes. Since SPEX\n\nis ultimately intended for Mars missions, a special version, i.e. SPEX-FAST, is\n\nspecifically being designed for the FAST mission. An important modification of\n\nSPEX-FAST compared to SPEX-Mars is the change from seven planet-looking\n\nFOVs and two limb-looking FOVs to nine planet-looking FOVs. Reason for this\n\nchange is that SPEX-FAST will focus on characterizing aerosols, leading to a\n\npreference for planet-looking FOVs over limb-looking FOVs. Due to SPEX\u2019\n\ncapability of accurate full linear spectropolarimetry without moving parts or liquid\n\ncrystals, this spectropolarimeter is an ideal instrument for measuring and\n\ncharacterizing aerosols from space. The current opto-mechanical design of SPEX\n\n(without detector and electronics) has a mass of 0.9 kg and dimensions of 15 ? 12\n? 6 cm3. The complete instrument is expected to have a volume of ~1 litre, a mass\nof 2 kg, and 2 W maximum power consumption [5].\n\n22.3.2.2 SILAT\n\nSILAT, cf. Fig. 22.5, is a highly integrated payload suite that is composed of three\n\nseparate instruments contained in a thermally stable SiC frame; an innovative single\n\nphoton counting Laser AlTimeter (LAT), a High Resolution Camera (HRC) and a\n\nStereoscopic Camera (SCAM) [6]. It is under development by a consortium led by\n\ncosine Research. A structural re-design of the instrument has been made for the\n\nFAST mission, which results in considerable mass savings as compared to the\n\nearlier design for a mission to Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa. SILAT contains no moving\n\nparts, and all cooling devices are passive; only cold fingers and radiators are used.\n\nThis increases the reliability of the payload suite, which is essential for space\n\nFig. 22.4 SPEX opto-\n\nmechanical design [5]\n\n644 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\nmissions. The optical filters used on the cameras have been optimized for the\n\nspectral response from water.\n\nA breadboard prototype of the LAT has been completed by cosine Research and\n\nhas been successfully tested both indoor and outdoor in early 2010, demonstrating a\n\ndistance measurement resolution better than 15 cm [7]. An engineering model of\n\nSILAT, consisting of a mixture of space qualified and commercial-off-the-shelf\n\n(COTS) parts, is foreseen to undergo flight testing on a TU Delft laboratory aircraft.\n\nSILAT has a mass of 5.2 kg and measures 28 ? 28 ? 30 cm3. The maximum\npower consumption of SILAT is ~14 W with the LAT requiring ~12 W.\n\n22.3.2.3 DFMRM\n\nDFMRM is an instrument that measures global luminosity/temperature data at\n\nK-band (23.8 GHz) and Ku-band (37 GHz). Currently, DFMRM is under\n\ndevelopment by the General Establishment of Space Science and Application,\n\nChinese Academy of Sciences (GESSA/CAS). The designed DFMRM is box-\n\nshaped with dimensions of 33 ? 27 ? 20 cm3, has a mass of no more than\n15 kg and an average power consumption of less than 20 W (peak power\n\n<25 W). There are two observation channels on DFMRM: the primary one is\nnadir-oriented, and the secondary one points to cold space (off sunlight) for\n\ncalibration purposes [4].\n\n22.3.3 Spacecraft\n\nThe space segment of the FAST system consists of two satellites: FAST-D and\n\nFAST-T.\n\nFig. 22.5 SILAT [6]\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 645\n\n\n\n22.3.3.1 FAST-D\n\nFAST-D is a 50 kg micro-satellite considered for development by Dutch academia\n\nand industries [8]. As shown in Fig. 22.6, FAST-D has a 0.5 ? 0.5 ? 0.7 m box-\nshaped structure with three body mounted solar panels on the zenith surface and the\n\ntwo along-track surfaces, respectively. The internal structure consists of multiple\n\ntrays, which are used both for easy integration and for load carrying. On the nadir\n\nsurface, the payload detector heads and a high-gain S-band data-downloading\n\nantenna are accommodated, as well as low-gain Telemetry and Tele-Command\n\n(TTC) antennas. The optical heads of the star tracker are installed on the surface\n\nthat is parallel to the orbit plane.\n\nFAST-D will be a synthesis and showcase of Dutch achievements on space-\n\nrelated Micro-Systems Technology (MST). Most of the components onboard are\n\ndeveloped/under development by Dutch universities or industries, and some of\n\nthem have been demonstrated in space. For instance, the wireless sun sensor\n\ndeveloped by TNO has been flown on the Delfi-C3 nano-satellite [9]. From this\n\naspect, FAST-D will not only be a platform for MST demonstration, but also to\n\nsome extent a System-of-MicroSystems (SoMS).\n\nThe overall design of the FAST-D is schematized in Fig. 22.7 [10]. The\n\nsubsystem design is briefly introduced as bellows.\n\nDue to the requirements from the payloads, FAST-D\u2019s Attitude Determination\n\nand Control Subsystem (ADCS) shall be able to provide attitude information with at\n\nFig. 22.6 FAST-D\n\nspacecraft\n\n646 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\nleast 30 arcseconds accuracy around the various body axes using fine attitude\n\nsensors, and shall allow the control of attitude with a minimum pointing accuracy\n\nof 300 arcseconds.\n\nThe attitude determination is achieved with the use of two redundant 3-axis\n\nmagnetometers (MM) and two micro sun sensors (SS) for coarse information. For\n\nprecise determination two miniaturized CMOS star trackers (ST) and two Micro\n\nInertial Measurement Units (MIMU) are used.\n\nThe attitude control is performed with reaction wheels (RW) and uses\n\nmagnetoquers (MTR) for momentum dumping and coarse control. The four micro\n\nreaction wheels are mounted in a pyramid configuration maximizing control effec-\n\ntiveness, and the three magnetoquer rods are mounted in an XYZ configuration.\n\nA double-loop Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) technique will be adopted,\n\nwhich allows flexible control of a nonlinear system in different flying modes [8].\n\nThe double-loop NDI technique avoids strong nonlinear feedback which causes\n\nunnecessary actuator saturations, and provides flexibility for multiple operational\n\nmodes by separating rate and angular control.\n\nTwo redundant Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers will func-\n\ntion as absolute navigation sensors for onboard orbit determination. The onboard\n\norbit determination is further enhanced through uploading precise GNSS ephemer-\n\nides from ground. The relative position and attitude information will be obtained by\n\nexchanging navigation and attitude data via inter-satellite communication.\n\nFAST-D uses three body mounted solar panels as the primary power supply, and\n\ntwo Li-ion battery packages as the secondary power supply. Each solar panel is\n\npopulated with triple-junction GaAs cells which have a minimum average effi-\n\nciency of 26.8% at Begin-Of-Life (BOL). In total the power subsystem is able to\n\nprovide at least an orbit average power of 45 W at BOL, 50% more than required.\n\nFig. 22.7 Schematic of the FAST-D spacecraft\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 647\n\n\n\nThe Command and Data Handling Subsystem (CDHS) consists of OnBoard\n\nComputers (OBC), data storage, data buses, and the relevant software. There are\n\ntwo OBCs on FAST-D, one for housekeeping and data processing, and the other\n\nfor AOCS and formation flying. They are also hot redundant for each other in case\n\nof failure. The payload data are stored in a radiation tolerant solid state memory\n\nwith a capacity of 8 GB. The data buses are composed of a high speed bus for\n\npayload data transfer and a low speed bus for command/control. The onboard\n\nsoftware performs three primary functions: system boot, housekeeping, and\n\nAOCS/FF processing.\n\nThe communication subsystem, also called Radio Frequency (RF) subsystem,\n\noperates at S-band due to the payload data download requirement. The subsystem\n\nconsists of two parts. One part is the Satellite-Ground Communication\n\nModule, which is composed of two hot redundant command receivers, one low\n\npower transmitter, one high power transmitter, and associated antennas. The\n\nlow power transmitter is primarily used for telemetry, and the high power one\n\nis primarily for payload data downlink. However, for redundancy on the transmit\n\nchain, these two transmitters both can be used as the backup of the other one. The\n\ntwo command receivers share two patch antennas, which are mounted on the nadir\n\nand the zenith surfaces of the satellite, respectively. The low power transmitter\n\nfeeds another two patch antennas. The high power transmitter is connected with a\n\nhelical antenna.\n\nAnother part is the Inter-Satellite Communication Module, which is composed\n\nof a transceiver and two patch antennas. During FF, the satellites will exchange\n\ninformation, such as position and attitude, between each other through this link. As\n\npayload data are not intended to be exchanged, only a low power transceiver\n\n(ISL TXRX) and low-gain antennas are utilized.\n\nDue to the requirements of a piggy-back launch, FAST-D should avoid the\n\nutilization of hazardous components, such as high energy propellant, high pressure\n\nvessels, etc. Meanwhile, the relatively large DV requirements and the volume\nlimitation on the spacecraft also prevent FAST-D from utilizing conventional\n\nchemical propulsion techniques. Alternatively, a cold gas generator is used on\n\nFAST-D to replace the cold gas tank.\n\nThe propulsion subsystem of FAST-D is composed of a cold gas generator,\n\nan electronics board, an orbit control thruster, and the associated valves\n\nand tubes. It provides for initial launcher injection corrections and formation\n\nmaintenance. The cold gas generator, developed by TNO and Bradford Engi-\n\nneering, consists of a solid block of chemical material inside a casing [11]. Once\n\nignited, this solid material will decompose into the required gas that leaves the\n\ngas generator at ambient temperature. The major advantage of the cold gas\n\ngenerator over the gas tank is that it stores the propellant in solid state. Hence,\n\nno large volume, high-pressured tank and associated valves are needed; no risks\n\nfor leakage; and the mass and volume of the complete propulsion subsystem are\n\nboth optimized.\n\nCurrently nitrogen and oxygen generators are available. For FAST-D the nitro-\n\ngen generator has been selected, because of its relatively high gas output efficiency\n\n648 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\n(each kg of solid propellant can output 260 liters of gas with the pressure range of\n\n0.1\u201315 MPa) and its availability for space applications through its space qualifica-\n\ntion on ESA\u2019s PROBA\u20132 satellite.\n\nThe structure of FAST-D is to be manufactured from conventional aluminum\n\nalloy including the use of honeycomb panels. The primary structure consists of a\n\nlauncher separation system, separation panel, avionics stack, payload panel, top\n\npanel, three solar panels and one nadir panel.\n\nThe overall spacecraft is designed to ensure a balanced thermal environment\n\nin all operating, eclipse and safe modes. Due to the utilization of the cold\n\ngas generator, the local heating for the propellant tank is not necessary\n\nanymore. Therefore, thermal control is achieved primarily by simple passive\n\napproaches.\n\n22.3.3.2 FAST-T\n\nFAST-T is a small satellite considered for development at Tsinghua University [4].\n\nAs shown in Fig. 22.8, FAST-T is a 0.75? 0.75? 0.73 m cube with two deploy-fix\nsolar panels, and the total mass is less than 130 kg.\n\nThe primary attitude mode of FAST-T is 3-axis stabilized nadir pointing with a\n\ncontrol accuracy of better than 0.1? (3s) and stability of better than 0.01?/s (3s). In\ncase of any critical fault, the satellite will automatically enter into a safe mode in\n\nwhich the negative Y axis will point to the Sun with an accuracy of better than\n\n5? and a stability better than 0.05?/s (3s).\n\nFig. 22.8 FAST-T spacecraft\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 649\n\n\n\n22.3.4 Ground Segment\n\nAccording to the architecture in Fig. 22.3, the ground segment of FAST consists of\n\ntwo ground stations, one Mission Control Center (MCC), and one Science Data\n\nCenter (SDC).\n\nIn order to increase the window for satellite-ground access, two geographically\n\ndistributed ground stations are planned: one in Delft, and one in Beijing. Both\n\nground stations are equipped with 3 m paraboloid antennas and have identical\n\nfunctions: sending commands, receiving telemetry and payload data, and acting\n\nas backup route for ISL.\n\nAll ground operation decisions are made in a single MCC and then sent to the\n\nground station for generating control commands, and all data received by ground\n\nstations are also initially analyzed in the MCC. The telemetry data will be further\n\nprocessed here, and the payload data will be sent to the SDC.\n\n22.4 Scientific Applications\n\nThe FAST mission will carry several innovative small science payloads that enable\n\nresearch in several areas. These are the characterization of atmospheric aerosols,\n\nthe seasonal variation of height profiles in the cryosphere, and the correlation\n\nbetween the two.\n\n22.4.1 Aerosol Characterization\n\nAerosols are suspensions of fine solid or liquid droplets in a gas. The size of these\n\nparticles can range from about 0.001 to 100 mm. While liquid aerosols will be\nspherical, solid aerosols will have irregular shapes which depend on their composi-\n\ntion and their formation process. Primary types of terrestrial aerosols are oceanic\n\nsea salt, desert dust, volcanic ashes and volcanic sulfuric acid and various types of\n\nanthropogenic aerosols (e.g. black carbon). Most aerosol particles reside in the\n\nlower layers of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, extending up to around 1 km. Aerosol\n\nparticles can have significant effects on air quality, weather, and the climate.\n\nAerosols affect the climate through scattering and absorption of solar radiation,\n\nscattering, absorption and emission of thermal radiation, acting as cloud condensa-\n\ntion nuclei, and catalyzing chemical reactions [12].\n\nCharacterization of atmospheric aerosols is important since current uncertainties\n\nin the aerosol forcing and the total solar irradiance are so large that they preclude\n\nmeaningful climate model evaluation [13]. Since the degree and direction of\n\npolarization of scattered light is very sensitive to the shape and composition\n\nof the scattering particle, spectropolarimetry lends itself extremely well to aerosol\n\n650 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\ncharacterization. However, this has never been done from space. The first mission\n\nthat intended to do this was NASA\u2019s Glory mission, which failed to reach orbit after\n\nliftoff aboard a Taurus XL rocket on 4 March 2011 [14].\n\nAdditional significant scientific outputs on aerosol characterization are expected\n\nthrough the configuration of FF. As mentioned in Section 22.2, in the technology\n\ndemonstration phase, the close FF will allow cross-calibration between payloads on\n\nthe different spacecraft since they are essentially measuring the same properties at\n\nalmost the same moment in time. Then in the science observation phase, the\n\ndistance between the two FF spacecraft will be 1,225 ? 5.7 km. This orbital\ngeometry lends itself extremely well to perform synoptic and synergetic\n\nobservations especially with the spectropolarimeters on both spacecraft. The orbital\n\ngeometry combined with the nine Earth looking FOV of the spectropolarimeter\n\nresults in many simultaneous intersections of spectropolarimeter FOVs and in\n\nseveral overlapping spectropolarimeter FOVs at the Earth\u2019s surface, cf. Fig. 22.2.\n\nThis allows retrieval of aerosol characteristics at specific altitudes at a single\n\nmoment in time and it allows making more observations of geolocations from\n\nvarious angles during a single pass (especially near the equator), which is highly\n\ndesired for aerosol characterization.\n\n22.4.2 Cryosphere and Precipitation\n\nA recent study by Shindell and Faluvegi [15] states that \u201c[. . .] aerosols have had a\nlarge role in both global and regional climate change during the entire twentieth\n\ncentury [. . .] Arctic climate is especially sensitive to Northern Hemisphere short-\nlived pollutants. [. . .] Our calculations suggest that black carbon and tropospheric\nozone have contributed [. . .] to Arctic warming since 1890, making them attractive\ntargets for Arctic warming mitigation. In addition, they respond quickly to\n\nemissions controls, and reductions have ancillary benefits including improved\n\nhuman and ecosystem health.\u201d Thus, recent atmospheric models suggest a strong\n\nlink between aerosols (pollutants) and Arctic climate. Validation of these results\n\ncan lead to more stringent emissions restrictions worldwide.\n\nThis can, to some extent, be done in the FAST mission due to its unique payload\n\nsuite. Although the 15 cm height resolution of the LAT is not spectacular, it is\n\nsufficient to, in combination with the HRC and SCAM, clearly distinguish between\n\nice/snow and rocks and to monitor seasonal variations in height profiles in the\n\ncryosphere. When correlated with the spectropolarimeter data, this information can\n\nbe used to investigate whether there is evidence for positive correlations between\n\ncertain types of aerosols and (local) reductions/increases in ice/snow cover [3, 16].\n\nThe measurements made by the DFMRM instrument will enable acquisition of\n\nthe physical parameters related to water present in both liquid and vapor form in\n\nclouds. These parameters can be used to construct more accurate precipitation\n\nprediction models and will aid the in-depth analysis of the effect of aerosols,\n\ncharacterized by the spectropolarimeter, on precipitation.\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 651\n\n\n\n22.5 Technological Challenges\n\nThe FAST mission will demonstrate FF technology using micro satellites; and will\n\nalso generate increased science data return through FF. From this point, FF is the\n\ncore of the whole mission, and many technical challenges are related to it, espe-\n\ncially in the case of using micro satellites. In this section, four key technical\n\nquestions are to be discussed: (1) How to build up a capable and reliable micro-\n\nsatellite platform based on MST? (2) How do the two satellites exchange informa-\n\ntion? (3) How do they process the received information? And (4) how do they\n\nutilize the processed information?\n\n22.5.1 Systems Engineering of FAST-D\n\nThe technical objective of developing FAST-D is to build up a capable and reliable\n\nmicro-satellite platform based on MST, which will be the first step towards a more\n\ncompact and flexible SoMS nano-satellite for future multi-mission applications.\n\nTherefore, the following system engineering philosophy is adopted for FAST-D [10]:\n\n\u2022 Extensively utilize MST components as constituents of the platform;\n\n\u2022 Apply redundancy where needed for higher reliability; and\n\n\u2022 Allow a certain level of technical risks for low cost and short development time.\n\n22.5.1.1 Strategy of Utilizing MST Components\n\nUnlike some missions where MST components are onboard as payloads for test or\n\ndemonstration, FAST-D extensively utilizes MST components as constituents of\n\nthe platform. However, there is an important issue that needs to be considered\n\nbefore utilization, i.e. the maturity of the MST components.\n\nThe maturity of MST for space use is still doubted by many developers of\n\nconventional or even small spacecraft. This is due to the fact that many MST\n\ncomponents are originally developed for terrestrial applications and, therefore,\n\nusually cannot fully meet the special requirements (on performance or working\n\nenvironment) from space industries. Moreover, space MST components are still in\n\nthe infant stage and more developments and demonstrations need to be done in the\n\nnear future.\n\nThe immaturity of space MST also applies to the MST components onboard\n\nFAST-D. Currently some of the components are still in the stage of development\n\nwith relatively low Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). Considering the current\n\nand short-term TRL of MST components, the FAST-D spacecraft is not designed as\n\na highly compact SoMS satellite, but as a mixture of MST and conventional\n\ntechnologies. For example, one of the two star trackers onboard FAST-D is the\n\n652 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\nnewly developed Facet Nano [17], and the other one is the Advanced Stellar\n\nCompass (ASC) that has been adopted by a number of missions.\n\nThere are several arguments against this mixture strategy. The first argument is\n\nabout the complexity. Since different types of components are utilized, the work-\n\nload for interface control is significantly increased. The second argument is the\n\nreliability due to relatively low TRL components. However, previous experiences\n\nand lessons indicate that micro- and nano-satellite missions should allow a certain\n\nlevel of technical risks for lower cost and shorter development time. Therefore,\n\nafter a careful trade-off on cost, schedule, complexity, reliability and other factors\n\nand, most importantly, keeping in mind the technical objective of the mission, this\n\nmixture strategy is eventually chosen for FAST-D.\n\n22.5.1.2 Strategy for Achieving High Reliability\n\nAlthough a certain level of risks is allowed, realizing as high as possible reliability\n\nis still one of the most important technical goals of FAST-D. To achieve this goal, a\n\nSingle-Point-of-Failure Free (SPOFF) design is performed for critical systems.\n\nHere critical systems are defined as the systems that work in the \u201cSafe Mode\u201d\n\nand consist of the CDHS, TTC, Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS), and coarse\n\nattitude sensors/actuators.\n\nThe SPOFF design of critical systems is based on a combined redundancy\n\nstrategy. Due to mass and power limitations, \u201cfunctional redundancy\u201d is adopted\n\nas the primary approach for redundancy of critical systems. Here \u201cfunctional\n\nredundancy\u201d indicates that the function of a component can be performed (some-\n\ntimes with decreased efficiency) by another component in case of failure and thus\n\nduplication of the hardware is not necessary. One example of \u201cfunctional redun-\n\ndancy\u201d is the CDHS, where two processors are adopted, one for housekeeping and\n\npayload data handling and the other one for attitude determination and control (see\n\nFig. 22.7). If any of these two processors crashes, the other one will take over its\n\nresponsibilities. Another example is the TTC, where the low-power transmitter will\n\nprovide the function of payload data downlink in case the dedicated data transmitter\n\nfails although the efficiency of the downlink will decrease due to the relatively\n\nlower data rate; the data transmitter is also able to send housekeeping data. The\n\n\u201cfunctional redundancy\u201d is also implemented by re-configuring other components.\n\nFor instance, underactuated control algorithms are provided with the AOCS. Even\n\nif two reaction wheels do not work well, the remaining two reaction wheels can still\n\nprovide the capability of 3-axis stabilization through underactuated attitude con-\n\ntrol. In addition, \u201cHardware redundancy\u201d is adopted by FAST-D as the secondary\n\napproach for redundancy. The EPS is a good example of \u201chardware redundancy\u201d.\n\nSince two sets of Battery Charge Regulator (BCR), Power Conditioning Module\n\n(PCM) and Power Distribution Module (PDM) are provided, full redundancy is\n\nachieved. Two warm-redundant TTC receivers also ensure SPOFF of the uplink.\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 653\n\n\n\nIn summary, the reliability of FAST-D is achieved by synergistically adopting\n\n\u201cfunctional redundancy\u201d and \u201chardware redundancy\u201d instead of solely utilizing\n\nexpensive space-grade components.\n\n22.5.2 Inter-Satellite Information Exchange\n\nThe most important issue for a successful FF mission is acquiring state information\n\nfrom other satellites in the formation. Usually, this could be done through direct ISL\n\n(RF or optical based). For the FAST mission, however, a mixed strategy for inter-\n\nsatellite information exchange is proposed.\n\nIn the technology demonstration mode, the distance between the two satellites is\n\nonly 1 km, and each satellite is in the other one\u2019s line of sight. Therefore, a direct ISL\n\nis utilized as the nominal communication route. To avoid technical complexity, an\n\nRF based ISL is chosen, which can achieve a relatively high data rate due to the low\n\nfree space loss. Therefore it will be beneficial not only to exchange state informa-\n\ntion, but also to the distributed processing of data. This direct ISL in principle also\n\nallows for relative ranging between the satellites using the same signal.\n\nIn the science mode, the along-track separation between the satellites will be\n\naround 1,225 km, which implies that the two satellites are still in each other\u2019s line of\n\nsight and the direct RF ISL is still available. However, a lower data rate is expected\n\nas the free space loss is much higher.\n\nExcept the direct link, a ground-in-the-loop communication route is used as backup\n\n[4]. For this type of communication, there are two options as shown in Fig. 22.9: (1)\n\nOne satellite transmits data to one ground station, then this ground station transmits the\n\ndata to the second satellite when it flies over; (2) One satellite transmits data to one\n\nground station, then through internet the data are transferred to the other ground\n\nstation, which is responsible for transmitting the data to the second satellite. In the\n\nFASTmission, these two options are mixed adopted subject to the shortest delay time.\n\n22.5.3 Onboard Information Processing\n\nUtilizing onboard information processing has a number of advantages for small\n\nsatellites. The most important one is to provide near real-time results while\n\navoiding the costs and limitations involved with sending the data down to Earth\n\nto be processed.\n\nIn order to avoid the primary disadvantage associated with onboard processing,\n\ni.e. the errors inherent in the onboard processing cannot be undone for previously\n\ncomputed results, the FAST mission adopts a conservative strategy: The scientific\n\ndata will be processed onboard and, meanwhile, also stored in the large volume\n\nsolid state memory. A substantial part of the onboard-processed data will then be\n\nvalidated with the original data in the ground station.\n\n654 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\nConsidering about the technology readiness, the data processing will be primar-\n\nily implemented in each satellite\u2019s own OBC. The items for onboard processing\n\ninclude data compression and image processing. For example, the volume of data to\n\nbe collected by SILAT could be dramatically reduced (i.e. to <1% of the original\namount), if the images captured by HRC and SCAM can be identified and the\n\nuseless images can be deleted onboard.\n\nBesides the conventional \u201clocal\u201d computing, also space-based distributed com-\n\nputing will be demonstrated by the FAST mission to explore the possibility of fully\n\nutilizing the computing powers of FF small satellites for onboard processing. The\n\nconcept of space-based distributed computing will utilize the processors on each\n\nsatellite as a true distributed computer. For the FAST mission this indicates a space-\n\nbased computer with (at least) two spatially distributed processors.\n\nThe types of problems under consideration for such a distributed computing\n\nnetwork are typically large, dense linear algebra problems. This is because these\n\noperations can be processed using blocked algorithms, which are well suited for\n\ndistributed and, possibly, heterogeneous systems. An important experiment will be\n\nthe real-time orbit determination of the FAST formation, because the size of this\n\nFig. 22.9 Ground-in-the-Loop communication routes\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 655\n\n\n\nproblem could be very large (i.e. thousands of parameters using thousands of\n\nobservations) and beyond the capability of a single processor.\n\n22.5.4 Distributed Utilization of Information\n\nThrough inter-satellite communication and onboard \u201clocal\u201d or distributed\n\nprocessing, parts of the data received by the two satellites are shared, and each\n\nsatellite has acquired the other\u2019s state such as precise position and attitude. This\n\ninformation will be used to implement different tasks related to FF. Within the\n\nFAST mission, two of these tasks are given priority: the propellant optimized\n\ndistributed propulsion, and the cooperative control.\n\n22.5.4.1 Propellant Optimized Distributed Propulsion\n\nWithout formation maintenance, the two satellites in the FAST formation will\n\nquickly drift apart due to differential air drag and differential semi-major axis.\n\nSince it is vital that the two satellites remain at a specified distance (for the\n\ntechnology demonstration mode this is 1 ? 0.1 km, and for the science mode this\nis 1,225 ? 7.5 km) with respect to each other, the inter-satellite distance needs to be\nperiodically adjusted using the propulsion subsystem. As each of the two satellites\n\nin the formation is equipped with a propulsion system, there is the possibility to\n\nimplement propellant optimized distributed propulsion. This means that by virtue\n\nof the direct ISL, the two satellites can autonomously decide when and which\n\nsatellite should fire its thruster(s), thereby minimizing and optionally also balancing\n\nthe propellant consumption of the two satellites. The two propulsion systems also\n\nprovide redundancy: even if one does not function, the other one still can perform\n\nformation maintenance maneuvers.\n\n22.5.4.2 Cooperative Control\n\nAs mentioned early in last sub-subsection, FAST will perform propellant optimized\n\ndistributed propulsion, which requires the cooperation of the propulsion subsystems\n\non both satellites because the firing decisions are not intended to be made only\n\nbased on one satellite\u2019s state. Furthermore, the two satellites will observe\n\noverlapped areas on the Earth, which indicates that the AOCS of the two satellites\n\nneed to work cooperatively to perform relative attitude maintenance and reference\n\nattitude tracking. The common feature of these problems is: Not only the position\n\nand the attitude, but also the behavior of each satellite shall be coordinated and\n\ncontrolled. To solve these problems, cooperative control technology will be\n\ninvestigated and demonstrated by the FAST mission.\n\n656 J. Guo et al.\n\n\n\nCooperative control is a technology that allows a team (with at least two\n\nmembers) to cooperatively decide where to go, how to behave, and so on. It is\n\nnot a fairly new term as it has already been studied in the context of a cluster of\n\nmobile robots or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or even for deep space\n\nmissions [18]. However this technology has not been demonstrated or tested on\n\norbit so far. In general, there are three approaches for cooperative control:\n\ncentralized, decentralized, or distributed. Considering about technology readiness,\n\nmission need (only two satellites in the formation) and many other factors, the first\n\ntwo approaches are expected to be further studied and, eventually, demonstrated\n\nthrough the FAST mission.\n\n22.5.4.3 Multi-Agent Based Framework\n\nTo implement the proposed activities, including propellant optimized distributed\n\npropulsion and cooperative control, an agent-based framework (see Fig. 22.10) is\n\npreliminarily designed under the FAST system architecture (c.f. Fig. 22.3). The\n\nreasons for choosing a Multi-Agent System (MAS) are not only from the research\n\naspect, but also due to the following facts:\n\n\u2022 Autonomy \u2013 both satellites are required to behave at least partially autonomous;\n\n\u2022 Local views \u2013 neither satellite has a full global view of the system, although both\n\nof them have some knowledge of each other;\n\n\u2022 Decentralization \u2013 due to the limited ground station coverage, there is no one\n\ncentralized controller for the system during most of the flight time;\n\n\u2022 Flexibility \u2013 although so far the FAST mission only has two satellites, it actually\n\nhas an open-system architecture, i.e. more satellites can join the formation later.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 22.10, the framework has agents at two levels: spacecraft level\n\n(e.g. FAST-D Agent) and function level (e.g. FF Agent). Spacecraft-level agents\n\nare in charge of sending/receiving information, local activity planning, command\n\nimplementation, coordination of local agents, etc. Each function-level agent has\n\nseveral skills. For example, the FF Agent is able to plan the motion of the satellite,\n\nestimate current formation parameters, and produce formation control commands.\n\nFunction-level agents can communicate with other local function-level agents and\n\ndetermine local behaviors.\n\n22.6 Educational Opportunities\n\nExcept for scientific application and technology demonstration, the FAST mission\n\nalso brings various opportunities for education. For example, the technologies to be\n\ndeveloped for or used on FAST have been introduced in various courses in TU\n\nDelft. During these courses, students are also asked to implement individual and\n\ngroup assignments that have strong links with the FAST mission. The needs of the\n\n22 Formation for Atmospheric Science and Technology Demonstration 657\n\n\n\nFAST mission motivated several M.Sc or Ph.D thesis topics that students are\n\nworking on. In addition, through the FAST mission, students from both Delft and\n\nTsinghua have the opportunity to do internship and thesis work in the other country\n\nwith different cultures. This exposure can help students to significantly broaden\n\ntheir international view and to boost their skills.\n\n22.7 Conclusions\n\nThe concept and detailed design aspects of the Dutch-Chinese FAST small\n\nsatellites FF mission have been presented.

Scientific applications of the FAST mission are discussed, with a special\n\ninterest on improved scientific return due to FF configuration. Key technical\n\nchallenges, such as systems engineering, ISL, distributed computing and coopera-\n\ntive control, are addressed.\n\nThe FAST mission has the potential to validate innovative technologies, such as\n\nMST-based sensors and actuators, and to demonstrate autonomous formation flying\n\nusing low cost spacecraft with various communication architectures and distributed\n\npropulsion systems. The FAST mission is also expected to provide important\n\nscientific outputs on aerosol characterization and the monitoring of height profiles\n\nin the cryosphere. The formation flying will improve scientific return for aerosol\n\ncharacterization by observing the same geolocation from various angles during a\n\nsingle pass. In addition, the FAST mission provides educational opportunities to\n\nuniversities to teach cutting-edge technologies and broaden the international view\n\nof students. Therefore, the FAST is a unique FF mission with impact on technology,\n\nscience and education.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This chapter is devoted to a critical analysis of the achieved improvements\n\nand of the areas of major key issues in order to analyze potential and risks of\n\ndistributed space systems. A discussion of future activities needed to prepare more\n\nadvanced distributed space missions is also provided. In particular, payloads and\n\napplications are first discussed.

Many studies have been conducted in the last years on\n\nsystems relying on two (bistatic) or multiple (multistatic) radars, which have led to\n\na great level of maturity especially in the case of bistatic SAR.\n\nM.

In both fields, bistatic SAR enables applications\n\nwhich are either impossible or strongly limited with standard monostatic\n\napproaches. A prominent example is the generation of digital elevation models by\n\nSAR interferometry, which is possible with both monostatic and bistatic\n\napproaches. It has first been theoretically demonstrated and then practically experi-\n\nenced in space by ESA ERS-1 and -2 tandem operations and by the Shuttle Radar\n\nTopography Mission. Recently, this technology was used extensively in the opera-\n\ntional TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X mission where bistatic SAR interferometry\n\nachieves unprecedented height accuracy thanks to the possibilities to avoid time\n\ndecorrelation and to reconstruct the baseline with an extremely high accuracy. In\n\ndifferent geometrical configurations, a bistatic SAR can also perform along-track\n\ninterferometry to derive velocity estimates of targets on ground. In this field and\n\ndepending on radar frequency and on the desired velocity range to be detected, a\n\nsolution with a single but partitioned antenna (e.g. TanDEM-X) can be more\n\nreliable with respect to two free flying spacecraft. Different applications have\n\nalso been studied and assessed for large baseline bistatic SAR, mainly in the\n\nambit of the SABRINA mission study: derivation of digital elevation models by\n\nmethodologies derived from radargrammetry, estimation of velocities by Doppler\n\nanalysis, estimation of terrain properties (roughness, dielectric constant, moisture),\n\nand terrain slope mapping. At the moment, no space mission implementing a large\n\nbaseline bistatic SAR is scheduled, although such applications could be explored in\n\nan extended TanDEM-X mission phase.\n\nThe multistatic SAR concept has raised an increasing interest in the last decade.\n\nMultistatic applications exploiting phase information can be conceived as a gener-\n\nalization of bistatic ones: SAR tomography is the major example. It allows\n\n3D-imaging of semi-transparent volume scatterers and permits to estimate vertical\n\nstructures of the imaged scenes (e.g. forests). SAR tomography is also greatly\n\nuseful for non-transparent scatterers to remove or reduce the layover, one of the\n\nclassical limitations in radar imagery. Multistatic SAR tomography has the same\n\nadvantages of bistatic SAR interferometry with respect to a monostatic approach.\n\nMultistatic SARs can also be utilized in more advanced modes. An example is the\n\ncapability of multistatic SAR to overcome the minimum antenna area constrain,\n\none of the major limitations in SAR design. In such cases, multiple free-flying\n\nSARs with small antennas contribute to generate a virtual SAR achieving contem-\n\nporaneously a wide swath and very small geometrical resolutions, contrary to\n\nmonostatic SARs which trade swath width versus resolutions. An additional\n\nadvanced possibility is to create very large sparse apertures. Although very\n\npromising for future development, multistatic SAR is at a lower technology readi-\n\nness level as compared to the simpler bistatic concept and its implementation seems\n\nquestionable in the near future.\n\nThe distributed payload concept has also been studied for optical payloads in both\n\nthe fields of filled or sparse sensor apertures. A filled sensor aperture concept is the one\n\n662 M. D\u2019Errico et al.\n\n\n\ncurrently flying on standard monolithic satellites. Its replacement with a distributed\n\nsensor has been studied under different approaches. The utilization of still large but\n\nlightweight surfaces to implement the primary mirror (thin-filmmembranes) has been\n\nproposed, with the other needed optical modules either connected with tethers or\n\nflying in formation. An alternative possibility to replace a large monolithic aperture\n\nhas also been analyzed: a number of smaller sensors correctly sample the large\n\naperture and maintain a correct geometry based on formation flying. Sparse aperture\n\nconcept has been studied at a lesser extent. It is worth noting that such studies were\n\nmainly conducted at a conceptual level only. Thus, distributed optical sensors appears\n\nmuch less mature than their microwave counterparts.\n\nAnother field which benefits significantly from a distributed space architecture is\n\ngravimetry. The GRACE mission has demonstrated the great capability to monitor\n\ntemporal variations of the Earth gravity field thanks to the innovative techniques to\n\ntracking at an extremely high accuracy the inter-satellite distance. Such capability\n\nstrongly enhances the potential of gravimetry missions, opening the way to new\n\napplications with respect to classical ones. As an example, gravimetry data can be\n\nutilized for climate research thanks to the capabilities to monitor the variations of\n\nboth ice mass on polar caps and water distributions in water basins.\n\nIf a payload is distributed over several spacecraft, their relative geometry plays\n\nan essential role in defining its performance. Since the spacecraft relative geometry\n\nis determined by orbital dynamics, it could be said that absolute and relative orbital\n\ndynamics as well as formation acquisition and keeping and collision avoidance\n\nbecome an essential part of the mission design. Relative dynamics is essential in\n\nany aspects of a distributed, formation-based mission: from formation design to its\n\nestablishment in orbit, from formation control to reconfiguration, when requested,\n\nand for navigation. While in early years formation studies have benefited from\n\nprevious researches on rendezvous and docking, long-term formation flying\n\nmissions require a highly accurate handling of the relative position and velocity\n\nof the involved spacecraft.\n\nRelative motion modeling has reached a high level of maturity in the last 15 years\n\nwith a strong improvement with respect to the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations,\n\nwhich constitute a very limited model for formation flying because of the Keplerian\n\nmotion and circular orbit assumptions. In particular, relative motion modeling,\n\nalthough still open to additional improvements, seems to have reached an acceptable\n\nlevel in LEO for orbits with small eccentricities. Relative motion for highly eccen-\n\ntric orbits requires additional steps to reach an assessed and agreed operational\n\npractice. Furthermore, relative motion on higher orbits (MEO, GEO) has only\n\npartially been explored. However, these limitations are not expected to pose a risk\n\nin the near-term future as most proposedmissions/applications are expected to fly on\n\nwell understood orbits. Nonetheless, it is likely that missions making use of higher\n\naltitudes (GEO in particular) could become of great interest in future.\n\nWith reference to relative guidance, navigation and control, several control\n\napproaches have been thoroughly tackled and demonstrated, considering both\n\ncontinuous and impulsive control. As for navigation, three main technologies\n\nhave been developed or are under development. GPS-based relative navigation\n\n23 Future Trend, Potential, Risks 663\n\n\n\nhas already been successfully demonstrated on orbit since the GRACE mission. It\n\nhas in particular shown that carrier-phase differential techniques strongly improve\n\nnavigation accuracies which could be obtained with pseudorange measurements. It\n\nhas been extensively demonstrated that centimeter accuracy on relative position can\n\nbe achieved in real time, while millimeter accuracy is achievable in post-\n\nprocessing. Those accuracies are achievable provided that a good relative dynamics\n\nmodel is utilized, the mission allows smooth spacecraft operations, for example\n\nwith respect to thruster activities, and appropriate GPS receivers are used. These\n\nperformances open new perspectives with respect to autonomous control on one\n\nhand and, in addition, enable high accuracy digital elevation models generation by\n\nSAR interferometry. For instance, Tandem-X interferometric performance are in\n\nfact guaranteed, among other reasons, by this great capability of high precision\n\nbaseline reconstruction.\n\nRelative positioning can be also provided by other sensors. Relative navigation\n\nby locally generated radio frequency ranging signals (Direct Sequence Spread\n\nSpectrum signals) has been studied with a technique similar to GNSS systems.\n\nRadio frequency relative navigation techniques and hardware have been proved on\n\norbit during the PRISMA mission. Finally, relative navigation can be provided by\n\noptical metrology, as demonstrated for close separations formerly during rendez-\n\nvous and docking missions and later during the PRISMA mission. Optical metrol-\n\nogy has also potential developments for large satellite distance. In particular, if\n\ndifferent orders of magnitudes of satellite separations are expected during a\n\ndistributed mission lifetime, a multisensor approach is needed to cover different\n\ndistance ranges with adequate performance. However, it should be recognized that\n\nthe great success and wide use of GPS-based navigation are making less attractive\n\nother techniques in low Earth orbit, in particular when dealing with microwave\n\nscales and having the possibility to apply differential processing. Finally, it is worth\n\nunderlining that while a strong maturity has been reached in relative navigation, the\n\ndetermination and control of relative attitude need further investigations.\n\nDistributed systems clearly need novel approaches to system design, develop-\n\nment and operation. In particular, with an increasing number of identical (or\n\nsimilar) coordinated spacecraft replacing monolithic systems, modularity becomes\n\na crucial aspect to reduce costs. It also enables rapid insertion of new technologies\n\nin space, adaptation of a system to long period project evolution, reduction of\n\nqualification issues (multiplication of the same qualified module in lieu of develop-\n\nment of a new module). Modularity is greatly beneficial because it allows fast\n\nassembly by off-the-shelf components, which is essential when fast reconfiguration\n\ncapabilities are required. A modular approach also allows one to simplify the design\n\nprocess, breaking it into a number of simpler, concurrent processes. Finally, a\n\nmodular system exhibits a graceful degradation and it can be easier repaired or\n\nupgraded by substituting only required modules.\n\nIf on the one hand, repetitive modularity is widespread as a means to achieve\n\nhigh performance utilizing low performance devices by simply increasing their\n\nnumber, hierarchical modularity is still an area to be explored. A hierarchical\n\nsystem is in fact rather different because it works by assembling larger entities\n\n664 M. D\u2019Errico et al.\n\n\n\nfrom subordinate entities and by interconnecting them with proper busses. Thus,\n\nhierarchical modularity can be applied by conceiving the system as an assembly of\n\ndifferent sub-systems, in turn obtained as a combination of several sub-modules on\n\ndifferent hierarchical levels. Hierarchical modularity can be greatly beneficial to\n\ndistributed systems because of its embedded potential to distribute the intelligence\n\nthroughout the system. An architecture building on modular components and\n\nsubsystems, which are in turn intelligent to perform self-monitoring and control\n\nfunctions, allows a system with different levels of internal autonomy to be\n\nintegrated and makes available more resources for the on-board computer to\n\ninteract and collaborate with nearby platforms. Such effort is aided by two on-\n\ngoing developments: availability of an increasing number of miniaturized and space\n\nqualified microelectronics devices (including microcontrollers) and development of\n\na variety of data busses (including space qualified CAN bus) which are particularly\n\nsuited for modular system implementations.\n\nAutonomy is itself an important feature for any upcoming space mission to\n\nreduce mission cost. If autonomy can be still limited for two spacecraft systems\n\noperating at reasonable distances, it becomes a fundamental need for distributed\n\nsystems integrating a large number of spacecraft. Several approaches have been\n\nanalyzed for formation organization, such as leader follower, virtual structure, and\n\nbehavioral. The latter appears both better suited for multi spacecraft systems and\n\nmore flexible and inherently adaptable to an evolutionary environment. In this\n\nambit multi agent systems seem promising because they are consistent with\n\nde-centralized problems of a society of interacting, autonomous components.\n\nNonetheless, it must be considered that such technology is not mature in an orbital,\n\noperational scenario: it has only been partially tested in laboratories and needs\n\nfurther developments even at a theoretical level. When considering autonomous\n\norganization and operation of a distributed system, an additional concern must be\n\nanalyzed. The need for an adequate information flow among the platforms for both\n\nformation control and payload operation has experienced only limited analysis.\n\nNonetheless, this aspect is critical for formation implementation due to limited\n\ntelecommunication resources (data rate, power, etc.) and geometrical conditions\n\n(relative visibility).\n\nThe ground segment is also an issue to be considered seriously. The classical\n\napproach of ground segments assigns the specific tasks (S/C monitoring & control;\n\nP/L data reception & archives; P/L data products & distribution) to specific ground\n\nfacilities communicating through complicated protocols. As the number of space-\n\ncraft increases, a change in the operations paradigm is necessary to avoid a\n\nconcomitant increase in the operational cost, which is inevitable with a simple\n\ndownscaling. A qualitative change combining the different tasks and facilities in\n\nnetworks with new features is therefore needed. Key words for new ground systems\n\nare: open systems, automation, \u201cinternet\u201d technology, multi-session operations,\n\nground station networks, enhanced on-board autonomy.\n\nFrom a systems architecture perspective, distributed space systems can be\n\nimplemented not only as formations, but as constellations, trains, swarms, and\n\nfractionated satellites. Constellations provide a large coverage which is typically\n\n23 Future Trend, Potential, Risks 665\n\n\n\nof global nature combined with low control accuracy. Their implementation and\n\noperations is well understood at least for Medium Earth Orbits (MEO) such as the\n\nexisting GPS NavStar system and the upcoming Galileo system. Formations, which\n\nhave been thoroughly herein analyzed, implement a distributed space architecture\n\nwith typically a regional coverage requiring a high control accuracy. An efficient\n\nalternative to formations are trains, where payload is distributed on various\n\nsatellites which essentially follow a joint orbit, such as in the A-train. Trains\n\noffer flexibility in terms of the programmatic organization, as even various\n\ncountries can contribute to a single train, decoupling development efforts and\n\nallowing for risk mitigation. The coordination effort is moderate as compared to\n\nformations. However, the functional adequacy of a train may be much more\n\nrestricted to certain applications than that of a formation. In other words, overall\n\nresult of a train is just the sum of contributions of each single component and it is in\n\ncharge of the user to develop integrated applications. In the case of a formation,\n\neach element furnishes, in general, limited outputs, but the integrated system offers\n\nhigher order performance, not achievable differently.\n\nBeyond the classical space architectures, two new approaches are currently\n\nbeing more and more studied: swarms and fractionated spacecraft. Swarms repre-\n\nsent a multitude of identical, typically highly miniaturized spacecraft with limited\n\nfunctionality. A swarm architecture may be used e.g. for multi-point sensing. The\n\ntechnology readiness level of swarms in most of its aspects is however still very\n\nlow. In contrast, fractionation of spacecraft can be regarded as the opposite to a\n\nswarm in that its elements are heterogeneous and the functionality of a single\n\nspacecraft is broken apart and distributed among the different elements in the\n\narchitecture which make up the entire (distributed) spacecraft. Fractionation may\n\nallow for new approaches towards reliability and modularity including enhanced\n\nresponsiveness and decreased vulnerability. Its benefits and challenges are cur-\n\nrently controversially discussed. Both swarms and fractionated spacecraft are\n\ninnovative concepts in its infancy which may demonstrate their value only in the\n\ncoming two decades.\n\nDistributed space systems pose a number of system challenges. The increased\n\nthreat and awareness of space debris render a proper treatment of collision risk and\n\nend-of-life operations a crucial aspect. Access to space for distributed space\n\nsystems may benefit from a reduced-risk multiple launch approach at the expense\n\nof an increased propulsion and operations effort to acquire the nominal relative\n\nconfiguration. Legal and regulatory aspects are becoming more and more relevant\n\nand may represent challenges for distributed space systems, such as frequency\n\nallocation and coordination for complex space architectures.\n\nFinally, although the distributed system concept can be in principle applied to\n\nboth large and small spacecraft, it is naturally coupled with small satellites for a\n\nnumber of reasons: system cost, easy and rapid replacement of a failed satellite,\n\npossibility to gradually update flying technologies (which is generally an issue for\n\nlarge space systems). Generally, small satellite missions are already powerful tools\n\nto flexibly react on information requirements with space borne solutions. They can\n\nbe conducted relatively quickly and at a limited cost and provide increased\n\n666 M. D\u2019Errico et al.\n\n\n\nopportunity for access to space. The spacecraft bus and instruments can be based\n\neither on optimized off-the-shelf systems, with little or no requirements for new\n\ntechnology, or on new high-technology systems. Thus a new class of advanced\n\nsmall satellites, including autonomously operating \u201cintelligent\u201d satellites may be\n\ncreated, opening new fields of application using also distributed space systems for\n\nscientific purposes as well as operational, public and commercial services. The\n\napproach to use available off-the-shelf technology to build a small satellite system\n\n(bus and payload) for the intended remote sensing purpose results in low-cost and\n\nquick response time. In this context, the restrictions or limitations of small satellites\n\nin comparison to large complex satellites are to be considered: limited platform\n\ncapacity for using instruments with high power consumption or high data rate\n\nrequirements; size limitations when large microwave antennas or long monolithic\n\ntelescopes are necessary; restricted options for instrument combinations on a single\n\nsatellite platform because of the limited size and power capabilities of small\n\nsatellites. For these reasons small satellite missions supplement conventional\n\nEarth observation missions.\n\nThe alternative approach is taking full advantage of the ongoing technology\n\ndevelopments leading to further miniaturization of engineering components, devel-\n\nopment of micro-technologies for sensors, instruments, and spacecraft bus\n\ncomponents. At the extreme end of the miniaturization, the integration of micro-\n\nelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with microelectronics for data processing,\n\nsignal conditioning, power conditioning, and communications leads to the concept\n\nof application specific integrated micro-instruments (ASIM). These micro- and\n\nnano-technologies have led to the concepts of nano- and pico-satellites, constructed\n\nby stacking wafer-scale ASIMs together with solar cells and antennas on the\n\nexterior surface, enabling the concept of space sensor webs.\n\nFurther milestones in the small satellite, low-cost distributed space systems\n\ndevelopments are the availability and improvement of small launchers, the devel-\n\nopment of small ground station networks connected with rapid and cost-effective\n\ndata distribution methods, and cost-effective management and quality assurance\n\nprocedures.\n\nIn conclusion, distributed systems integrating a small number of spacecraft have\n\nreached a well assessed maturity in many fields, primarily bistatic SAR and\n\ngravimetry. For these systems, technology maturity has also been consistently\n\ndemonstrated by already flown missions.\n\nNew research and technology developments and proof-of-concept experiments\n\nare however needed to prepare future missions integrating a large number of\n\nspacecraft, which appear as an exciting challenging adventure from the engineering\n\npoint of view. Whereas, from the application point of view, further analyses are\n\nrequired to better: (a) assess the potential of distributed systems, identify (b) new\n\nproducts for the user community and (c) application areas with major benefits from\n\na distributed system concept. Increased communication and cooperation between\n\nscientists, data users, and engineers would represent an important step forward to\n\nfacilitate a mutual understanding of application needs and system and technology\n\ncapabilities.\n\n23 Future Trend, Potential, Risks 667\n\n\n\nIndex\n\nA\n\nAfternoon train, 378, 380\n\nAlong track inteferometry (ATI), 11, 45,\n\n77\u201379, 83, 89, 94, 111, 112, 115,\n\n388\u2013390, 396, 432, 442, 443,\n\n447, 452, 455\u2013457, 459, 468, 492,\n\n505, 662\n\nAmbiguity, 15, 67, 141, 190, 232, 300, 339,\n\n389, 438, 459, 486, 512, 531, 607\n\nAntenna, 4, 63, 141, 189, 230, 311, 335, 356,\n\n377, 388, 437, 448, 474, 510, 528, 555,\n\n604, 646, 662\n\nAqua, 376, 380\n\nArchitecture, 9, 64, 114, 211, 248, 258, 260,\n\n311, 316, 317, 319, 320, 323, 325,\n\n347\u2013348, 355\u2013359, 361, 363, 365, 366,\n\n369, 383, 396\u2013399, 445, 448, 532, 536,\n\n540, 541, 579, 580, 582, 592, 604\u2013606,\n\n610, 640, 642, 643, 650, 657, 659, 663,\n\n665, 666\n\nAstrium Ltd, 474, 475\n\nATI.
