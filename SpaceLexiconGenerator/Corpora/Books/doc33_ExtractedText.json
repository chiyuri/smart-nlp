It required,\nhowever, the advent of the GPS satellite constellation to provide a suitable source of radio signals for\nglobal and continuous monitoring. Some of the most important missions carried aboard GPS-RO\nnowadays are GPS/MET, CHAMP, COSMIC, and the GRAS instrument onboard MetOp:\n\n\u2022 The GPS/MET experiment managed by UCAR demonstrated the potential of using RO to sound\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere using the Microlab-1 minisatellite (1995e97).\n\n\u2022 The Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) was a German polar orbiting satellite mission\n(2000e10) managed by the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam, intended for atmospheric\nand ionospheric research, including a GPS RO experiment (Heise et al., 2008; Pavelyev et al.,\n2011).\n\n\u2022 The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) is a\njoint-venture between the United States and Taiwan, and it is the first operational mission\nconstellation carrying GPS RO payloads for space weather. Launched in 2006, it consisted of six\nsatellites in different orbital planes at 700e800 km height, 72? inclination, 30? spacing between\nthem in terms of the right ascension of ascending node, and 45? spacing in mean anomaly\nbetween adjacent orbital planes (Fong et al., 2009). COSMIC can be considered as the first\nGNSS-RO operational mission. Due to the success of COSMIC-1, US agencies and Taiwan have\ndecided to move forward with a follow-on RO mission (called FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2a)\nthat will launch six satellites into low-inclination orbits in 2017, and another six satellites\n(COSMIC-2b) into high-inclination orbits after 2020.\n\n\u2022 MetOp is a series of three polar orbiting meteorological satellites (MetOp-A, launched in 2006;\nMetOp-B, launched in 2012; and MetOp-C scheduled for 2018) operated by the European\nOrganization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT).

Among the 11 scientific\ninstruments, MetOp carries the Global Navigation Satellite System Receiver for Atmospheric\nSounding (GRAS) (Bonnedal et al., 2010b; Carlstrom et al., 2012).\n\nThe \u201cCOSMIC\u201d program [http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/] has initiated the acquisition and pro-\ncessing of data from additional missions beyond the COSMIC mission: the USAF C/NOFS-CORISS\n(Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System-C/NOFS Occultation Receiver for Ionospheric\nSensing and Specification) mission, the Argentinian SAC-C mission (as of August 2014 suspended due\nto a spacecraft power anomaly), the USeGerman GRACE mission, the German TerraSAR-X mission,\nand the Korean KOMPSAT-5 mission.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that all these experiments and missions use right-hand circularly\npolarized (RHCP) antennas to receive the direct GPS signal.

In July 1991 an\nincident with a French Alpha jet aircraft testing a GPS receiver showed that GPS navigation signals\nscattered off the sea surface could be collected and tracked (Aubert et al., 1994). In 1993, the concept\nof reflectometry using GNSS-R signals was proposed for mesoscale altimetry to reduce the revisit time\n(Martin-Neira, 1993) (Fig. 6.1). Later, in 1996 GNSS-R was proposed as a way to correct for the\nionospheric delay errors in ocean altimetry (Katzberg and Garrison, 1996).\n\nIn the 90s the first GPS-R observations from an aircraft were collected using an ad hoc receiver\n(Garrison and Katzberg, 1997, 2000), the first GPS-R data were \u201cfound\u201d in segments of SIR-C data\nacquired in 1994 when radar returns were not present (Lowe et al., 2002a) (Fig. 6.2), and in 2005 GPS-R\n\nFIGURE 6.1\n\nPARIS concept (Passive Reflectometry and Interferometry System) (Mart??n-Neira, 1993).\n\nFrom ESA, The figure 15: \u201cOverall system configuration realising the PARIS concept.\u201d from Martin-Neira, M., 1993.

Just to cite a few\nmilestones, the ESA sponsored OPPSCAT 1 and 2 and PARIS-a, -b, and -g projects laid the foun-\ndations for GNSS-R scatterometry, ocean altimetry, and radio occultations (GNSS-RO). Other ap-\nplications include ice monitoring, ionospheric TEC sounding, etc.\n\nMore recently, in 2012, NASA selected the CYGNSS mission, a constellation of eight micro-\nsatellites in low inclination orbit for hurricane monitoring (https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/\nsatellite-missions/c-missions/cygnss), and ESA selected the GEROS experiment on board the Inter-\nnational Space Station to perform polarimetric conventional and interferometric GNSS-R and GNSS-\nRO (Wickert et al., 2011).\n\nIn 2016, around 90 operational GNSS satellites from several systems are in orbit including GPS,\nGlonass, Beidou, Galileo, etc., but in 5 years, this number will reach more than 120, including a\nnumber of Space Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), such as Japan\u2019s Quasi-Zenith Satellite\nSystem (QZSS) and India\u2019s Regional Navigation Satellite Systems (IRNSS). With so many satellites\ntransmitting signals of opportunity, the number of simultaneous signals being received is very large\n(Fig. 6.3). Therefore, the distinctive feature of remote sensing using these highly precise and\ncontinuous signals is in an unbeatable inherent wide swath (?1000 km, as illustrated in Fig. 6.1), and\nshort revisit time.\n\nFIGURE 6.3\n\nNumber of simultaneously reflected GPS\u00fe GLONASS satellites as a function of the latitude coordinate of their\nspecular point on the Earth surface, as computed from a receiver orbiting at 800 km altitude and a 72?\n\ninclination (GPS and GLONASS constellation as in March 18, 2012).

Its signal structure was designed to allow multiple\ntransmitters using the same frequency band and to have a certain tolerance to multipath and jamming, a\nserious issue for military applications, and more and more often to civilian applications as well. It was\nalso conceived to have a low power spectral density to avoid mutual interference with other microwave\nsystems, and to allow the estimation of the ionospheric delay for accurate range determination. These\nfeatures are achieved by means of spread spectrum techniques. In short, this requires a spread the\nbandwidth of the navigation signal (a biphase modulation with a symbol rate of 50 Hz) by mixing it\nwith a pseudo-random rectangular pulse train that has a much higher frequency than the data. The\nhigher the spreading frequency the higher the power spectral density decrease for a given total radiated\npower. The spreading sequences are known as pseudo-random noise (PRN), since they have auto-\ncorrelation and cross-correlation properties similar to those of Gaussian noise, but with the advantage\nthat they can be precisely generated and regenerated, since they are in essence deterministic. Each GPS\nsatellite has its own PRN code that not only allows discriminating between transmitters, but also\nachieves the required jamming and multipath resilience and provides range estimations to determine\nthe user position by triangulation.\n\nTo understand the structure and properties of the PRN codes, it is useful to consider first the case of\na pure random sequence of pulses of width sc (Fig. 6.4 and Eq. 6.1):\n\nP\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\nX\u00feN\n\nn\u00bc?N\nxn$P\n\n?\nt? n$sc\n\nsc\n\n?\n; (6.1)\n\nwhere xn takes the values ?1 with equal probability.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nchip\n\nx n\n\nFIGURE 6.4\n\nSample random sequence of pulses xn \u00bc {?1,?1,\u00fe1,\u00fe1,?1,?1,?1,\u00fe1,\u00fe1.}. Chip duration \u00bc sc.\n\n6.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM SIGNALS 459\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.4|eps\n\n\nEach individual pulse that composes the sequence is known as a \u201cchip\u201d in opposition to a \u201cbit\u201d,\nsince it does not carry any information. The autocorrelation of P(t) is approximately a triangle function\ngiven by:\n\nRp\u00f0s\u00dez^Tc\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc\n\n8><>: 1?\njsj\nTc\n\n; jsj < sc\n0; elsewhere\n\n; (6.2)\n\nwhere s is the time lag. For the L1 C/A code sc \u00bc 0.977 ms, that corresponds to 293 m (146.6 m\nround trip). As compared to conventional radar altimeters, this value is too large to ensure a satis-\nfactory range resolution for altimetry applications. Higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and larger\nbandwidth codes, with narrower autocorrelation functions (ACFs) would then be required. The actual\nPRN codes cannot be strictly speaking random, since it is necessary to regenerate the spreading\nsequence used by the transmitter at the receiver to decode the navigation signal and retrieve the\npseudo-range observable. Therefore, the PRN codes will be deterministic and periodic sequences, but\nwith autocorrelation properties similar to those of a pure random sequence.\n\nThe coarse acquisition (C/A) codes are used for the open-access civil service. They have a period of\n1 ms to allow quick signal acquisition and a length of 1023 chips. This implies a chip rate of 1.023\nMHz, and a bandwidth 2.46 MHz. C/A codes are obtained as the product of two 2n?1 long \u201cmaximal\nlength sequences\u201d (MLS) G1 and G2 generated from n-stage linear feedback shift register (LFSR), so\nthat the cross-correlation properties of the single MLS are improved. Both G1 and G2 are generated by\nLFSR of 10 stages driven by a 1.023 MHz clock. The actual satellite ID is determined by the relative\ndelay between G1 and G2. This delay is determined by the position of the two connectors of the cells\nthat compose the G2 LFSR. For example, PRN 1 is generated when taps 2 and 6 are selected, and PRN\n31 with taps 3 and 8. There are only 37 delay combinations: 32 of them are reserved for the satellites,\nand 5 are used for other applications, such as ground transmission. The code generation is summarized\nin Fig. 6.5.\n\nFIGURE 6.5\n\nGeneration of the coarse acquisition code as the product of two maximal length sequences.\n\nAdapted from Tsui, J.B.-Y., 2000.

To\ndiscriminate a weak signal surrounded by strong ones it is necessary for the autocorrelation peak of the\nweak signal to be higher than the cross-correlation peaks of the stronger signals. In the ideal case of\nusing random sequences the codes would be orthogonal and the cross-correlations zero. The used PRN\ncodes are almost orthogonal, and the cross-correlation values are as low as ?65/1023 (12.5% of the\ntime), ?1/1023 (75% of the time), or 63/1023 (12.5% of the time).\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nchip\n\nauto-correlation CA code 1\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nchip\n\ncross-correlation C/A codes 1 and 2\n\nFIGURE 6.6\n\nAutocorrelation of coarse acquisition (C/A) code 1 (top) and cross-correlation of C/A codes 1 and 2 (bottom).\n\n6.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM SIGNALS 461\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.6|eps\n\n\nThere is also a precise code (P) used for the restricted military signal. It has a chipping rate 10 times\nfaster than the C/A code (10.23 MHz) that results in a 10-fold increase of the pseudo-range observable\naccuracy. The code period is of 1 week, so that the direct acquisition of the code (i.e., the estimation of\nthe code offset) is pretty cumbersome. Therefore, to acquire the P code special data fields of the\nnavigation frames are used [Z-count and Time of Week]. To increase even more the code robustness, it\nis possible to switch the system operation to use an encrypted version of the P code, noted as P(Y). The\nC/A and P codes are modulated in-phase and quadrature on the L1 carrier as shown in Eq. (6.3):\n\nS1\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2$PC=A1\n\nq\nD\u00f0t\u00de$CA\u00f0t\u00de$cos\u00f0u1$t\u00fe f1\u00de \u00fe\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2$PP1\n\np\nD\u00f0t\u00de$P\u00f0t\u00de$sin\u00f0u1$t\u00fe f1\u00de; (6.3)\n\nwhere S1(t) is the signal transmitted by a given GPS satellite, PC=A1 is the transmitted power for the\ncivil signal at L1, and PP1 is the transmitted power for the restricted signal at L1. On L2, for a long time\nonly the P code was broadcast (Eq. 6.4):\n\nS2\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2$PP2\n\np\n$P\u00f0t\u00de$cos\u00f0u2$t\u00fe f1\u00de; (6.4)\n\nbut on April 28, 2014, the US Air Force began broadcasting civil navigation (CNAV) messages on the\nL2C and L5 signals. Prior to that, L2C and L5 provided a default message (Message Type 0) con-\ntaining no data. The L2 signal began with the launch in 2005 of GPS Block IIR(M). As of June 25,\n2014, 13 GPS satellites are broadcasting this signal, and by 2018 all 24 GPS satellites will be\nbroadcasting it.\n\nThe LC2 sequence has the same chip rate of the C/A signal, but it is composed of two PRN codes of\ndifferent length. On one side the moderate length code (CM) is 10.230 chips long, repeats every 20 ms,\nand it is modulated with navigation data. On the other side, the long code (CL) has 767.250 chips,\nrepeats every 1.5 s and has no data modulation. Both CM and CL codes are generated using the same\n27-state LFSR, which is restarted every one CM or CL period. The initial state of the LFSR determines\nthe ID of the satellite the generated code belongs to. Each code is generated at 511.5 kHz and then\nmultiplexed on a chip-by-chip basis to obtain the composite signal at a rate of 1.023 chips/s. A detailed\ndescription can be found in Fontana et al. (2001).\n\nNavigation information such as ephemeris, almanacs, or corrections and constellation health are\nconveyed by the 50 Hz biphase code D(t). All the bit/chip transitions in the C/A, P, and D codes\nare synchronous, since they are all driven by the same clock. These various signals are broadcast at\nL-band, thus suffering low atmospheric and rain attenuations. The carrier frequencies are all\nmultiples of 10.23MHz: fL1\u00bc 154$10.23MHz\u00bc 1575.42MHz; fL2\u00bc 120$10.23MHz\u00bc 1227.60MHz; and\nfL5 \u00bc 115$10.23 MHz \u00bc 1176.45 MHz.\n\nThe frequency spacing between L1 and L2 allows to estimate the ionospheric delay as:\n\nDt1 \u00bc f\n2\n2\n\nf 21 ? f 22\n$d Dt\u00f0 \u00de; (6.5)\n\nwhere Dt1 is the time delay at the frequency L1 due to the ionosphere, f1 and f2 are the L1 and L2\nfrequencies, and d(Dt) is the measured time difference between frequencies f1 and f2.\n\nThe minimum received power (PR) is computed using the standard propagation equation:\n\nPR \u00bc PT$GT$ 1\n4pR2\n\n$Aeff$L; (6.6)\n\n462 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\n\n\nwhere PT is the transmitted power, GT is the gain of the transmitting antenna, 1/4pR\n2 are the\n\npropagation losses, Aeff is the effective area of the receiving antenna\n\nAeff \u00bc l\n2\n\n4p\n$GR; (6.7)\n\nand L are the losses in the atmosphere and other media between transmitter and receiver. Assuming an\nisotropic receiving antenna (GR \u00bc 0 dBi), Table 6.2 summarizes the received power and SNR.\n\nThe L1 P signal is?133 dBm for a 0 dBic RHCP antenna. At L1 the C/A signal is 3 dB higher than\nthe P signal (minimum received power of ?130 dBm). At L2 the P code is transmitted 3 dB below the\nL1 P signal. The SNR for the direct signal ranges between 39 dBHz and 52 dBHz, depending on the\ngeometry, the actual transmitted power, and the instrumental and propagation losses. Within the GPS\nsatellite antenna field of view (FOV), the different signal attenuation due to different propagation\nlosses and atmospheric absorption is compensated by the pattern itself of the transmitting antenna.\nMore specifically, the edge of the Earth is 14? off the antenna boresight, and therefore the pattern\nmaximum is located at this angle. The transmitted signal is RHCP, and so it is immune to the at-\nmospheric Faraday rotation and the receiving antenna does not have to be pointing to the transmitting\nsatellite to avoid polarization mismatch.\n\nThe new L5 signal designed for Safety of Life applications is broadcast in a radio band reserved\nexclusively for aviation safety services. It features higher power, larger bandwidth, and an advanced\nsignal design including two in-phase and quadrature multiplexed signals: a navigation data channel\nand a data-free channel to allow a more robust carrier phase tracking. It began in 2010 with GPS Block\nIIF, as of June 25, 2014 six GPS satellites are broadcasting this signal, and it will be available for all 24\nGPS satellites by 2021 (http://www.gps.gov/).\n\nOther satellite navigation systems such as Galileo share the same frequency bands, as illustrated\nby Fig. 6.7, but the PRN sequences are not necessarily generated using shift registers, but instead\n\nTable 6.2 GPS Typical Received Signal Level and C/N0\n\nParameter Symbol Value Units\n\nTransmitter power (C/A\ncode)\n\nPT 14.3 dBW\n\nTransmitting antenna\ngain\n\nGT 10.2 dB\n\nAtmospheric loss L ?2 dB\nSpace loss @\nR \u00bc 20,200 km\n\n?157.1 dBm?2\n\nPower density at\nreceiver\n\nPD ?134.6 dBWm?2\n\nEffective area of\nisotropic antenna\n\n?25.4 dBWm2\n\nReceiving antenna gain GR 0 dB\n\nReceived power PR L160.0 dBW\n\nNoise spectrum N0 ?204 dBW/Hz\nCarrier-to-noise ratio C/N0 44 dB-Hz\n\n6.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM SIGNALS 463\n\nhttp://www.gps.gov/\n\n\nFIGURE 6.7\n\nFrequency bands used by the different GNSS systems (http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/GNSS_signal).\n\n464 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.7|tif\nhttp://www.navipedia.net/index.php/GNSS_signal\n\n\nlook-up tables. Also, advanced modulation techniques (Binary Offset Carrier Signals or BOC) are used\nto increase the achievable accuracy with the same bandwidth (http://www.gsc-europa.eu/gnss-markets/\nsegments-applications/os-sis-icd). The BOCmodulation is the result of multiplying the PRN code with a\nsubcarrier, which is equal to the sign of a sine or a cosine waveform, yielding so-called sine-phased or\ncosine-phased BOC signals respectively as shown in J.W. Betz (2001).

The magnitude of the refraction depends\non the refractivity gradient normal to the path, which in turn depends on the density and water vapor\ncontent gradients. This effect is more important when the radiation traverses a long atmospheric limb\npath.\n\nThis effect at optical frequencies is illustrated in Fig. 6.9. When the Sun is on the horizon, or close\nto it, refraction in the lower atmosphere is more important and it appears to flatten the solar disk.\nSunlight directed from the bottom portion of the Sun passes through a slightly denser atmosphere than\ndo rays coming from the Sun\u2019s upper portion and refraction is more important.\n\nAt radio frequencies the bending angle (a), or total change in ray direction with respect to a signal\npath trajectory through free space (Fig. 6.10), is w1?e2? at the surface, falling exponentially with\nheight, and it cannot be measured directly. The amount of bending can be related to the refractive index\nby using an Abel transform on the formula relating bending angle to refractivity (Section 6.2.3). In the\ncase of the neutral atmosphere (below the ionosphere) information on the atmosphere\u2019s temperature,\npressure, and water vapor content can be derived, leading to RO data applications in meteorology, with\ngood vertical resolution (w100e200 m), broad horizontal resolution (w70% of the bending occurs\nover a w450 km section of the ray-path, centered on the tangent point), quasi-instantaneous obser-\nvations (a radio-link with tangent point at w60 km altitude, to a link with tangent point at the surface\nlevel takes only w2 min, during this time, the tangent point has drifted horizontally w150 km).\n\nFIGURE 6.9\n\nImages of the Sun distorted due to refraction.\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sunset_mirage_and_green_flash_9-28-10.jpg.\n\n468 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.9|tif\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sunset_mirage_and_green_flash_9-28-10.jpg\n\n\nAccording to Fig. 6.10, and applying Snell\u2019s law at each infinitesimal layer of the atmosphere, at\nany point along the ray with index of refractivity n(r), being r the radial distance, and q(r) the ray angle\nwith respect to the radial, Eq.

A rising occultation occurs when a transmitter signal blocked by the Earth\ngradually comes up above the limb [from (https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-\nmissions/m/metop-sg)].\n\nThe so-called Level-1 data consist of a time series of \u201cexcess phase delay\u201d and the \u201cSNR\u201d of the\nradio-link. The higher the index of refraction (n > 1), the slower the propagation speed and the\ngreater the path length, which produces an \u201cexcess phase\u201d or difference between the total measured\nphase delay of the bent radio-link and the delay corresponding to a straight signal propagation between\nthe transmitter and the receiver.\n\nThe bending of the path also modifies the apparent Doppler frequency, which produces an \u201cexcess\nDoppler\u201d frequency shift that is obtained by differentiating the excess phase delays (Df) with respect\nto time:\n\nfD \u00bc ? f0\nc\n\nvTr $cos q\nT\n\n? ?\u00fe vTq$sin qT? ?\u00fe vRr $cos qR? ?? vRq $sin qR? ?\t \n; (6.15)\n\nGNSS\n\nuG uL\n\nvL\n\nvG\n\nRG\n\nRay path\n\nRay perigee\n(or Ray tangent point)\n\nAltitude or\nRay Path Tangent Height\n\nSLTA\n\nb\n\nLEO\n\nEarth\n(WGS-84)\n\nRE\nRL\n\npG pL\n\n? ?\n\nFIGURE 6.10\n\nGeometry of GNSS radio occultations.

(6.31)\n\n6.3.2 GNSS-RO INSTRUMENTS\nGNSS-RO instruments are basically very sensitive GNSS (or GPS only) receivers that can provide very\nhigh sampling rates, up to 50 Hz, for accurate phase measurements.\n\nThe development of GPS-RO instruments starts in the US with the GPS/MET mission in the mid\n90\u2019s. In 1998, JPL started developing a new class of high-precision GPS space science receivers, called\nBlackJack, a configuration of the NASA/JPL dual-frequency codeless TurboRogue Space Receiver\n(TRSR) to perform radio occultations that could take precise measurements of how GPS signals are\ndelayed along their way to the receiver. BlackJack GPS flight instruments have been used in 2000 on\nSRTM, SAC-C, CHAMP, JASON-1, etc., in 2001 on FEDSat, ICESat, and GRACE. In 2006, the\nConstellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) was launched\nthrough a collaboration among Taiwan\u2019s National Science Council and National Space Organization,\nthe US National Science Foundation, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA), and other Federal entities. COSMIC was the first demonstration of a GPS RO constellation,\nand its primary payload was the so-called \u201cintegrated GPS Occultation Receiver\u201d or IGOR, based on\nNASA/JPL BlackJack receiver (see Fig. 6.12). Pyxis is the next generation of GNSS-RO instruments\nbased on the evolution of IGOR. It includes L2C and L5 frequencies as well, and eventually Galileo\nfrequencies provide increased occultation data and improved PVT resolution. The next generation of\nUS GNSS-RO instruments (Tri-G) will have the capability to track both the legacy GPS L1CA and\nL1 \u00fe L2 semicodeless and the new L2C/L5 signals from GPS, as well as additional new GNSS\nsignals, such as GLONASS (CDMA) and Galileo (E1, E5), and will have digital beam steering antenna\ncapability, more channels and memory, and \u201cwider\u201d open loop tracking function.\n\nIn Europe, Saab Ericsson Space (now RUAG), ESA, and EUMETSAT developed the GRAS\n(GNSS-RO Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding) for Metop A to C satellites, and THALES developed\nROSA (radio occultation sounder for atmosphere) for OCEANSAT (India), and SAC-D (Argentina).\n\n472 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThese receivers are based in the AGGA (Advanced GPS/GLONASS and Galileo ASIC) device\ndeveloped by ESA within the Earth Observation Preparatory Program (EOPP) to support the Earth\nobservation applications of navigation signals. The AGGA is available to all European space in-\ndustries, and it is flying or will fly in a large number of ESA missions (e.g., GRAS instrument in Metop\nA to C for GNSS-RO, or GOCE, Swarm, EarthCare, GMES Sentinels 1, 2, 3 for POD), and non-ESA\nmissions (e.g., Radarsat-2 and Cosmo-Skymed for precise orbit determination or POD, and ROSA in\nOceansat-2, SAC-D, and MegaTropiques for GNSS-RO). The next generation of GNSS-RO\ninstruments will benefit from open loop processing techniques, already demonstrated in MetOp\nsince 2007, for improved range and Doppler modeling, better open loop with new open CDMAGNSS\nsignals (GPS, Galileo, Glonass, Beidou), and no need for codeless techniques, and larger coverage up\nto w2600 observations per satellite and day.\n\nTable 6.4 summarizes the past, current, and planned GNSS-RO instruments, including the name of\nthe mission where they were flown, the instrument full name, and a short description of the instrument\nheritage.\n\n6.3.3 GNSS-RO APPLICATIONS\n6.3.3.1 Atmospheric Profiles of Temperature, Pressure, and Water Vapor\nSolving the aforementioned equations, atmospheric excess phases and atmospheric profiles of bending\nangle, refractivity, dry temperature, temperature, and water vapor are inferred, and routinely distrib-\nuted.

The largest impact is from AMSU-A, the primary mi-\ncrowave sounder on NOAA\u2019s polar orbiting satellites. GNSS-RO (actually GPS-RO) is essentially tied\nfor second with two infrared (IR) sounders. However, it should be noted that AMSU and IR perfor-\nmance is significantly improved by the calibration using GNSS-RO data. Without GNSS-RO, bars will\nbe smaller, therefore the true impact of GNSS-RO is much larger than this plot induces to think, and\nthis improvement comes from a system that is at least two orders of magnitude less expensive than\nmicrowave sounders.\n\nTable 6.4 Summary Table of GNSS-RO Instruments Acronyms and Full Name, Missions,\nand Heritage\n\nInstrument Acronym (Mission/Satellite) Instrument Full Name\n\nLegacy Instruments\n\nBlackJack (CHAMP) BlackJack (configuration of the NASA/JPL TurboRogue\nSpace Receiver to perform radio occultations)\n\nGOLPE (SAC-C) GPS Occultation and Passive reflection Experiment\n(adaptation of the NASA/JPL BlackJack)\n\nGPS/MET (OrbView-1, formerly MicroLab) Global Positioning System/Meteorology\n\nIGOR (TacSat-2) Integrated GPS Occultation Receiver (based on NASA\u2019s\nBlackJack)\n\nCurrent Instruments\n\nAOPOD (KOMPSAT-5) Atmosphere Occultation and Precision Orbit\nDetermination\n\nBlackJack (GRACE) BlackJack\n\nCORISS (Communication/Navigation Outage\nForecasting System)\n\nC/NOFS Occultation Receiver for Ionospheric Sensing\nand Specification (dual-frequency, tracking during\nrising, and setting)\n\nGNOS (Feng-Yun - 3C) GNSS Radio Occultation Sounder\n\nGRAS (MetOp A to C) GNSS Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding\n\nIGOR (COSMIC, TanDEM, TerraSAR) Integrated GPS Occultation Receiver\n\nROSA (SAC-D, OceanSat) Radio Occultation Sounder of the Atmosphere\n\nTRSR (\u00d8rsted) TurboRogue Space Receiver (\u00d8rsted)\n\nFuture Instruments\n\nGNSS-RO (CLARREO) Global Navigation Satellite System-Radio Occultation\n\nRadiomet (Meteor-3M) Radio Occultation sounder\n\nRO (GRAS follow-on of MetOp A to C) Radio Occultation sounder (follow-on of GRAS flown\non MetOp A to C)\n\nROHPP (PAZ) Radio Occultations and Heavy Precipitation with PAZ\n(PAZ)\n\nTri-G (COSMIC-2, GRACE-FO, JASON-CS) Triple G: GPS, Galileo, GLONASS (COSMIC-2 and\nGRACE-2)\n\n474 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\n\n\nFIGURE 6.13\n\nSample water vapor and temperature height distributions as derived from COSMIC.\n\nFrom http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/data.html.\n\nFIGURE 6.14\n\nForecast contribution to error reduction from different sensors: GPS RO is essentially tied for second with two\n\ninfrared sounders (http://geooptics.com/?page_id\u00bc9).\n\n6.3 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEMdRADIO OCCULTATIONS 475\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.13|tif\nhttp://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/data.html\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.14|tif\nhttp://geooptics.com/?page_id=9\nhttp://geooptics.com/?page_id=9\n\n\n6.3.3.3 Ionosphere\nThe ionospheric total electron content (TEC) can be inferred from the phase delay Li of the occulting\nradio link at frequency band fi [Hz], which depends on the integrated path length of the link (si), and the\nTEC [e?/m3] to be determined (Ruffini et al., 1998):\n\nLi \u00bc si ?\n40:3082\n\nm3\n\ns2\n\nf 2i\n$TECi.

(6.33)\n\nIonospheric excess phases, S4 scintillation index, and ionospheric profiles of electron density can\nalso be inferred and are currently distributed (Fig. 6.15).\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY\nGNSS Reflectrometry, or GNSS-R in short, can be understood in radar terminology as a \u201cpassive\nbistatic radar\u201d: passive because it operates with transmitters of opportunity, and bistatic (actually\nmultistatic) because transmitter(s) and receiver are separated by a considerable distance. Although the\nvery first radars were already bistatic, because of the difficulty to implement the duplexers to separate\nthe transmitted and received signals, most of the existing radar technology is for monostatic radars.\nBistatic radars have experienced, though, a number or revivals, in the 50s for semiactive homing\nmissiles., in the 70se80s with the sanctuary project ., and since the mid 90s using opportunity\nsignals such as GNSS or TV signals.\n\nThe GNSS-R concept is sketched in Fig. 6.16 showing a receiver in an LEO satellite collecting the\nreflected (actually scattered) signal (marked in red) of four different navigation satellites, and\n(eventually) the direct signals as well (marked in orange, dashed line). Depending on the application,\nGNSS-R instruments can be operated in different \u201cmodes\u201d:\n\n\u2022 as a scatterometer: when the observable is the amplitude of the (forward) scattered power,\n\u2022 as an altimeter: when the observable is the time delay between the direct and the scattered signals\n\narriving to the receiver, or\n\u2022 as a synthetic aperture radar or SAR (actually an unfocused SAR due to the short coherent\n\nintegration time that can be achieved): when the observable is the whole delay Doppler map (or\nDDM) that can be deconvolved to derive a radar cross-section (RCS) density (s0) image or to\nperform Doppler altimetry.\n\nAlthough based on the same principles, depending on the application, the instruments have\ndifferent requirements. For example, for scatterometric purposes, bandwidth is not an issue, and a\nsingle frequency receiver suffices. On the other hand, for altimetric applications, bandwidth is an issue,\n\n476 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\n\n\nsince it determines (together with the SNR) the achievable altimetric accuracy, and dual frequency\ninstruments are needed to compensate for the ionospheric delay. Instruments measuring DDMs will be\na lot more complex, since they will require a large number of complex correlators for each delay-\nDoppler bin, while for scatterometry and altimetry applications just a few correlators are needed to\nmeasure a delay cut along the central Doppler frequency.\n\nBefore discussing the specifics of GNSS-R techniques, instruments, and applications, it is\nconvenient to review briefly some basic concepts of bistatic radar, which are needed to better un-\nderstand GNSS-R.\n\nFIGURE 6.15\n\nSample electron density height distribution as derived from COSMIC.\n\nFrom \u00a9 2013 University Corporation for Atmospheric Research / COSMIC.\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 477\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.15|tif\n\n\n6.4.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES: GNSS-R AS A MULTISTATIC RADAR\n6.4.1.1 Isodelay and Iso-Doppler Contours\nA sketch of a bistatic radar consisting of a transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) is shown in Fig. 6.17.

In Eq. (6.34) R1(t)\nis the distance between transmitter and target, and R2(t) is the distance between receiver and target.\n\nTaking as a reference the position of the receiver, and defining Rtot(t) \u00bc R1(t)\u00feR2(t), the\nequations of the ellipses are given by:\n\nR2\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc R\n2\ntot\u00f0t\u00de ?

In the particular case of a stationary (or quasi-stationary) target (e.g., the\nEarth\u2019s or the ocean surface), Eq. (6.36) becomes:\n\nfD \u00bc VT\nl\n$cos\u00f0dT ? qT\u00de \u00fe VR\n\nl\n$cos\u00f0dR ? qR\u00de; (6.37)\n\nwhere dT ? qT and dR ? qR are the angles formed by the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) ve-\nlocity vectors and the unitary vectors from transmitter and receiver to the target (bnTx?target andbnRx?target). Eq. (6.37) can be alternatively written as:\n\nfD \u00bc VR\n\n!\n\n$bnTx?target\nl\n\n\u00fe VR\n\n!\n\n$bnRx?target\nl\n\n. (6.38)\n\nFor a flat Earth, the iso-Doppler contours become hyperbolae. Fig. 6.19 shows the isodelay (or\nisorange) contours together with the iso-Doppler contours. As it can be noticed, each pixel in the (x,y)\nplane has a pair delay-Doppler (s, fD) associated, but this correspondence is not unique, since two pairs\n\nFIGURE 6.18\n\nGeometry of the isodelay contours.\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 479\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.18|tif\n\n\nof (x,y) points have the same (s, fD) values. In a SAR, this ambiguity is solved by steering the antenna\ntoward an unambiguous zone away from the y axis, but in GNSS-R, in principle, this is not the case,\nsince the antennas point toward the specular direction point (0,0). This issue will be addressed in a\nsubsequent section when dealing with GNSS-R as imagers.\n\n6.4.1.2 Received Power, Signal-to-Noise Ratios, and Ovals of Cassini\nThe received power (PR) in a bistatic radar can be computed in a similar way as for a monostatic radar,\nbut taking into account that R1 and R2 are different, and so the antenna gains of the transmitting (GT)\nand receiving antennas (GR), that must be evaluated in the direction of the target, and that the\nmonostatic RCS (s) must be replaced by the bistatic one (sb):\n\nPR \u00bc PT$GT\n4pR21|fflfflffl{zfflfflffl}\njPj\n!??\n\ntarget\n\n$sb$\n1\n\n4pR22\n\n|fflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl}\njPj!??\n\nRx\n\n$\nGR$l\n\n2\n\n4p|fflfflffl{zfflfflffl}\nAeff;Rx\n\n$L. (6.39)\n\nAdditional terms in Eq. (6.39) are PT the transmitted power, and L which includes all losses in the\ntransmitter, receiver, and propagation. In the second term of Eq. (6.39) the first part corresponds to the\n\nFIGURE 6.19\n\nGeometry of the isodelay and iso-Doppler contours overlaid: two pairs of (x,y) points have the same (s, fD)\nvalues.\n\n480 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.19|tif\n\n\nPoynting vector [power density, units W/m2] at the target, the product of the first two to the power\nactually being intercepted by the target, the product of the first three to the Poynting vector at the\nreceiving antenna, and GR$l\n\n2/4p corresponds to the effective area of the receiving antenna. Note that\nin the case of a surface target sb must be replaced by the RCS density times the surface associated to\nthe (s, fD) cell (see Fig. 6.19).\n\nThe calculation of the SNR is usually computed by dividing Eq. (6.39) by the thermal noise\nintroduced by the receiver:\n\nN \u00bc kB$Tsys$B; (6.40)\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann\u2019s constant (kB \u00bc 1.38$10?23 J/K), Tsys \u00bc TA \u00fe TR is the system\ntemperature, which includes the noise collected by the antenna (TA), and the noise generated internally\nby the receiver (TR) (see Chapter 4 for a detailed discussion on the calculation of these terms).\nHowever, in GNSS-R, the background noise (Eq. 6.40) is increased by the power within the band of\nother interfering signals, including other GNSS signals: IIntra, or intrasystem interference that is due to\nthe signals coming from satellites belonging to the same system, IInterop that is coming from a satellite\nof a different constellation, but with the same signal structure as that of the desired signal, and IInter that\nis coming from signals with a different signal structure, belonging or not to the same system\n(Navipedia, GNSS Interference Model, 2014; Wu and He, 2011). If we are now interested in finding the\ncontours of constant SNR, R1$R2 can be isolated from the ratio of Eqs. (6.39) and (6.40), leading to:\n\nR1$R2\u00f0 \u00dejmax \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\nPT$GT$GR$l\n2$sb$L\n\n4p\u00f0 \u00de3$kB$Tsys$B$SNRmin\n\ns\n\u00bc k; (6.41)\n\nor:\n\nSNR \u00bc k\nR21$R\n\n2\n2\n\n; (6.42)\n\nwith kbk2$SNRmin.\nFinally, the equation of the ovals of Cassini, or contours of constant SNR on any bistatic plane, can\n\nbe derived:\n\nR21$R\n2\n2 \u00bc\n\n?\nr2 \u00fe L\n\n2\n\n4\n\n?2\n? r2$L2$cos2q.

(6.43).\n\n6.4.1.3 Considerations on Bistatic Scattering\nDepending on the scattering configuration three different regimes must be considered to evaluate how\nwell both individual targets and the background (clutter in radar terminology, but main target in GNSS-\nR applications) scattering influences the incoming signal toward the receiver:\n\nPseudo-monostatic region. At very high frequencies (wavelength tending to zero) the bistatic RCS\n(sb) of a sufficiently smooth, a perfectly conducting target is equal to the monostatic RCS measured on\nthe bisector of the bistatic angle b (Crispin and Siegel, 1968). For spheres of radius up to w0.4 l, the\npseudo-monostatic region extends to b z 40?, but for complex targets (assembly of discrete scattering\ncenters) the extent of the pseudo-monostatic region is considerably reduced: for small bistatic angles\n(b ? 5?), the bistatic RCS is equal to the monostatic RCS measured on the bisector of the bistatic angle\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 481\n\n\n\n27\n\n30 30\n\nTx\nRx\n\n23\n\n20\n\n16\n\n13\n\nS/N = 10 dB\n\nCUSP\n\nFIGURE 6.20\n\nContours of constant SNR, or ovals of Cassini, where the baseline \u00bc L and k \u00bc 30 L.

At b > 5? the change in the radiation properties from\ndiscrete scattering centers will likely dominate over any cos (b/2) frequency reduction term (Kell, 1965).\n\nBistatic RCS Region. Changes in the relative phase between discrete scattering centers, radiation\nchanges from individual scattering centers, and appearance/disappearance of scattering centers produce a\nbistatic RCS pattern more complex than the monostatic one that, in general, is of lower amplitude.\n\nForward-scattering region. When the bistatic angle approaches 180? the RCS can be very large,\neven for perfectly absorbing targets since, according to Babinet\u2019s principle, a perfectly absorbing target\nof area Awill produce the same RCS as a target-shaped hole in an infinite ground plane. The bistatic RCS\nis sb \u00bc 4pA2\n\n?\nl2, and the roll off away from b \u00bc 180?, is a uniformly illuminated antenna aperture,\n\nwith an angular width of the order of l/d radians, being d the maximum dimension of the target.\nAs a rough approximation (depends very much on the target) the pseudo-monostatic region is valid\n\nfor b ? 5? and can be applied for near-nadir applications, the bistatic region is valid in the range\nfrom 5? < b ? 175? and will usually cover most of the angular range used in GNSS-R\naltimetry/scatterometry applications, and the forward-scattering region is valid for 175? <\nb ? 180? and will be valid in scattering at near-grazing angles, such as those occurring in GNSS-RO.\nThe bistatic RCS of the clutter (background) is defined as sc \u00bc s0b$Ac; where s0B [m2/m2] is the\nscattering coefficient. In the pseudo-monostatic region, it can be approximated by:\n\ns0Bz e\n?\n?\nbc\nss\n\n?2\n; (6.44)\n\nwhere bcbj90? ? \u00f0qi \u00fe qs\u00de=2j and ss is the rms surface slope.\n\n482 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.20|eps\n\n\nIn the bistatic region the constant-g model is used:\n\ns0Bzg$\u00f0sin\u00f0qi\u00de$sin\u00f0qs\u00de\u00de1=2. (6.45)\nFinally, in the forward-scattering region the scattering is nearly specular. Actually, the ratio of the\n\nreflected to the direct powers is one of the observables in GNSS-RO. In Pavelyev et al. (2011), a study\nis performed to predict the GNSS reflections and ROs in GNSS-RO scenarios. Results in Fig. 6.21\nshow the reflection coefficients at near grazing angles for RHCP and left hand circular polarizations\n(LHCP), when the incident wave is a pure RHCP wave. Note that for LHCP, the reflection coefficient\nvanishes for j \u00bc 0?.\n\n6.4.1.4 Woodward Ambiguity Function\nThe Woodward ambiguity function (WAF) (Woodward, 1980) shows the point target response of the\nwaveform as a function of delay s and Doppler frequency fD:\n\njc s; fD\u00f0 \u00dej \u00bc\n????

However, in the GNSS-R case, the definition in Eq. (6.46) suffices since the Doppler\nis dominated by the movement of the transmitter and/or receiver, while the target is still or moves\n\nFIGURE 6.21\n\nThe reflection coefficient as a function of the grazing angle j for the case of the right hand (RHCP) and left\n\nhand (LHCP) circular polarizations of a GNSS-RO receiving antenna.\n\nFrom Pavelyev, A.G., Zhang, K., Matyugov, S.S., Liou, Y.A., Wang, C.S., Yakovlev, O.I., Kucherjavenkov, I.A., Kuleshov, Y., 2011.\n\nAnalytical model of bistatic reflections and radio occultation signals.

Since the\nreflected signal is of even weaker amplitude than the direct signal (the one of interest for navigation\npurposes), the signal-to-(thermal) noise ratio is even poorer. In addition, since the scattered signal\ncomes from multiple scatterers over the surface with different phases within the resolution cell, it also\nsuffers from speckle noise,1 and a large number of incoherent averages (Ni) are required to improve the\nSNR of Yc;i;r\u00f0t; s; fd\u00de: D??Yc;i;r\u00f0s; fd\u00de??2Ez 1\n\nNi\n\nXNi\nn\u00bc1\n\n??Yc;i;r\u00f0tn; s; fd\u00de??2.

(6.53) is simply the received power by a bistatic\n\nradar (to be compared to Eq. 6.39) from all the points in the surface where the incident wave is\nscattered. The following considerations must be made.\n\n1Speckle noise is a \u201cmultiplicative noise\u201d also found in other imaging instruments with a coherent illumination source, such\nas SARs. It is caused by the coherent sum of the scattered waves in many different \u201cfacets\u201d of the surface with different\nphases. Speckle noise is especially significant in ocean and it can only be reduced by incoherent averaging.\n2Increasing the coherent integration time (Tc) increases the SNR, but it cannot be increased indefinitely, due to the temporal\ndecorrelation of the surface where the reflection takes place. This will be explained later in more detail in Section 6.4.3.\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 485\n\n\n\n6.4.2.1 The Woodward Ambiguity Function\nThe WAF jcj2 is maximum around surface points that satisfy that the delay and Doppler are:\n\nsz\nR1\u00f0 r!\u00de \u00fe R2\u00f0 r!\u00de\n\nc\n; (6.54a)\n\nand\n\nfDz fc. (6.54b)\n\nAway from these points, jcj2 vanishes and it is almost zero, although there are residual contri-\nbutions away from them. The resolution cells or \u201cdelay-Doppler\u201d bins are then the regions where the\nWAF is larger than half its peak value (see Fig. 6.22). The isodelay and iso-Doppler contours for a\nbistatic configuration are depicted in Fig. 6.23. Two \u201cambiguous\u201d delay-Doppler bins with the same\ndelay and Doppler are marked with different gray levels.3 The shape of these contours is dominated by\nthe dynamics of the LEO satellites (much faster than the MEO ones), or by the MEO ones (where most\nof the GNSS are) in airborne or ground-based instruments.\n\nThe shape of the WAF for the GNSS signals can be computed using Eq. (6.46). However, in the\ncomputation of Eq. (6.53), the error committed is negligible if the time and frequency dependencies\nare separated. In this case, the WAF can be approximated by the product of their ACFs (see\n\nx\n\ny\n\nPs\n\n>70 Hz/km  Code ~10 km\n\nVr\n\nFIGURE 6.23\n\nIsodelay and iso-Doppler contours for a bistatic configuration.

The only way to\nresolve it is by steering the beam off the specular reflection point direction, and attenuate the alias pixel with the antenna\npattern or by a multilook processing.\n\n486 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.23|eps\n\n\nFig. 6.9 and Section 6.2) and the sinc( f$Tc).

A number of models exist to predict s0 over the ocean\nsurface more accurately than the simple qualitative expressions given in Section 6.4.1.3.\n\n6.4.2.2.1 Kirchhoff Model Under the Stationary Phase Approximation\nThis approximation is also known as the tangent plane. This means that scattering occurs only for\npoints on the surface for which there are specular reflection, and local diffraction effects are\nexcluded.\n\ns0\u00f0 r!\u00de \u00bc p$k2j<j2 $ q\n2\n\nq4z\n$ P\n?\nZx;Zy\n\n?\n; (6.56)\n\nwhere k \u00bc 2p/l is the electromagnetic wave number, < is the Fresnel reflection coefficient (actually\nit is <pq to indicate the incident polarization \u201cq\u201d and the scattered polarization \u201cp\u201d),\nq!\u00bc qx$bx \u00fe qy$by \u00fe qz$bzb k$?bks ? bki?, q \u00bc ?? q!??, and P (Zx,Zy) is the probability density function\nof the surface slopes along the x- and y-directions (Zx and Zy) and can be obtained from the sea surface\nwave spectrum or from the slopes statistics (e.g., Cox and Munk, 1954).4\n\nSince navigation systems use RHCP to avoid ionospheric effects and antenna pointing re-\nquirements at receiver level, the Fresnel reflections coefficients to be used in Eq.

(6.58b)\n6.4.2.2.2 Kirchhoff Model Under the Physical Optics Approximation\nThe Kirchhoff model under the physical optics approximation involves the integration of the scattered\nfields over the entire rough surface, not just the facets contributing to the specular reflection. Unlike the\ngeometric optics approximation, the physical optics approximation predicts a coherent component\ngiven by:\n\ns0; cohpq \u00bc pk2ja0j2d\u00f0qx\u00ded\n?\nqy\n?\ne?q\n\n2\nz$s\n\n2\n\n; (6.59)\n\nwhich decreases with increasing rms surface roughness (s). In the specular direction\na0,VV \u00bc \u00fe2<VV(qi)$cos(qi), a0,HH \u00bc ?2<HH(qi)$cos(qi), and a0,VH \u00bc a0,HV \u00bc 0. However,\nthis analysis is limited to surfaces with small slopes (Ticconi et al., 2011).\n\n6.4.2.2.3 The Small Perturbation Method\nThe Small Perturbation Method (SPM) is based on finding a solution in terms of a series of plane\nwaves that matches the surface boundary conditions, i.e., the tangential component of the field must be\ncontinuous across the boundary. The zeroth order term in the expansion corresponds to the surface field\nif the surface was flat. The SMP is a good model if the surface height standard deviation is much less\nthan the incident wavelength, and the average surface slope is comparable to or less than the surface\nstandard deviation times the wave number. To first order, the SPM does not account for multiple\nscattering, but it does to some extent in the higher order solutions. It is the most appropriate model to\naccount for Bragg scattering and polarimetric effects.\n\n6.4.2.2.4 The Two-Scale Model\nThe Two-Scale Model decomposes the surface roughness in two scales: the large scale roughness,\nwhich is modeled using the Kirchhoff approximation under the geometric optics (KAGO), and the\nsmall scale roughness, which are modeled using the SPM averaged over the statistics of the tilt of the\nlarge-scale roughness (Bass and Fuks, 1979; Valenzuela, 1978).\n\n6.4.2.2.5 The Integral Equation Model\nThe Integral Equation Model (IEM) is a unifying method proposed in the mid 80s (Fung and Pan,\n1986) that closes the gap between the Kirchhoff method and the SPM, being able to reproduce results\nof these two methods in appropriate limits. The method is accurate, but very intensive computationally,\nand it is used as a reference to check the accuracy of other methods.\n\n6.4.2.2.6 The Small Slope Approximation\nIn the mid-1980s, Voronovich (1985) proposed the Small Slope Approximation (SSA) that is valid for\nany wavelength, and arbitrary roughness provided that the surface slopes are smaller than the angles of\nincidence and scattering. As the IEM, the SSA closes the gap between the Kirchhoff approximation\nand the SPM. In 1996 (Voronovich, 1996), the nonlocal SSAwas proposed as an extension to situations\nin which multiple scattering from points situated at significant distance becomes important.\n\n488 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\n\n\nCalculations have shown a good agreement between the KAGO and the SSA methods for the\nLHCP scattered around the nominal specular direction. Because of its simplicity, the Kirchhoff\nmodel in the geometric optics limits is the one most often used in GNSS-R. However, the SSA\ncalculations for the RHCP scattered signal show that Bragg scattering has to be accounted for, even at\nthe specular direction. Therefore, for polarimetric studies, the KAGO method is not valid, and the\nSSA must be used instead. Table 6.5 summarizes the limitations and applicability of different\nscattering models revised.\n\n6.4.3 THERMAL NOISE, SPECKLE, AND COHERENCE TIME\n6.4.3.1 Simplified Approach\nSince the two applications of GNSS-R are scatterometry and altimetry, our study will be focused in the\ndetermination of the SNR of the observables and in the determination of the delay estimation error.\n\nThe SNR (thermal noise only) at the input of the correlator is given by:\n\nSNR \u00bc\nPR s; fd\u00f0 \u00de ? jc s; fd\u00f0 \u00dej2\nh i\nkB$T$min B; BISf g ; (6.60)\n\nwhere PR is the total received reflected power, c is the WAF of the transmitted signal, kB is the\nBoltzmann\u2019s constant, T is the equivalent system\u2019s noise temperature, and B and BIS are the baseband\nbandwidths of the receiver\u2019s filter and the transmitted signal accordingto the IS documents.\n\nFor a conventional GNSS-R (cGNSS-R) instrument, in which the scattered signal is cross-correlated\nwith a locally generated replica of the transmitted signal, the SNR at correlator\u2019s output is also given by\nEq. (6.60), but replacing min {B, BIS} by the inverse of the coherent correlation time (1/Tc).\n\nTable 6.5 Limitations and Applicability of Different Scattering Models\n\nMethod Limitations\n\nKA \u00b7 Surface correlation length larger than the electromagnetic\nwavelength, and\n\n\u00b7 Surface mean radius of curvature larger than the electromagnetic\nwavelength\n\nKGO \u00b7 Large standard deviation of the surface height compared to the\nelectromagnetic wavelength (high-frequency limit)\n\nKPO \u00b7 Small vertical-scale roughness and\n\u00b7 Small slope statistics\n\nSPM \u00b7 Standard deviation of the sea surface height smaller than\nelectromagnetic wavelength, and\n\n\u00b7 Surface correlation length smaller than electromagnetic\nwavelength\n\nTSM \u00b7 Difficulty to define the limit between large and small scales\nIEM \u00b7 Computationally expensive\nSSA \u00b7 Slopes of the roughness small compared to the incidence and\n\nscattering angles\n\nAdapted from Cardellach, E., Rius, A., Martin-Neira, M., Fabra, F., Nogue?s-Correig, O., Ribo?, S.,\nKainulainen, J., Camps, A., D\u2019Addio, S., 2014.

If SNRD[1, then SNR/SNRcr, but this requires antennas\nwith very large directivities. Table 6.6 summarizes these values for the PARIS IoD instrument,\ndifferent bands, and signals. It can be noted that for moderate SNRD the SNR loss as compared to\nSNRcr is w2 dB, to be traded-off with the increase of b.\n\nHowever, the SNR is not only affected by thermal noise, but speckle noise can be dominant. A\nrough approximation that allows us to assess the effect of speckle noise is by adding it to the thermal\nnoise as:\n\nNSR0R=cr \u00bc NSRD=cr \u00fe NSRspeckle; (6.62)\nwhere NSRspeckle \u00bc 1=3:63 \u00f0 ? 5:6 dB\u00de, and it is independent of bandwidth. Finally, the SNR is\nimproved with incoherent averaging of Ni.\n\n6.4.3.2 Realistic Approach\nIn the previous section a coarse approximation to the effect of noise was presented. A more precise\nestimation of the delay is presented here using the Crame?r-Rao bound (CRB) including the covariance\n\nmatrix\n?\nC\n?\nof the data:\n\ns2s ?\n1P\n\nk;l\n\nC\n?1\nk;l s0\u00f0tk ? s\u00des0\u00f0tl ? s\u00de\n\n; (6.63)\n\nwhere s\u2019 is the waveform\u2019s derivative.

However, the amount of reduction depends on the\ncorrelation between the noise in the same lag s in consecutive observables Yc,i,r (tn,s,fd) and Y\n\nc,i,r\n\n(tn\u00fe1,s,fd) (slow time). The physical interpretation is presented in Fig. 6.24.\nThe analysis of the noise correlation between consecutive lags is performed using the covariance\n\nmatrices defined as:\n\nC\u00f0s1; s2\u00de \u00bc\n?\nYc;i;r\u00f0t; s1; fd \u00bc 0\u00de$Yc;i;r ?\u00f0t; s2; fd \u00bc 0\u00de\n\n?\n; (6.64)\n\nwhich can be understood as the sum of two terms: one corresponding to the signal, and the other one\ncorresponding to the noise. Fig. 6.25 illustrates this for a space-borne cGNSS-R instrument. The\ninterested reader can refer to a simulation study for the cGNSS-R case in (Garrison, 2012), a detailed\nanalytical study for the cGNSS-R case in Mart??n et al. (2014), and for the iGNSS-R case in Mart??n-\nNeira et al. (2011).\n\nAs can be observed from Fig. 6.25A and B, the noise component is present in all the delays, while\nclearly this is not the case for the signal term (since it is dependent on the backscattered signal). The\ncovariance noise term follows the shape of the ACF, and the covariance signal term is dependent on the\ncomplex multiplication of the ACF at delays s1 and s2. This analysis is fundamental to estimate the\nachievable SNR and the ultimate instrument performance, as well as to specify the instrument in an\noptimum way in terms of bandwidth (Pascual et al., 2014), sampling frequency, width, and central\n\nFIGURE 6.24\n\nPhysical interpretation of the noise correlation (A) between consecutive lags of the same waveform,\n\nand (B) between the same waveform lag in consecutive waveforms (You et al., 2004).\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 491\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.24|tif\n\n\nposition of the tracking window (Mart??n et al., 2015). In addition, the correlation between consecutive\nlags is also related to the achievable data compression that can be achieved, for example, using the\nwavelet transform (Camps et al., 2012a).\n\nConsecutive waveforms (cGNSS-R) are plotted versus the correlation lag (x-axis) for up to 1000\nsnapshots (Tc \u00bc 1 ms, Ni \u00bc 1000) in Fig. 6.26. As it can be seen, the amplitude fluctuations are quite\nstrong, and the correlation between the noise in the same lag s in consecutive observables (\u201cbin-to-bin\u201d\ncorrelation) limits the effectiveness of the incoherent averaging. The speed of these fluctuations depends\non two factors: (1) the properties of the surface under observation (i.e., how fast it changes, if it changes\nat all, for example, the ice, the land, or the variable ocean surface under different wind speeds), and\n\nFIGURE 6.25\n\n(A) Signal component covariance matrix (signal statistics) for cGNSS-R.

The coherent integration time is Tc \u00bc 1 ms, and the number of incoherent averages in-\ncreases from 1 up to 10,000. As can be seen, longer integration times are required to achieve a clear\nwaveform due to higher noise of the interferometric processing. The zoom shows that individual\nwaveforms are formed by the scattering on a few facets only (in particular the zoom shows one around\nthe specular reflection point), and how the impulse response to that facet is simply the ACF squared.\n\nIn Fig. 6.28A we present the standard deviation of each correlation lag as a function of the inco-\nherent integration time (as in Fig. 6.27). It can be appreciated that:\n\n\u2022 the standard deviation is higher where the waveform amplitude is higher (speckle noise or\n\u201cmultiplicative\u201d noise), and\n\n\u2022 the standard deviation does not decrease as the squared root of Ni, because the corresponding area\nof the lags associated with the higher peaks is smaller and contains fewer scatterers. Before\nthe leading edge, and in the tail, thermal noise dominates and the SNR goes as the squared root of\nNi (Fig. 6.28B). This effect can be interpreted as an \u201ceffective\u201d number of incoherent averages\nNi,eff that depends on the lag, and that unfortunately, is smaller where the waveform carries the\ninformation.

This\nis illustrated graphically in Fig. 6.29 with the only publicly available data from UK-DMC (Gleason\nand Gebre-Egziabher, 2009) over the ocean, for Tc \u00bc 1 ms, Ni from 10 to 800. Although the DDM\nstarts to be distinguishable above Ni \u00bc 100, the SNR is still quite poor, and much longer integration\ntimes are required.\n\nIt is worth to note that the properties of the speckle noise are, however, strongly dependent on the\ntarget. The situation shown in Fig. 6.29 is quite different over land and ice, shown in Fig. 6.30 for\nTc \u00bc 1 ms, Ni \u00bc 200, together with the ocean one for better intercomparison. As we can see, the\nDDM in the case of the ice corresponds very closely to the WAF, that is, the product of a triangle\nsquared in the delay domain, times a sin c function in the Doppler domain. This suggests that the\nreflection is nearly specular, despite the fact that the geometry is a bistatic one (not forward-scattering\nor near-grazing angle). Over land, the shape is not as clean as in the ice case, but a strong coherent\nreflection is still present, although with some blurring due to changing topography effects during the\nintegration time, and some Doppler spread is also visible.\n\nFinally, to illustrate the combined effects of type of target and observation geometry, Fig. 6.31\nshows the griPAU instrument measurements of the peak of the delay-Doppler map over: (1) the ocean\nfrom a 382 m height cliff (Valencia et al., 2010) and (2) a bare soil from w3 m height scaffolding\n\nFIGURE 6.27\n\nSample interferometric waveforms obtained with PIR-A instrument for Tc \u00bc 1 ms, and Ni \u00bc 1 (red), 10\n(purple), 100 (orange), 1.000 (green), and 10,000 (blue) waveforms.

In the first case, peak fluctuations are very fast due to the changes in the ocean\u2019s\nsurface, while in the second case the fluctuations are much slower and are only due to the movement of\nthe GPS satellites themselves. In both cases the estimated SNR isw6.5 dB, not too far from the expected\nSNR for pure speckle noise (5.6 dB). However, in the second case, much longer integration times will be\nrequired to reduce speckle noise, since it is strongly correlated from sample to sample.\n\nA last remark is that in the above analyses it is implicitly assumed that delay and Doppler tracking and\nretracking are properly performed, otherwise the DDMs and waveforms get blurred, the peak amplitude\n\nFIGURE 6.28\n\n(A) Standard deviation of each waveform lag as a function of the number of incoherent averages, (B) evolution\n\nof the signal-to-noise with the number of incoherent averages as a function of the correlation lag, and (C) ratio\n\nof the number of incoherent averages and the \u201ceffective number\u201d of incoherent averages.\n\nFrom Camps, A., Park, H., Valencia, E., Pascual, D., Martin, F., Rius, A., Ribo?, S., Benito, J., Andres-Beivide, A., Saameno, P.,\n\nStaton, G., Mart??n, M., d\u2019Addio, S., Willemsen, P., 2014.

For a detailed study of these effects, and how to\ncompensate them, the interested reader is directed to Park et al. (2012a,b, 2013, 2014a). The effect of\ntracking or nontracking in theDDMformation is illustrated in the nontracking case (https://www.youtube.\ncom/watch?v\u00bcflI6_bPxsEE) and tracking case (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u00bcgQJdsEBXoSo).\n\nFig. 6.32 (from Park et al., 2014a) illustrates these effects using the publicly available data from\nUK-DMC over the ocean.\n\n6.4.4 GNSS-R INSTRUMENTS\n6.4.4.1 Observables\nGNSS-R instruments can measure different observables:\n\n\u2022 The DDM is the most complete GNSS-R observable, and it is simply Eqs. (6.52) and (6.53) for a\nvariable number of delays and Doppler cuts around the cross-correlation peak. It contains all the\ninformation to derive, for example, wind speed and direction over the ocean.\n\n\u2022 The waveform (WF) is the cut of the DDM in the delay direction through the peak. This\nobservable contains the minimum information required to derive the altimetric information from\nthe peak of its derivative.\n\nFIGURE 6.31\n\nPeak of the delay-Doppler map over: (A) the ocean surface (Valencia et al., 2010); and (B) land (Valencia\n\net al., 2013b).\n\n498 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flI6_bPxsEE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flI6_bPxsEE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flI6_bPxsEE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJdsEBXoSo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJdsEBXoSo\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.31|tif\n\n\n\u2022 The waveform peak amplitude (WPA) is the maximum value of the WF. This observable contains\nthe minimum scattering information required, for example, to derive wind speed, soil moisture, or\nvegetation biomass. This observable can be either absolute or differential (relative amplitude\nbetween the peaks measured by an up-looking and a down-looking antenna). It can also be\nmeasured in reflection or in transmission.\n\n\u2022 The ratio of the WPAs at two polarizations, e.g., LHCP and RHCP. This observable contains the\nscattering information required, for example, to derive wind speed, although it depends on the\npolarization purity of the transmitted signals, and the cross-polar level of the receiving antennas.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that other techniques exist, such as the \u201cSNR Technique\u201d (Larson\net al., 2008a) and the \u201cInterference Pattern Technique\u201d (IPT) (Rodriguez-Alvarez et al., 2011) that\ninclude the measurement of the fading produced by the interference between the direct and reflected\nsignals. While the SNR Technique uses GNSS geodetic receivers with RHCP antennas pointing to the\nzenith, the IPT uses ad-hoc receivers with linear polarization antennas (vertical and horizontal)\npointing to the horizon so as to pick the direct and the reflected signals simultaneously. In the IPT, the\nangular position where the fading disappears, its peak-to-peak amplitude as a function of the elevation\nangle, and/or the relative phase between the interference patterns at vertical and horizontal polari-\nzations are measured. The constructive/destructive interference between the direct and the reflected\n\nFIGURE 6.32\n\nDelay tracking impact using UK-DMC data.

For a vertically polarized antenna, the fading disappears at the Brewster angle, which depends\non the dielectric constant, and the amplitude of the fading fluctuations depend on the magnitude of\nthe reflection coefficient, which depends on the dielectric constant as well. If the relative phase of the\nfading patterns at vertical and horizontal polarizations is observed, a 90? phase shift occurs at the\nBrewster angle, which is almost insensitive to roughness effects.\n\nThe instruments required to measure the first four observables are basically the same, except for\ntheir computing capabilities in terms of number of complex correlators, antenna types, and tracking\ncapabilities. They will be explained in the next section. The instruments required to measure the IPT\ncan be static standard GNSS receivers with the appropriate antennas and data loggers.\n\n6.4.4.2 Techniques\nIn Section 6.4.3 the most typical GNSS-R types were mentioned: the conventional GNSS-R (cGNSS-\nR), the (partial) interferometric GNSS-R [(p)iGNSS-R], and the reconstructed GNSS-R (rGNSS-R).\nThe diagrams in Figs. 6.33e6.36 present the block diagrams of these different instruments.\n\nFor scatterometric applications, the cGNSS-R approach is enough, since the peak of the waveform\ndoes not depend much on the bandwidth of the (public) signals (compare Fig. 6.37A and B). However,\nthe slope of the leading edge of the iGNSS-R waveform is much steeper than that of the cGNSS-R\nwaveform, which should lead to a higher range resolution (depending on the SNR).\n\nFIGURE 6.33\n\nBasic concept of a conventional GNSS-R instrument.\n\nFIGURE 6.34\n\nBasic concept of an interferometric GNSS-R instrument.\n\n500 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.33|tif\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.34|tif\n\n\nDown-converter\n\nDown-converter\n\nDown\n\nUp\n\nADC\n\nADC C/A\nCode\n\nL2 ACC\n\nL1 ACC\n\nP(Y) Code processing\n\nCorrelators\n\nC/A Code processing\n\nMaster\nCLK\n\nL1\n\nL2\n\nL1\n\nL1\n\nP1\n\nP2\nL2 L2\n\nM\nic\n\nro\npr\n\noc\nes\n\nso\nr\n\nS\num\n\nm\nat\n\nio\nn \n\nci\nrc\n\nui\nts\n\nW\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nP-code\nmodel\n\nDifferent lags\n\nW-chip\n\nEarly\nPrompt\n\nlate ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nC/A code\ngenerator\n\nCode and\ncarrier tracking\n\n(. ) WF\n\nFIGURE 6.35\n\nBasic approaches of the reconstructed GNSS-R technique.\n\nAdapted from Carren?o-Luengo, H., Camps, A., Ramos-Pe?rez, I., Rius, A., 2014.

Under the assumption of uncorrelated additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) the delay estimation error is given by the6 CRB:\n\ns2s ?\n1\n\nSNR$b2\n; (6.66)\n\nwhere SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, and b is the so-called rms bandwidth, defined as:\n\nb2 b\n\nRminfB;BISg\n0 f\n\n2jS\u00f0f\u00dej2dfRB\n0 jS\u00f0f\u00dej2df\n\n; (6.67)\n\nwhere B and BIS are the baseband bandwidths of the receiver\u2019s filter and the transmitted signal ac-\ncording to the IS documents (NAVSTAR IS-GPS-200, 2011; NAVSTAR IS-GPS-705, 2011; Galileo\nOS-SIS-ICD, 2010), and jS\u00f0f\u00dej2 is its spectrum.\n\nOne way to overcome the limitation of the bandwidth (BIS) of the public codes, is the so-called\ninterferometric GNSS-R processing (Martin-Neira, 1993), or \u201ciGNSS-R\u201d in short, in which the re-\nflected signal is cross-correlated with the direct signal itself sD(t) after proper Doppler frequency and\ndelay adjustment, as sketched in Fig. 6.34, and formulated in Eqs. 6.51b and 6.52.\n\nThe intercomparison between cGNSS-R and iGNSS-R is not straightforward since there are pros\nand cons for each method. In cGNSS-R the code replica is generated locally: it allows us to separate\ndifferent satellites by their codes, it inherently has a high (infinite7) SNR, and smaller size (directivity)\nantennas can be used to track the reflected signals. However, only the public codes can be used, which\nexhibit a limited bandwidth, and limited range resolution. Also, the delay and Doppler frequency\ndynamics are larger, and these values must be adjusted more frequently for proper operation. In\niGNSS-R there is no need to know the code, since the direct signal itself is used instead. It allows not\nonly to use GNSS signals, but satellite radio, satellite television, or any other sources of opportunity\nwith larger transmitted power, larger bandwidth, and better SNR, leading to potentially improved\nrange resolution. In addition, the differential processing produced in the cross-correlation leads to\nslower delay and Doppler frequency dynamics, which aredin principledeasier to track. The main\ndrawbacks are the large antenna size (directivity) required for the up-looking antenna, even when\nsatellite television signals are used, which leads to the use of beam steering techniques, and eventually\nmultibeam antennas if several reflection points are to be tracked, the need to separate different\n\n5The ultimate performance depends not only on b, but on the SNR as well, the noise correlation, the width of the tracking\nwindow etc., as discussed previously. However, the value of b computed from the waveforms shown in Fig. 6.37A is bz 4.\n8 MHz, a much smaller value than the receiver\u2019s and the signal\u2019s bandwidth, and it will ultimately limit the achievable altim-\netry resolution improvement by a factor of w4.8 MHz/2.2 MHz (rms bandwidth of WF signal with composite signal/band-\nwidth of C/A code) \u00bc 2.18 (Camps et al., 2012a,b, 2014). Similar results have been obtained by Rius et al. (2012), D\u2019Addio\nand Martin-Neira (2013) and Cardellach et al. (2014). The physical explanation of this result is the smoother shape of the\nwaveform resulting from the convolution of the ACF with the scatterers on the surface, as compared to the ACF itself. The\nbest altimetry performance could only be achieved for quasi-specular reflections, when the WF looks like the ACF.\n6For low SNRs (<5 dB) the Ziv-Zakai bound (Kay, 1993) provides a better indication of the magnitude of the estimation\nerrors, which can be actually much larger than the CRB ones.\n7Except for mismatches in the frequency responses of the transmitter filters that smooth the signals in a slightly different way\nfor each satellite.\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 503\n\n\n\nsatellites from their signature (\u201clocation\u201d) in the delay-Doppler map, and the higher susceptibility to\nradio frequency (RF) interference.\n\nTo overcome some limitations of the previous techniques, newer approaches have been developed,\nnamely the reconstructed GNSS-R (rGNSS-R) (Carren?o et al., 2012, 2014; Lowe et al., 2014) and the\npartial interferometric GNSS-R (piGNSS-R) (Li et al., 2014). The rGNSS-R is similar to the cGNSS-R\ntechnique, but semicodeless techniques are used to reconstruct the P(Y) code which is then correlated\nwith the reflected signal. The piGNSS-R is similar to the iGNSS-R technique, but the P and M codes\ncomponents of the direct signal are extracted from the reference signal (direct signal) by coherent\ndemodulation, and the interferometric approach is then applied to the reflected signal.\n\nIn Fig. 6.35A the correlation approach used in the downward-looking channel (slave: shown) in-\nstrument provides P-code processing of encrypted GPS signals without knowledge of the encrypted\ncode, in addition to the C/A code for cGNSS-R, while the upward-looking channels (master: not shown)\nuse a similar correlation approach and feed the information to the down-looking channel (slave) (Carren?o\net al., 2012, 2014). In Fig. 6.35B the direct L1-C/A signal is processed with typical DLLs and PLLs. The\nlocked C/A code model is used to form a L1P model, which is then applied to the direct signal (center\nleft), and after integration over w0.5 MHz W-chips to estimate their signs, it is combined with the P-\ncode model to form an L1 Y-code model that is used to correlate with the downward-looking chan-\nnel. The advantages of this technique rely mainly on the larger bandwidth of the P(Y) codes, as compared\nto the C/A ones, and the large SNR, despite the losses of the semicodeless approach.\n\nThe basic approach of the piGNSS-R technique is presented here in Fig 6.36. The advantages of\nthis technique are an even better range resolution as compared to the iGNSS-R one, but at the expense\nof a 3 dB signal loss (C/A code has been removed), which needs to be compensated by a 3 dB larger\nantenna directivity.\n\nRelative altimetry or scatterometry observations can also be performed by applying the cGNSS-R\ntechniques shown in Fig. 6.5 to the direct signal as well. This approach is intrinsically more insensitive\nto errors than absolute measurements performed with the basic scheme shown in Figs. 6.35 or 6.36.\nAlternatively, the second receiving chain can be replaced by mechanical or electrical beam steering to\nalternate between the direct and reflected signals. Table 6.7 summarizes the pros and cons of the\ndifferent GNSS-R approaches.\n\n6.4.4.3 Hardware Considerations\nGNSS-R instruments share many commonalities with standard navigation receivers. In the following\nsections the different subsystems will be reviewed and the main characteristics pointed out.\n\nAntennas pick up the GNSS signals and deliver them to the receiver. While most low-cost GNSS\nreceivers worry more about the antenna size, without paying much attention to the antenna pattern\nshape, polarization purity, and ohmic losses, and geodetic receivers worry more about multipath and\ninterference mitigation and phase center stability, GNSS-R antennas must be carefully designed and\ncharacterized to fulfill the instrument requirements. The following is a quick review of the main an-\ntenna parameters that have to be revised while defining a GNSS-R instrument.\n\n6.4.4.3.1 Operating Frequencies and Bandwidths\nPrecise GNSS-R instruments will make use of the full available bandwidth of GNSS signals, either\nusing the (p)iGNSS-R or the rGNSS-R techniques, anddfor altimetric applicationsdat least at two\nfrequency bands. On the other hand, most low-cost GNSS receivers only pick the reduced bandwidth\n\n504 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\n\n\ncodes at L1. Table 6.8 summarizes the frequencies and bandwidths of the signals used by different\nsystems. Designing a multiband large-bandwidth and well behaved is a challenge, especially is size\nand losses matter.\n\n6.4.4.3.2 Gain Pattern and Polarization\nAntennas for GNSS receivers must have an azimuthally symmetric antenna pattern at RHCP with a\nnull8 at 90? from boresight to mitigate interferences. For GNSS-R instruments the downward-looking\nantenna must be LHCP, and possibly RHCP as well for polarimetric instruments. In addition, while the\npolarization purity is not an issue in navigation receivers and an axial ratio above 3 dB is enough, for\nGNSS-R instruments the cross-polarization must be higher than w25e30 dB within the FOV (not\nnecessarily the full half-power beamwidth), because of the low level of the expected depolarization\neffects (Schiavulli et al., 2015).\n\n6.4.4.3.3 Multipath Mitigation and Interference Suppression\nMultipath and interference are mitigated by having a highly attenuated antenna pattern below the\ncutoff angle qC: choke rings, resistive loading, conducting ground plane, or metamaterials are placed at\nthe rim of high-performance GPS antennas. While these are not typical requirements for GNSS-R\nantennas, these techniques also improve the isolation between neighbor antennas, and therefore, the\nantenna pattern similarity both in amplitude and phase.\n\nTable 6.7 Advantages and Disadvantages of the Different GNSS-R Approaches\n\nGNSS-R Type Advantages Disadvantages\n\ncGNSS-R \u00b7 Code replica generated locally 0 high\nSNR, smaller antennas\n\n\u00b7 Transmitters separable by code\n\u00b7 Only public codes can be used\n\u00b7 Limited bandwidth 0 limited\n\nresolution\n\n\u00b7 Large dynamics of s and fd\niGNSS-R \u00b7 Any opportunity signal can be used (e.g., TV):\n\nlarger bandwidth and transmitted\npower 0 better SNR\n\n\u00b7 Full bandwidth can be used 0 improved\nresolution\n\n\u00b7 Differential processing reduces dynamics of s\nand fd\n\n\u00b7 Direct signal has poor\nSNR 0 larger up-looking\nantennas required\n\n\u00b7 Transmitters have to be separated\nby different s, fd in delay-Doppler\ndomain\n\npiGNSS-R \u00b7 Improved resolution as compared to iGNSS-R \u00b7 Poorer SNR than iGNSS-\nR 0 \u00fe3 dB larger directivity\nrequired\n\nrGNSS-R \u00b7 Large bandwidth code replica generated\nlocally using pseudo-correlation\ntechniques 0 high SNR (smaller than in\ncGNSS-R), smaller antennas\n\n\u00b7 Transmitters separable by code\n\n\u00b7 Large dynamics of s and fd\n\n8Actually it is not a null, but the pattern below a given \u201ccut-off angle\u201d (qc), typically w5?, must be \u201clow enough\u201d.\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 505\n\n\n\n6.4.4.3.4 Phase Center Stability\nThe stability of the phase center depending on the direction is an important requirement for positioning\narrays, and it is so for GNSS-R arrays whenever phase matters (e.g., phase altimetry). Tables 6.9 and\n6.10 summarize the typical antenna performance requirements depending on the application, and the\nbasic antenna types and their characteristics.\n\nLow noise amplifiers and front-ends. Since the received signals are very weak, the required\nperformances for the front-ends and low noise amplifiers (LNAs) are those of a microwave radiometer:\nvery low noise figure (NF z 1 dB), high gain (G ? 30 dB) to make the overall noise figure in-\ndependent on the following stages, and high IP3 to avoid nonlinearities that may cause out-of band\nsignals desensitize the receiver. A number of LNAs, or complete GPS receiver chips are available on\nthe market that can be used, including in-phase and quadrature outputs already sampled, such as the\nMAX2769B, the MAX2745, or the former ZARLINK GP2015/2010 front-end and the GP2021 12\nchannel correlator. This last family of chips was the one used in NASA\u2019s DMR (the first \u201cdelay\nmapping receiver\u201d GNSS-R receiver ever designed and built).\n\nTable 6.8 Signals and Constellations of Major GNSS Systems: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo,\nand Compass\n\nSystem Country Constellation Coding\nCarrier/Center\nFrequency (MHz)\n\nMaximum\nBandwidth\n(MHz)\n\nGPS IJSA 24 MEO (32\nsatellites in orbit in\n2011 and under\nmodernization)\n\nCDMA L1/L1C: 1575.420\nL2/L2C: 1227.600\nL5: 1176.45\n\n30.69\n\nGLONASS Russia 24 MEO (24\nsatellites in orbit in\n2011 and 6 active\nspares to be added)\n\nFDMA\nCDMA\nFDMA\nCDMA\nCDMA\nCDMA\n\nL1: 1602.000 \u00fe\nk \t 0.5625a\nLi: 1575.420\nL2: 1246.000 \u00fe\nk \t 0.4375a\nL2: 1242.000\nL3: 1202.025\nL5: 1176.450\n\n40.96\n\nGalileo European\nUnion\n\n27 MEO plus 3\nspares (2 in\noperation in 2011)\n\nCDMA El: 1575.420\nE6: 1278.750\nE5b: 1207.140\nE5: 1191.795\nE5a: 1176.450\n\n40.96\n\nCompass China 27 MEO plus 5\nGEO and 3 IGSO\n(4 MEO, 5 GEO, 5\nIGSO in, 2011)\n\nCDMA B1:\n1559.052e1591.788\nB2:\n1162.220e1217.370\nB3:\n1250.618e1286.423\n\n30.69\n\nak \u00bc 0 to 24; each satellite having an FDMA channel.\nFrom Wang, J.J.H., July 2012.

SAW filters are typically used because of their small size (a few squared\nmillimeters) and acceptable losses. Table 6.11 shows some commercial SAW filters, with sample GPS\nfilters for L1 and L2 bands, with bandwidths from 2 to 20 MHz, and insertion losses from 1.5 to 4 dB\n(at L1).\n\nHowever, if the power in adjacent bands is too strong, filters\u2019 rejection cannot be enough and may\ndesensitize the GNSS receiver. A dramatic example of this was the Lightsquared communications\nsystem that intended to combine satellite communications services with a ground-based 4G-LTE\nnetwork that would transmit on the same radio-band as its satellites (right next to L1).9 Fig. 6.38\npresents the spectra of the Lightsquared system, Inmarsat GPS, and Glonass, and their relative power\nlevels, as well as the filters\u2019 response of different GPS receivers, illustrating the interference that would\nbe created by these strong nearby signals.\n\nHowever, filters cannot eliminate harmonics from services at lower frequency bands, falling inside\nthe navigation bands (Table 6.12), self-interference from clocks and memories from the same GNSS-R\ninstrument (Fig. 6.39 from Querol et al., 2014), or deliberate emissions from jammers, which are\nbecoming more and more a problem because of the widespread of the so-called PPDs (Personal\nPrivacy Devices).

More recently,\nother counter-measurements, similar to those used in microwave radiometry are being undertaken (see\nSection 4.6.4.4), with the main difference that the signal cannot be \u201cblanked,\u201d otherwise the signal\ntracking is lost. An example of such an experimental system, named FENIX, was developed by Querol\nBorra?s and Camps Carmona (2017).\n\nDown-converters. The main approaches for the down-conversion are analog down-conversion to\nzero IF (fIF \u00bc 0) using I/Q demodulators, nonzero IF using a single mixer at a fIF ? BRF, and direct\nsampling using band-pass sampling, a digital technique consisting in picking the appropriate replica\ngenerated during the sampling. In the first case there are two channels to be sampled at, at least,\nfs ? BRF, while in the second one there is just one channel to be sampled at fS ? 2$BRF. In\npractice, more than one down-conversions are needed to properly reject the image frequencies.\n\nAutomatic Gain Control (AGC) compensates the fluctuations of the input power in order to\noptimize the dynamic margin of the Analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The combined response of\nthe AGC and ADC determine the capability to reject RFI, since it provides a natural immunity to\npulsed RFI. Although most GNSS navigation and GNSS-R receivers still use 1-bit sampling, advances\nin ADCs and digital processing allow nowadays to use a larger number of bits (e.g., 3 bits) that fa-\ncilitates the implementation of digital filtering, down-conversion, RFI detection/mitigation algorithms\netc. The increase in the number of bits also reduces the so-called quantization losses, a degradation of\nthe SNR created by the increased noise levels coming from the sampling aliases. Table 6.13 presents\nthe number of levels, N half the number of levels, ? the spacing between adjacent input levels, and the\nquantization losses (in linear units). It is clear that the quantization loss for 1 bit/2 levels\nis ?1.96 dB z ?2 dB, while for 3 bits/8 levels is just ?0.16 dB, which is almost negligible.\n\nThe Local Oscillator (LO) impacts the down-converters\u2019 performance, since an LO error trans-\nlates into phase and/or frequency errors (apparent Doppler frequency). For example, a 10 Hz error in a\n10 MHz reference clock leads to 1.5 kHz at 1.57542 GHz. LO errors are nonstationary and are\ncharacterized by the Allan\u2019s variance (or standard deviation) also known as two-sample variance is a\n\nTable 6.13 Number of Levels, N (Half the Number of Levels), ?

Originally most of the correlations were performed serially, because of\nthe few hardware resources required and easy implementation, but the performance was very slow. In\nopposition if all correlations could be performed in parallel, it will be very fast, but it will require many\nhardware resources, which will be used during a very low duty cycle. Finally, taking advantage of the\nfact that today\u2019s clocks run much faster than the navigation (GPS) signals, a semiparallel approach can\nbe implemented where the same correlator blocks in the chip are used to compute different delay-\nDoppler bins within the coherent integration time (typically) w1 ms.\n\n6.4.4.4 Past, Present, and Future of GNSS-R Instruments\nThe first GNSS-R instrument was the NASA delay mapping receiver (http://ccar.colorado.edu/dmr/\nreceiver/). It was developed by Garrison and Katzberg to study GPS surface reflections.

This \u201cdelay-Doppler-mapping receiver\u201d concept consists of\nan array of correlator pairs (Fig. 6.42) that accumulate the results of the correlation between a locally\ngenerated PRN code replica (at some defined delay and Doppler frequency) and the I/Q components of\na down-converted, digitized reflected signal. The postdetection power in each bin is computed from the\nsum of the squares of the I and Q components as I2 \u00fe Q2.\n\nThe receiver was implemented using a COTS GPS-development kit with the MITEL (Zarlink) GP\n2021 chip with 12-channel correlators spaced w0.5 ms (2 MHz sampling frequency), fed by two RF\nfront ends one connected to an RHCP zenith-looking antenna, and the other one to an LHCP nadir-\nlooking antenna, to produce waveforms of Tc \u00bc 1 ms, and Ni \u00bc 100. The DMR instrument\n(Fig. 6.43; left) and the LHCP nadir-looking antenna (Fig. 6.43; right) (Garrison and Katzberg, 1997)\nperformed the first ever GPS-R scatterometry measurements.\n\nThe NASA/JPL delay/Doppler-mapping software receiver systems (Lowe et al., 2002b) orig-\ninally consisted of a modified TurboRogue GPS receiver that computed 1 s position measurements\nfrom direct GPS signals in the RF input and stored the results in a flash card, with raw L1 pseudo-range\nand carrier-phase observables sampled at 20.456 MHz recorded onto an AIT tape with a Sony SIR-\n1000 for off-line processing (Fig. 6.44). This instrument provided the first ocean-altimetry measure-\nment made using reflected GPS signals, from a Cessna airplane flying off the coast of Santa Barbara,\nCalifornia, at 1.5 km height and w50 m/s (Fig 6.45).\n\nAn upgrade of the single channel instrument shown before was developed later, which included\nfour TurboRogue front-ends modified for synchronous operation, 16 channel in-flight data recording\nsystem, and L1 I/Q and L2 I/Q signals from all four front-ends recorded with two Cybernetics\n\nRF\nfront-end\n\nRF\nfront-end\n\nCode\ntracking loop\n\nTime and or\nposition solution\n\nCode phase and\ncarrier frequency\n\n+1 chip\nin phase\n\n+1 chip in\nquadrature\n\n+N chips\nin phase\n\n+N chips in\nquadrature\n\nAccumulator\nSquare-law\ndetection\n\nIncoherent\naverage\n\nWaveform\n\nSpecular\npoint delay\n\nPFN\ngenerators\n\nLHCP radir\n\nRHCPzenith\n\nCorrelators\n\n?

It included a common LO generation system at 20.46 MHz, and\nan original (not commercial) data acquisition system that stored the data at 20 MB/s up to 1 h directly\ninto a commercial IDE/ATA-100 hard disk drive. The channels could be connected in any arbitrary\nconfiguration, for example, an RHCP up-looking antennas, and a pair of RHCP and LHCP down-\nlooking antennas (Nogue?s et al., 2003).

It included the SSTL SGR-10 GPS receiver (http://www.sstl.co.uk/\nProducts/Subsystems/Navigation/SGR-10-Space-GPS-Receiver), a dual antenna L1 C/A code GPS\nreceiver that weights about 1 kg and consumes 5.5 W. It was connected to a 12 dBi LHCP downward-\nlooking antenna (Fig. 6.49) and a recorder of the IF sampled outputs, which stored bursts of 20 s of\nraw data.\n\nSince 2003 IEEC has developed the GOLD-RTR (GPS Open Loop Differential Real-Time\nReceiver) instrument. It contains three receiving chains, driven by the same LO at 300 kHz below\nthe L1 central frequency. Real time correlators were implemented in Altera Stratix FPGA to produce\n64 lag complex waveforms at 20 MS/s, which provided a temporal spacing of 50 ns. The system clock\nat 40 MHz was also used to generate the LO and the FPGA clock, while a 1 pps (pulse per second)\nsignal was generated by a Novatel Navigation receiver.

The instrument also uses GPS signals reflected from land or ocean to determine properties of\nthose surfaces (soil moisture and surface roughness, respectively). Occultation samples represent\ndistances of ca. 300 km and so are complementary to the single-point measurements obtained by\nconventional soundings. It is a passive remote sensing system that records the full bandwidth (inter-\nmediate frequency) of the GPS signals and stores the measurements on hard disks for subsequent\nanalyses. The instrument started to be developed in 2006 (https://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/gnss-\ninstrument-system-multi-static-and-occultation-sensing).\n\nThe griPAU (GNSS-R instrument for PAU) was developed by UPC (Marchan-Hernandez et al.,\n2007; Valencia et al., 2010) as a precursor of the PAU space-borne instrument (Camps et al., 2011b;\nAlsonso et al., 2012), a secondary payload of INTA Microsat-1. The griPAU instrument is shown in\nFig. 6.51A and its block diagram in Fig. 6.51B. As most GNSS-R instruments, it had two receiving\nchains connected to an RHCP up-looking antenna and an LHCP down-looking antenna mounted on an\nantenna positioner. Its main feature was that, thanks to the implementation of hardware reuse tech-\nniques, this instrument was able to include a VHDL module in a Virtex-4 FPGA to compute in\nhardware, and in real time, the complete DDM, not by slices, as a sequence of waveforms. The DDM\n\nFIGURE 6.51\n\n(A) Picture and (B) block diagram of the griPAU instrument.\n\nFrom Valencia, E., Camps, A., Marchan-Hernandez, J.F., Bosch-Lluis, X., Rodriquez-Alvarez, N., Ramos-Perez, I., 2010.

It also\ncompensated automatically and dynamically the Doppler frequency shift and the delay (1 estimation\nevery 5 ms). Sample Delay-Dopler measurements and phase of the peak of the complex waveform are\nshown in Fig. 6.52.\n\nThe flight model of the PAU instrument is shown here in Fig. 6.53. PAU is a hybrid total power\nradiometer (with Kurtosis RFI detector) and GNSS-R receiver (Camps et al., 2007). It features two\ncold redundant receivers and processing boards based on Virtex-4 FPGAs with in-orbit reconfiguration\ncapability. DDMs\u2019 size is 4096 samples in delay times, 16 samples in Doppler and are computed in\nnear real time (1 s of data acquisition and w1 s of data processing).\n\nThe IEEC PIR and PIR-A (PARIS Interferometric ReceivereAirborne) was developed in\n2010 by the IEEC (Nogues-Correig et al., 2010). It implemented the iGNSS-R technique to validate\nthe concept of the PARIS IoD concept (Martin-Neira et al., 2011). A picture of the Zeeland Brugg\nexperiment carried out in July 2010 is presented here in Fig. 6.54A. The up- and down-looking an-\ntennas are clearly visible (directivity 15 dB, gain 9 dB, side lobes < ?35 dB). Two RF channels with\na bandwidth of 24 MHz each, are sampled at 80 MHz, and processed in real time to produce 320 lags\ninterferometric waveforms. The block diagram is shown in Fig. 6.54B.\n\nThe SSTL SGR-ReSI is the GNSS-R payload on board the UK satellite TechDemoSat launched on\nJuly 8, 2014. SGR-ReSi is based on COTS RF front-ends and LNAs. The L1 front-end is based on the\nMAX2769 reconfigurable GNSS front-end, and the L2c front-end on the reprogrammable satellite\ntuner MAX2112, plus an A/D converter. It can also be programmed to E6, L5, and E5ab bands. The\nLNA is the MAX2659, and an appropriate RF matching circuitry is used to suit both L1 and L2C\nbands. The antenna is a 2 \t 2 patch array, as seen in Fig. 6.55.\n\nThe 3Cat-2 mission (Carreno-Luengo et al., 2016) is a Spanish mission developed by UPC-\nBarcelona Tech based on a 6 unit (3 \t 2) CubeSat structure.

This mission is the first full mission award in NASA\u2019s low-cost venture-class\nEarth science program. It consists of a constellation of eight small satellites in LEO at 35? inclina-\ntion and each of them carries on board a modified version of the SSTL SGR-ReSI DMR to perform up\nto four simultaneous scatterometric observations of GPS L1 signals using the C/A code to infer wind\nspeed maps (Fig. 6.57). This point will be discussed in more detail in the ocean applications section.\nFig. 6.58A shows an artist view of a CYGNSS satellite and its parts are shown here in Fig. 6.58B. The\ngreen rectangles are two 3 \t 2 patch array with w14 dB gain (CYGNSS Handbook, 2016).\n\nFinally, in the 2019 time frame the ESAGEROS ISS experiment (GNSS REflectometry, Radio\nOccultation and Scatterometry onboard the International Space Station) (Wickert et al., 2016)\nshould be installed in the Columbus module of the International Space Station (Fig. 6.59). This\nexperiment is an answer to ESA call in 2011 to perform \u201cClimate change related research aboard ISS\u201d.\nGEROS-ISS goals are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Primary: To measure and map altimetric sea surface height of the ocean using reflected GNSS\nsignals to allow methodology demonstration, establishment of error budget and resolutions and\ncomparison/synergy with results of satellite-based nadir pointing altimeters. This includes POD\nof the GEROS payload.\n\n\u2022 Secondary: To retrieve scalar ocean surface mean square slope (MSS), which is related to sea\nroughness, wind speed, with a GNSS space-borne receiver to allow methodology testing,\nestablishment of error budget, and resolutions. In addition, it would be desirable to obtain 2D\nMSS (directional MSS, related to wind direction).\n\nFIGURE 6.55\n\nPicture of UK TechDemoSat with the 2 \t 2 patch array of spiral antennas (http://www.sstl.co.uk/Missions/\nTechDemoSat-1\u2013Launched-2014/TechDemoSat-1/TechDemoSat-1\u2013The-Mission).\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 523\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.55|tif\nhttp://www.sstl.co.uk/Missions/TechDemoSat-1--Launched-2014/TechDemoSat-1/TechDemoSat-1--The-Mission\nhttp://www.sstl.co.uk/Missions/TechDemoSat-1--Launched-2014/TechDemoSat-1/TechDemoSat-1--The-Mission\n\n\n\u2022 Additional: To assess the potential of GNSS scatterometry for land applications and in particular\nto develop products such as soil moisture, vegetation biomass, and mid-latitudes snow/ice\nproperties and to further explore the potential of GNSS RO data (vertical profiles of atmospheric\nbending angle, refractivity, temperature, pressure, humidity, and electron density), particularly\nin the Tropics, to detect changes in atmospheric temperature and climate relevant parameters\n(e.g., tropopause height) and to provide additional information for the analysis of the\nreflectometry data from GEROS (several new aspects: precipitation, low inclination, Multi-\nGNSS).\n\nFIGURE 6.56\n\nPicture of (A) zenith side of 3Cat-2, (B) nadir-looking antenna, and (C) satellite assembly.\n\nCourtesy of the Universitat Polite?cnica de Catalunya, NanoSat Lab.\n\n524 CHAPTER 6 REMOTE SENSING USING GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.56|tif\n\n\nAt the time of finishing this book the GEROS ISS payload has been proposed as the G-TERNS\nEarth Explorer 9 mission. The final selection by ESA will be made in June 2017.\n\nTable 6.14 summarizes of some existing GNSS-R instruments and their main parameters.\n\n6.4.5 APPLICATIONS\nGNSS-R applications extract the information from any of the observables explained in Section 6.4.4.1,\nnamely: the DDM, the WF, the WPA, the ratio of the WPAs at two polarizations, e.g., LHCP and\nRHCP, or the IPT. In what follows, the geophysical information will be extracted from one or another\nGNSS-R observable, although in some cases, the techniques could not be applied to an LEO satellite.\nIn the coming sections the following applications are presented: Ocean (wind speed mapping, s0 and\naltimetry applications), ice and dry snow monitoring, and land (soil moisture and vegetation biomass/\nwater content).\n\n6.4.5.1 Ocean Winds\nOcean wind retrieval was the first application of GNSS-R, and it was demonstrated with NASA\u2019s DMR\ninstrument. A few techniques have been developed to infer wind speed (and eventually direction) from\nGNSS-R observables.\n\n6.4.5.1.1 Parameter Estimation\nParameter Estimation is based on finding the best fit of a model to the measured waveform jY\u00f0s; fD\u00dej2.\nRecalling from Eqs. (6.53) and (6.56) that the wind speed information lies in s0 and that this parameter\ndepends on the slopes pdf, a simple expression of the slopes pdf must be used in the inversion, for\nexample, the up/cross-wind variances, or the wind speed dependence as in the Cox and Munk model,\nproperly scaled at L-band.\n\nFIGURE 6.57\n\nCYGNSS signal retrieval: Geometry of observation of the CYGNSS satellites.

An alternative approach consists of the identification of features in\nthe waveform or the DDM that can be related to the geophysical parameter.\n\nSimple observables of the waveform are the position and amplitude of the peak used to perform\nscatterometric measurements, the position of the maximum derivative point with respect to the peak\n(rscatt), the value of the maximum derivate of the waveform, or the length of the tail (stail) (see\nFig. 6.61).\n\nWhen the sea surface roughness increases, the DDM spreads in the delay and Doppler domains.\nHowever, the enlargement of the boomerang shape of the DDM (Figs. 6.29 and 6.30-top) is not\nnecessarily symmetric, since it depends on the relative velocities of transmitter and receiver and the\nwind direction. If the volume under the normalized DDM (peak amplitude equal to one) is computed\nfor the delay-Doppler bins that are above a given threshold, larger than the noise level (jYthj2):\n\nVDDM \u00bc\nZZ\n\njY\u00f0s;fD\u00dej2?jYthj2\njY\u00f0s; fD\u00dej2ds$dfD; (6.75)\n\nthis observable can be linked to the sea state. This is the approach proposed in the PAU instrument\n(Camps, 2003) to perform the sea state correction of L-band radiometric measurements, to improve the\naccuracy of the sea surface salinity retrievals. If the whole DDM is not available, the area under the\nnormalized waveform, above a given threshold can be used instead,\n\nAWF \u00bc\nZ\njY\u00f0s;fD;max\u00dej2?jYthj2\n\n??Y?s; fD;max???2ds.

(6.76) was tested in Valencia et al. (2011b) with waveforms acquired using the IEEC\nGOLD-RTR instrument. Fig. 6.62 shows the flight tracks from inner water body of fresh water to the\nBaltic sea. Fig. 6.63 shows the changes in the first Stokes parameter associated to changes in the sea\nsurface salinity and temperature, and the sea state (rougher in the open Baltic sea), the changes in the\narea of the normalized waveforms and their relative scatter plot.

(2013) these methods were analyzed using airborne data and it was\nfound that, after selecting the most suitable coherent integration time (Tc \u00bc 1 ms) and the threshold?\n10$log10\n\n?\ne?1\n??\n, the error of wind retrievals based on each observable was a minimum for the\n\nretrieval based on the taxicab distance from the center of the mass to the maximum position, whose\nmean error (bias) and standard deviation were the lowest: 0.76 and 0.79 m/s, respectively. However, as\nthe authors acknowledge, this result is for a particular experiment carried out in the NOAA\nGulfstream-IV jet aircraft on January 24, 2010, and that for a space-borne one the spatial resolution\nwould be unacceptably large.\n\nUsing the same data set from NOAA (January 24, 2010) in Valencia et al. (2014) the DDM\nasymmetry (skewness) was used to infer the wind direction (i.e., receiver flying direction and wind\ndirection). To measure the DDM skewness, the skewness angle\n\n?\nf1; skew\n\n?\n, was properly defined to\n\nmaintain sensitivity to wind direction and receiver flying direction, but otherwise to remain insen-\nsitive to the parameters that cause the DDM spreading (Fig. 6.65). For a single DDM measurement,\nthere are four possible solutions due to the double ambiguity of the problem, although one of the\nsolutions was always close to the ground-truth wind direction. To solve for one of the two\n\nFIGURE 6.65\n\n(A) Definition of the DDM skirt center of mass CMskirt and skewness angle f0, skew and (B) new definition of\n\nthe skewness angle f1, skew.\n\nFrom Valencia, E., Zavorotny, V.U., Akos, D.M., Camps, A., 2014.

While group\ndelay provides (coarse) absolute range measurements, phase delays provide precise, although not\naccurate, differential range measurements. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 6.30, GNSS-R from Earth\nsurfaces tends to be noncoherent (except for ice anddmaybedfor some land smooth surfaces), so\nonly group delay between the transmission and reception is usually feasible.\n\n6.4.5.2.1 Phase Altimetry\nPhase altimetry is estimated from the phase of the complex waveform (I and Q components). If the\nGNSS-R receiver includes a phase-locked loop, then phase variations are dynamically compen-\nsated, and the delay can be readily estimated from the pseudo-ranges and a model of the scattering\ngeometry. If the GNSS-R receiver is an open-loop, then the LO phase appears at the phases of the\noutput waveforms (direct and reflected fields, Fig. 6.70A), and needs to be stopped (Fig. 6.70B):\n\n4\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc arg?Er$E?d?; (6.87)\nbefore the phase unwrapping (Fig. 6.70C).\n\nIn delay altimetry, the observable (ri) is the delay between transmission and reception at a given\nfrequency band (fi). The delay associated to the geometry (rgeo), that is the altimetry observable, is\ngiven by:\n\nrgeo \u00bc\n??R!spec ? R!T??\u00fe ??R!R ? R!spec??; (6.88)\n\nwhere R\n!\n\nT, R\n!\n\nspec, and R\n!\n\nR are the vectors indicating the position of the transmitter, specular reflection\npoint, and receiver, respectively. However, in addition to rgeo, there are other error contributions such as:\n\n\u2022 the ionosphere (riono,i), whichdat L-banddcan introduce error delays of up to w40 m,\n\u2022 the troposphere (rtropo), largely driven by the \u201cdry component\u201d (about 2.3 m), and the \u201cwet\n\ncomponent\u201d, smaller, but more variable geographically,\n\u2022 the electromagnetic bias (rEM bias) that is due to the asymmetry of the surface waves, which\n\nscatter the electromagnetic radiation differently. It is a small, although not negligible\ncontribution, on the order of 1% of the significant wave height, and\n\n\u2022 other errors induced by multipath (?multipath), instrumental errors (?instr), or noise errors (?n).\n\nri \u00bc rgeo \u00fe riono;i \u00fe rtropo \u00fe rEMbias \u00fe ?multipath \u00fe ?instr \u00fe ?n.

(6.69), from the slope of the geometric term corrected by antenna offsets (e.g., Eq.\n(6.91) for a \u201cflat Earth\u201d10):\n\nH \u00bc 1\n2\n$\n\nvrgeo\nv\u00f0sin\u00f0qe\u00de\u00de ; (6.91)\n\nor from the maximum peak of the derivative of the waveform as illustrated in Fig. 6.82, an approach\noriginally proposed by Hajj and Zuffada (2003), and demonstrated later by Rius et al.

In a typical LEO, however, there is a residual part of the\nionosphere above the satellite and the ionospheric delay suffered by the direct and the scattered\nsignals are different, and different from the model predictions that account for the whole\nionosphere.\nIonospheric correction requires at least two pseudo-range observations r1 and r2 at two\nsufficiently spaced frequencies11 f1 and f2:\n\nr1 \u00bc ?2$h$sinqe \u00fe\nI0\n\nf21\n; (6.92)\n\nr1 \u00bc ?2$h$sinqe \u00fe\nI0\n\nf22\n; (6.93)\n\nFIGURE 6.71\n\nThe altimetry delay in a bistatic altimeter can be obtained from the delay from the direct signal to the\n\nmaximum peak of the derivative of the reflected waveform.\n\nAdapted from Carreno-Luengo, H., Park, H., Camps, A., Fabra, F., Rius, A., 2013.

The \u201cdry component\u201d (HZD) is larger that the \u201cwet component\u201d (WZD), and it can be\naccurately computed from atmospheric pressure data at the receiver site/level, while WZD is not.\nThe direct and the reflected signals in ground-based GNSS-R instruments are affected in similar\nways by tropospheric effects. In airborne instruments, these effects depend on the flight height,\nand in an LEO instrument only the reflected signal is affected. Since none of the planned space-\nborne GNSS-R instruments has a multifrequency radiometer (23.8 and 36.5 GHz, as a minimum)\nto infer the \u201cwet delay,\u201d corrections we should rely on proper modeling.\n\n\u2022 EM bias\nThe EM bias is the correction for the measurement bias introduced by varying reflectivity of wave\ncrests and troughs. It is defined as the normalized correlation between the RCS and the sea surface\nelevation (Elfouhaily et al., 1999):\n\nrEMbias \u00bc\n?\nx$s0\n\n?\nhs0i . (6.96)\n\nFew studies have been performed on the EM bias at L-band and in a bistatic configuration (Picardi\net al., 1998; Ghavidel et al., 2016). The predicted EM bias has been computed numerically using\nthe fundamental equation as a function of the wind speed and incidence angle for wind direction\n?wind \u00bc 45? (Fig. 6.72A), and azimuth angle (Fig. 6.72B).\nAs we learn from Fig. 6.72, EM bias is an important error source in GNSS-R altimetry that will need\nto be corrected for, taking into account the observation geometry and the wind speed conditions.\n\n\u2022 Multipath\nMultipath and direct signal cross-talk can easily arise in ground-based, experiments, and even in\nairborne ones. Since these signals are more coherent than the scattered ones, the coherent\ncomponent of the signal can be estimated and subtracted as (Mart??n et al., 2015):\n\nVar\u00f0Y\u00f0s\u00de\u00de \u00bc 1\nN\n\nXN\nj\u00bc1\n\n??Y?to;j; s???2 ?\n??????1N\nXN\nj\u00bc1\n\nY\n?\nto;j; s\n\n???????\n2\n\n.

(1998). The experimental\nset-up to measure the fading over a grass field using a GPS receiver is depicted in Fig 6.75A. By\nmatching the experimental results to the simulated ones (Fig. 6.75B), ground electrical characteristics\ncan be derived (roughness, dielectric constant etc.).\n\nLater, Larson et al. (2008a) showed that the multipath present in the GPS signals collected by the\nnetwork of geodetic receivers, induced a modulation of the received power that could be correlated to\nthe soil moisture through the dielectric constant. Although the antennas of geodetic GPS receivers are\nspecifically designed and manufactured to mitigate the antenna pattern back lobes, they are not zero,\nand some residual reflected signal is picked up by the receiver (Fig. 6.76A). Fig. 6.76B (top) shows a\nsample of L2 SNR data for satellite PRN 9 with a low frequency modulation due to the antenna pattern,\nand a high frequency modulation due to multipath. SNR data for a satellite with direct signal\ncontribution is removed using a low-order polynomial fit (Fig. 6.76B bottom), showing the high\nfrequency fluctuations associated with the multipath. Finally, the comparison of GPS multipath am-\nplitudes, the volumetric water content for two satellites (PRN 1 open circles, PRN 9 filled circles), and\nthe daily precipitation values as measured by a nearby airport are presented here in Fig. 6.76C.\n\nFIGURE 6.74\n\nEvolution of the ellipsoidal height along the flight.

To solve this, and to increase the\namplitude of the reflected signals, and thus the amplitude of the oscillations and the sensitivity, the\ntechnique was optimized and named the Interference Pattern Technique or IPT, for short. A dedicated\ninstrument12 was designed and manufactured to validate this technique. It consisted of a commercial\nGPS receiver (tuned) connected to a vertical polarization antenna with the maximum of its radiation\npattern pointing to the horizon and with very good azimuthal revolution symmetry (Rodriguez-Alvarez\net al., 2009). Under these conditions, the received power can be approximated as:\n\nPRfjEi \u00fe Erj2 \u00bc Fn\u00f0q;4\u00de$jE0ij2$\n???1\u00fe jGq\u00f0q; ?r\u00dej$e j\u00f0Db\u00febRq\u00f0q;?r\u00de\u00de???2; (6.98)\n\nwhere Ei and Er are the incident and reflected electric fields, jE0ij is the amplitude of the electric field,\nFn(q,4) is the antenna pattern with symmetry of rotation, jGq(q,?r)j is the reflection coefficient, q\nsatellite elevation angle, ?r is the soil dielectric constant, q is the polarization (q \u00bc v), Db \u00bc 4p/lh\nsinq is the different phase shift between the direct and reflected signals, bRq(q,?r) is the reflection\ncoefficient phase, h is the antenna phase center height, and l is the electromagnetic wavelength at the\nfrequency of operation (i.e., 19 cm for GPS L1).\n\nFIGURE 6.75\n\n(A) Experimental set-up, and (B) modeled and measured signal variations received on a dry grass field.\n\nReproduced by permission of the Institution of Engineering & Technology, Kavak, A., Vogel, W.J., Xu, G.

A nice feature of this technique is that the amplitude fluctuations disappear when the\nreflected signal vanishes, and that happens at the Brewster angle, since Gv(qBrewster) \u00bc 0. This\nobservable is a very precise one of the dielectric constant, which can be related afterward to the\nsoil moisture. In addition, away from the Brewster angle, the amplitude of the oscillations depends\non the magnitude of the reflection coefficient Gv(q) itself, which can be used to create soil moisture\nmaps along the strips on the ground defined by the position of the reflection point.13\n\nHowever, all GNSS-R observables, either based on the amplitude of the reflected signals, or on the\ninterference pattern generated by multipath, are also affected by the presence of vegetation and surface\nroughness. In Alonso-Arroyo et al. (2014a,b) an improvement of the IPTwas proposed that makes use\nof the differential phase shift between the interference patterns at vertical and horizontal polarizations\n\nFIGURE 6.76\n\n(A) Geometry of the observation of a geodetic antenna pattern, (B) amplitude of the collected GPS signal\n\nwithout and with antenna pattern removal, (C) retrieved soil moisture values for two different GPS satellites.\n\nLarson, K.M., Small, E.E., Gutmann, E., Bilich, A., Axelrad, P., Braun, J., 2008a.

GPS Solutions 12, 173e177.\n\n13Actually, despite the coherent behavior shown by the interference patterns (e.g., Fig. 6.77B), the reflection is\nnot completely specular and the \u201creflected\u201d (scattered) signal, as in the case of the ocean, comes from an area around the\nspecular reflection point determined by the intersection of the first Fresnel zone with the surface.\n\n6.4 GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM-REFLECTROMETRY 547\n\nmailto:Image of Figure 6.76|tif\n\n\nto better locate the position of the Brewster angle and therefore improve the soil moisture retrievals.\nFig. 6.78A shows a sample of these interference patterns and their relative phases. As it can be seen,\nthe presence of even low vegetation (grass) and surface roughness prevents a precise location of the\nBrewster angle in the vertical polarization interference pattern (red plot). However, for low elevation\nangles, the phase of the reflection coefficients at vertical and horizontal polarizations is the same\n(\u00a3Gv \u00bc \u00a3Gh) and both patterns are in phase (peaks and valleys go together), but as the elevation\nangle increases, the phase of the reflection coefficient at vertical polarization changes by 180? (peaks\nand valleys are in opposite phase). The optimum estimation of the Brewster angle occurs when the\ndifference is exactly 90?. The evolution of the estimated soil moisture values using both techniques,\nand the ground truth as measured by the two closest stations during a field experiment conducted from\nJuly 16e31, 2013, at Yanco, New South Wales, Australia is depicted here in Fig. 6.78B.\n\nThe IPT (or any multipath technique) has two main limitations:\n\n\u2022 The observables require the movement of the navigation satellite over a large fraction of its orbit\nto produce the \u201cinterference pattern\u201d, and it may take a few hours. Therefore, it is clear that this\ntechnique cannot be used in moving platforms (even ground based).\n\n\u2022 To observe the fringes of the pattern, both the direct and the reflected signals must arrive \u201cin\nphase\u201d, which means well within the same chip. In practice, this limits the receiver height to much\nless than half a chip, i.e., 150 m at GPS L1 using the C/A code. Using higher chipping rates codes\nonly limits even more the maximum receiver height.\n\nHowever, it has also the advantage of being able to produce maps of the local soil moisture dis-\ntribution, as illustrated in Fig. 6.79.\n\n(A) (B)\n\nSMIGOL\nReflectometer\n\nGPS Satellite\n\n?inc\n\n?inc\n\nrdirect\n\nrreflected\n\nrdirect\nAir {?0}\n\nLayer 1{?r1, t1}\n\nLayer 2{ ?r2,\n\nh\n\n2\n10 15 20 25\n\nElevation angle(\u00b0)\n\nGPS satellite 26\n\nAmplitude of\nfluctuations\n\nalso depends on SM\n\nBrewster angle (SM)\n\n30\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nR\nec\n\nei\nve\n\nd \npo\n\nw\ner\n\n (d\nB\n\n)\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\nMeasured\nTheoretical\n\n t2}\n\nFIGURE 6.77\n\n(A) Experiment set-up of the instrument applying the interference pattern technique, (B) sample interference\n\npattern showing a null corresponding to the position of the Brewster angle.\n\nAdapted from Rodriguez-Alvarez, N., Bosch-Lluis, X., Camps, A., Vall-llossera, M., Valencia, E., Marchan-Hernandez, J.F.,\n\nRamos-Perez, I., November 2009.

The ground track\nof specular reflections on a flight collected during flights over Northern Colorado are in Fig. 6.80A and\n6.80B shows the GPS scattered SNR versus volumetric in situ soil measurements for 31 field sites\ncontaining soybean and corn crops. As we can easily see, reflectivity correlates fairly well with soil\nmoisture.\n\nIn 2009, the griPAU instrument (Fig. 6.51) was mounted in a w3 m height scaffolding in the\nRemedhus test site in Zamora (Spain) to measure the complete DDM. Due to low height, instantaneous\nDDMs actually looked like the ideal WAFs. The most important results were as follows: the confir-\nmation that the scattering over land has a strong coherent component and the information is mostly in\nthe peak of the DDM itself, which correlates well with the soil moisture (Fig. 6.81A), and that the peak\namplitude fluctuations were a lot larger than over the ocean, and had a lower temporal scale, which\ndifficult the averaging (Fig. 6.81B).\n\nFig. 6.82 shows some airborne results obtained with the LARGO instrument (Alonso-Arroyo et al.,\n2014b) during the GELOz campaigns, Yanco Region, NSW, Australia (September and October 2013).\nThe LARGO footprint, as computed from the size of the first Fresnel zone, ranged from 15 to 60 m,\ndepending on flight height and incidence angle. On the left column, LARGO reflectivity measurements\nare plotted in a particular color scale to illustrate that the lower reflectivity (red) corresponds to the\ndrier soils, and the higher reflectivity corresponds to the wetter ones (green). The reflectivity over the\nocean or inland water bodies is even higher, as expected from the higher dielectric constant. As can be\nseen, in some cases up to four different GNSS reflections are being tracked simultaneously.

As can be seen, the correlation between the GNSS-R and the radiometric\nmeasurements is very strong, confirming that both observables respond to the same geophysical\nparameters.\n\nFinally, Fig. 6.83 (from Camps et al., 2016) shows some space borne results from the GNSS-R\nexperiment onboard the UK TechDemoSat-1 mission over the north east of Spain to illustrate the\nreflectivity changes (blue: high reflectivity, red: low reflectivity) over land with different soil moisture\nconditions as illustrated in the boxes with the in situ data, or due to the proximity of a large water body\n(Fig. 6.83 top right) or to the Ebro river (green dot on the left of Fig 6.83 left), or due to the sea state\nfrom very calm water (Fig. 6.83 bottom right), to rougher (windier) conditions.

The technique is actually very simple and consists of\nmeasuring the attenuation of the GNSS signal, as it passes through the vegetation canopy. The\nattenuation can be related to the VWC using the well-know formula for L-band microwave radiometry:\n\nL \u00bc e?s$sec\u00f0qi\u00de; (6.99a)\ns \u00bc b$VWC; (6.99b)\n\nwhere b is a vegetation-dependent factor. In the experiment shown in Rodriguez-Alvarez et al. (2012)\nover walnut trees, the value of b was found to depend between 0.82 and 0.88, in the elevation angle\nrange (55?e70?), since the leaves in this range of elevation angles are not homogeneous, and the\nhighest correlation was computed for 60? (Rodriguez-Alvarez et al., 2012). Note that the attenuation\n(Eq. 6.99a) in a GNSS-R scenario has to be squared since the signal attenuates in the down-welling\npath and in the up-welling path after the reflection takes place.\n\n6.4.5.4.2 Techniques based on \u201cscatterometry\u201d\nEgido (2013) performed a comprehensive study including theoretical and experimental measurements\nof the polarimetric scatterometry measuring G0RL and G\n\n0\nRR over different fields and forest.

The carrier phase of the reflected signals can also be\ntracked, and therefore centimetric altimetry solutions can be obtained. A number of applications have\nbeen developed, including the estimation of ice thickness.\n\n6.4.5.5.1 Sea Ice Thickness\nSea ice thickness can be inferred from the altimetry solution, once the oscillations due to tides are\nremoved. In Fig. 6.88A and B (from Fabra et al., 2012) we show the main results of an\nexperiment performed by IEEC/CSIC. The GOLD-RTR instrument was installed on a tower above a\n700-m cliff at Disko Bay, Greenland, from October 2008 to May 2009 (Arctic winter) to cover sea ice\nformation, its evolution, and melting. Due to experimental site constraints, the observation angles were\nrestricted to elevation angles smaller than 20?, and since the \u201cdownward-looking\u201d dual-polarization\nantenna was pointing to the horizon, the direct signal was also picked up (Fig. 6.88).\n\nThe altimetry solution is consistent with a 5 km resolution Arctic Ocean Tidal Inverse Model\n(AOTIM-5) (http://www.esr.org/polar_tide_models/Model_AOTIM5.html), at both LHCP and RHCP\npolarizations (Fig. 6.89A). Once the tides have been corrected for, the resulting mean sea ice level\ninversely relates to temperature (Fig. 6.89B), that is the cooler, the higher the sea ice level (thicker ice),\nand the warmer, the lower.\n\nFIGURE 6.88\n\nAntenna system mounted on the telecommunications tower, overlooking Disko Bay: (A) geometry of the\n\nexperiment, and (B) pictures taken in October 2008, during the installation of the equipment for the sea ice\n\ncampaign.\n\nFrom Fabra-Cervellera, F., 2013.

Early research in this area (Komjathy et al., 2000) showed that the\npower of the reflected signal strongly depended on the type of ice, and therefore it can be classified\naccordingly (Fig. 6.90).\n\nFIGURE 6.89\n\n(A) The altimetry solution follows closely the ocean tides at both polarizations, and (B) after correction of tides,\n\nthe altimetry solution inversely follows the iced sea temperature.\n\nFrom Fabra-Cervella, F., Cardellach, E., Rius, A., Ribo, S., Oliveras, S., Nogues-Correig, O., Belmonte-Rivas, M., Semmling, M.,\n\nD\u2019Addio, S., 2012.

Roughness is also sensitive to\ndeformation processes that affect the ice pack (Rivas et al., 2010).\n\nThe RHCP/LHCP polarimetric ratio (amplitude) and the polarimetric phase shifts also contain\ninformation relative to the dielectric constant that can be used to infer geophysical information (Fabra-\nCervella et al., 2012; Fabra-Cervella, 2013). The sea ice cover evolution (Fig. 6.91A) is linked to the\nexample of the evolution of the polarimetric ratio for three different satellites, and how it changes from\nw0.3 tow0.7 when the sea ice concentration passes from 0% to almost 100% (Fig. 6.91B). Similarly,\nFig. 6.91c shows the phase difference changes from w180? for 0% to w120? when the sea ice\nconcentration passes from 0% to 100%.\n\n6.4.5.5.3 Snow Depth\nThe same physical phenomena that produces the fringe pattern with multiple valleys in Figs. 6.75,\n6.78, 6.79, or 6.85, can be used to infer snow thickness. The issue is, in practice, more complex, since\nusually the topography in mountain regions is not flat, and snow height may vary significantly from\none place to a nearby one.

Fig. 6.95 shows the retrieved\nsnow height profile at a geodetic site with a standard GNSS receiver (Larson and Nievinski, 2013) (see\nFig. 6.95).\n\n6.4.5.5.4 Dry Snow Substructure\nIn Antarctica and Greenland deep snow layers exist, up to w3000e4000 m thick (Fig. 6.96A). In\naddition, there are underground lakes of liquid water (Fig. 6.96B) that have been found to affect the\nL-band brightness temperatures as measured from space. Since dry snow is nearly transparent to\nL-band, GNSS signals can penetrate down to a few hundreds of meters deep.\n\nSince the interfaces are smooth, and the dielectric constant gradient is relatively small coherent\nreflections occur, and interference patterns appeared generated by reflections at multiple substructure\nlayers giving information on the location of the most reflecting layers. A multilayer model consisting\nof layers of homogeneous dielectric constant (Fig. 6.97) can be used to explain the observed behavior\nof the reflected waveforms: a kind of superposition of a few waveforms, whose peaks are at increasing\ndelays, and rotating at a given frequency, which is given by the residual Doppler frequency Fig. 6.98.\n\nFIGURE 6.92\n\n(A) Simulated fringe pattern for a 40 cm thick snow, (B) measured and simulated fringe patterns showing\n\nthree notches.\n\nFrom Rodriguez-Alvarez, N., Aguasca, A., Valencia, E., Bosch-Luis, X., Camps, A., Ramos-Perez, I., Vall-Ilossera, M., 2012.

His first major astro-\nnomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum, was first published in defense of the Copernican system\nof planetary motions. While teaching in Graz, Kepler developed a system of complex geometrical\nshapes which seemed to explain the orbital motions of the six known planets, which were Mercury,\nVenus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. As suggested in the title, Kepler thought he had deduced God\u2019s\ngeometrical plan for the universe. His enthusiasm for the Copernican system came from his theological\nbeliefs connecting the physical and spiritual. After the publication of the Mysterium, Kepler began a\nvery ambitious program to extend his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary\naspects of the universe; one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and\ntheir geographical features; and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth including meteorology\nand astrology.\n\nBy 1599 Kepler felt that his theoretical work was limited by the inaccuracy of the available data at a\ntime when increasing religious tension threatened his continued employment in Graz. In December\nTycho Brahe invited Kepler to visit him in Prague where Tycho had just built a new observatory. Kepler\nwent to Prague in February 1600 and began looking at Brahe\u2019s data. While Tycho was generally very\ntight with his data, Kepler\u2019s theoretical understanding impressed Brahe and he allowed Kepler greater\naccess to the data collected. Kepler planned to test his theory of theMysterium using data collected on\nMars.\n\nAn argument with Brahe caused a brief interruption in Kepler\u2019s work, but in June 1600 he returned\nto Graz to retrieve his family. Political and religious difficulties kept Kepler from returning imme-\ndiately to Prague, but on August 2, 1600, after refusing to convert to Catholicism, Kepler and his\nfamily were banished from Graz and moved to Prague. Through most of 1601 he was supported by\nTycho, who assigned Kepler to analyzing planetary observations. Two days after the sudden death of\nTycho Brahe on October 24, 1601, Kepler was appointed as his successor as imperial mathematician\nwith the responsibility of finishing the work that Tycho had begun. The next 11 years would be the\nmost productive of Kepler\u2019s life.\n\nKepler\u2019s research in this period culminated in the Astronomia nova (new astronomy) including the\nfirst two laws of planetary motion. This line of study had started with the study of Mars\u2019 orbit under\nthe direction of Tycho Brahe. With Kepler\u2019s religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of God\n\nCHAPTER\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Remote Sensing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00007-5\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n565\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00007-5\n\n\nthe Father) was the source of all motive force in the solar system causing faster or slower movements as\nplanets move closer or farther away from the Sun.\n\nHe worked on the orbit of Mars using an egg-shaped, ovoid orbit. After 40 failed attempts, Kepler\nsettled on an ellipse, which had previously seemed too simple a solution for astronomers to have\noverlooked. Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the data for Mars, he then concluded that all other planets\nmove in ellipses with the Sun as the focus.\n\nPolitics drove Kepler back to Linz, Austria, where his wife died from Hungarian spotted fever,\nwhich she had contracted in Prague. All three of his children became ill with smallpox and one of\nthem, Friedrich, of age 6 died. In Linz, Kepler taught at the district school and provided astronomical\nand astrological services to the local government.\n\nSince the publication of Astronomia nova Kepler had intended to write an astronomy textbook. In\n1615, he completed the first of three volumes of Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae (Epitome of\nCopernican Astronomy); the first volume (books IeIII) was printed in 1617, the second (book IV) in\n1620, and the third (books VeVII) in 1621. The title referred to heliocentrism, but the texts also\ninvolved Kepler\u2019s own ellipse-based orbital system. The Epitome became Kepler\u2019s most influential\nwork. It contained all three of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain the\nmovements of celestial bodies through physical means.\n\nA spin-off from the Rudolphine Tables (which he had started work on in Prague) and related to a\nlatter work known as the ephemerides, Kepler also published astrological calendars, which were very\npopular and helped to offset the costs of producing his other more scientific books. In these calendars,\nproduced between 1617 and 1624, Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well as political\nevents. The latter turned out to be cannily accurate thanks to his keen insight into present-day politics.\nHis calendars became very controversial and the last one in 1624 was publicly burned in Graz.\n\nKepler was convinced that \u201cthe geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for\ndecorating the whole world.\u201d In publishing his next work Harmonices Mundi, Kepler attempts to\nexplain the astronomical and astrological aspects of the known world in terms of music (harmonies).\nUnfortunately, this led to a dispute with Robert Fludd who had recently published his theory of har-\nmonies. Among many other harmonies, Kepler explained what later became to be known as Kepler\u2019s\nthird law of planetary motion. In this law Kepler states that the square of the periodic times are to each\nother as the cubes of the mean distances. He gave no indication as to how he came up with this idea, but\nit was later found to be consistent with gravitational theory by Isaac Newton and his contemporaries\nsuch as Robert Hooke and Edmund Halley.\n\nIn 1623 Kepler at last completed the Rudolphine Tables that he had started in Prague with Tycho\nBrahe. Politics and the \u201c30-years war\u201d kept them from publication until 1627 when Kepler had to have\nthem printed at his own expense. In 1625 agents of the Catholic Counter-Reformation placed most of\nKepler\u2019s library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to Ulm and\nultimately to Regensburg. Soon after arriving in Regensburg, Kepler became ill and died there on\nNovember 15, 1630, where he was buried.\n\n7.2 KEPLER\u2019S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION\nTo preface our discussion of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion, it needs to be observed that these laws\ncan be derived from Newton\u2019s law of gravitation and the laws of motion when it is assumed that the\n\n566 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\norbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor. The basic tool used in all\norbital mechanics studies is differential calculus. Standard assumptions in astrodynamics include\nnoninterference from outside bodies, negligible mass for one of the bodies, and negligible other forces\n(such as solar wind, atmospheric drag, etc.). More complicated calculations can be made numerically\nwithout these assumptions when one considers the perturbations from the classical system and studies\nthe orbital anomalies.\n\n7.2.1 KEPLER\u2019S FIRST LAW\nThe orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci of the ellipse (Fig. 7.1A). The\namount of \u201cstretching\u201d from a perfect circle is known as the eccentricity of the ellipse.1 A circle is an\nellipse with zero eccentricity. The eccentricities of the planets vary from 0.007 for Venus to 0.2 for\nMercury. After the discovery of Kepler\u2019s laws, many celestial bodies have been identified with highly\neccentric orbits. Heavenly bodies such as comets and asteroids can have parabolic or even hyperbolic\norbits under Newtonian theory.\n\n7.2.2 KEPLER\u2019S SECOND LAW\nA line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. The planet\nmoves faster near the Sun, so the same area is swept out in a given time as at larger distances, where the\nplanet moves more slowly. Isaac Newton had proved Kepler\u2019s second law, as described in his Principia\nMathematica. If an instantaneous force is considered on the planet during its orbit, the vector defined\nfrom the Sun to the planet sweeps the same area in a fixed time interval (Fig. 7.1B). When the interval\ntends to zero, the force can be considered continuous.\n\n(A) (B) (C)\n\nSun\n\nPlanet\n\nT days\nT days\n\nP2 ? a3\n\nSun\n\nP: period or time to complete an orbit\na: semimajor axis of the ellipse\n\nP\n\na\n\nFIGURE 7.1\n\nGraphical representation of the three Keplerian laws.\n\n1The formal definition of the eccentricity is e \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1? \u00f0b=a\u00de2\n\nq\n, where a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes of the\n\nellipse.\n\n7.2 KEPLER\u2019S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION 567\n\n\n\n7.2.3 KEPLER\u2019S THIRD LAW\nAs stated in the history section earlier, Kepler\u2019s third law is: the square of the orbital period of a planet\nis directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit. This third law published by\nKepler in 1619 captures the relationship between the distance of the planets from the Sun and their\norbital periods. Using symbols, it can be written as:\n\nP2fa3; (7.1)\n\nwhere P is the orbital period of the planet in question and a is the semimajor axis of the orbital ellipse.2\n\nIf we suppose that the planet A is four times as far from the Sun as planet B, then planet A must\ntraverse 4 times the distance of planet B each orbit. Moreover, it turns out that planet A travels at half\nthe speed of planet B, to maintain equilibrium with the reduced gravitational-centripetal force due to\nbeing four times farther from the Sun. Thus, in total it takes 4 ? 2 \u00bc 8 times as long for planet A to\ntravel an orbit in agreement with the law (82 \u00bc 43). The third law can also be used to estimate the\ndistance from an exoplanet to its central star.\n\n7.2.4 THE TWO-BODY PROBLEM\nThe classical problem of a satellite orbiting a planet is called the two-body problem and amounts to\ndetermining the motion of two point particles that interact with each other (Fortescue et al., 2003). The\ntwo-body problem can be reformulated as two independent one-body problems; one of which is trivial\nand the other that involves solving for the motion of one particle in the presence of an external force\npotential. Since many one-body problems can be solved exactly the corresponding two-body problem\ncan also be solved.\n\nLet x1 and x2 be the positions of the two bodies and m1 and m2 be their masses. We wish to\ndetermine the trajectories x1(t) and x2(t) for all times t given the initial positions x1(t \u00bc 0) and x2(t \u00bc 0)\nand the initial velocities v1(t \u00bc 0) and v2(t \u00bc 0). Using Newton\u2019s second law they can be written as:\n\nF12\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc m1$d\n2x1\ndt2\n\n; (7.2)\n\nF21\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc m2$d\n2x2\ndt2\n\n; (7.3)\n\nwhere F12 is the force on mass 1 due to its interaction with mass 2 and vice versa. Adding and sub-\ntracting these two equations decouples them into two one-body problems, which can be solved\nindependently. Adding Eqs. (7.2) and (7.3) leads to an equation describing the motion of the center of\nmass (called the barycenter, Fig. 7.2).\n\nDividing both force equations by the respective masses and subtracting the second equation from\nthe first one and rearranging them, leads to:\n\nd2r\n\ndt2\n\u00bc d\n\n2x1\ndt2\n\n? d\n2x2\ndt2\n\n\u00bc F12\nm1\n\n? F21\nm2\n\n\u00bc\n?\n\n1\n\nm1\n\u00fe 1\nm2\n\n?\n$F12; (7.4)\n\n2In the case of a satellite orbiting the Earth, Eq. (7.1) is P \u00bc TE$\u00f0a=RE\u00de3=2, where TE \u00bc 84.4 minutes,\nand RE \u00bc 6378.1363 km is the reference radius of the Earth.\n\n568 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nwhere we have used Newton\u2019s third law that F12 \u00bc ?F21 and where r is the displacement vector from\nmass 2 to mass 1 (Fig. 7.2). The force between the two objects, which originates in the two objects,\nshould only be a function of their separation r and not of their absolute positions. This allows us to\nwrite Eq. (7.4) as:\n\nm$\nd2r\n\ndt2\n\u00bc F12\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc F\u00f0r\u00de; (7.5)\n\nwhere m is the reduced mass given by:\n\nm \u00bc 1\n1\n\nm1\n\u00fe 1\nm2\n\n\u00bc m1$m2\nm1 \u00fe m2 ; (7.6)\n\nActually, Eq. (7.5) is a set of 3 second order differential equations, that once solved require the\ndetermination of six independent integration constants. These constants are usually expressed in the form\nof the so-called Keplerian elements that completely determine the orbit3: the longitude of the ascending\nnode on the equatorial plane (U), the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the equatorial plane\n(i), measured at the ascending node where the orbit passes from South to North through the equatorial\nplane, the argument of the perigee (u) at the ascending node (g), or the angle from the ascending node to\nthe closest point at which the satellite comes to the primary object around which it is orbiting, the\nsemimajor axis of the ellipse (a), the orbit eccentricity (e), and the time of passage at the perigee (tp),\nwhich is the reference initial time. The physical meaning of these parameters is represented in Fig. 7.3.\n\nThe general solution of the two-body problem is:\n\nu\u00f0q\u00de \u00bc 1\nr\u00f0q\u00de \u00bc\n\nm\n\nh2\n\u00f01\u00fe e$cos\u00f0q? q0\u00de\u00de; (7.7)\n\nfor any nonnegative e.

For satellites at orbital\nheights abovew200 km, from all these perturbations the Earth\u2019s oblateness is by far the largest one. Real orbits can be accu-\nrately approximated by segments of ideal orbits.\n\n7.2 KEPLER\u2019S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION 569\n\n\n\nMost of the satellite orbits in Earth observation are nearly circular so this equation applies to them.\nThere are other highly elliptical orbits (HEOs) such as the Molniya orbits, and orbits to L1 and L2,\n\n4but\nhave a more reduced range of applications (see Fig. 7.6).\n\n7.2.5 LOW EARTH ORBITS\nA Low Earth orbit (LEO) orbit is generally defined as one with an altitude of 2000 km or less. Since the\norbital decay due to atmospheric drag is substantial below about 200 km, most LEO orbits are between\n160 and 2000 km. Most polar-orbiting weather satellites and some Earth mapping satellites generally\noperate in the 500e900 km range. Many of these weather and Earth mapping satellites are in what is\nknown as \u201cSun-synchronous orbits.\u201d A Sun-synchronous orbit (Fig. 7.4) describes the orbit of a sat-\nellite that provides consistent illumination of the Earth-scan view. The satellite passes over the equator\nand each line of latitude at about the same time each day. For example, a satellite\u2019s Sun-synchronous\norbit might cross the equator 12 to 15 times a day (depending on the orbital height) each time at about\n3:00 p.m. local time. The orbital plane of a Sun-synchronous orbit must also \u201cprecess\u201d (rotate)\napproximately one degree each day, eastward, to keep pace with the Earth\u2019s revolution around the Sun.\nActually the regression of the orbital plane must satisfy:\n\nDU \u00bc 2p P\nTes\n\nrad\n\norbit\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 2p rad\n\nyear\n\n? ?\n; (7.9)\n\nwhere P is the orbital period, and Tes \u00bc 3,155,815 ? 107 s is the EartheSun orbital period.\n\nFIGURE 7.3\n\nGraphical explanation of the six Keplerian elements\n\nof an ideal orbit.\n\n4The L1 point lies on the line defined by the two masses (e.g. the Earth and the Sun), and between them, and corresponds to\nthe point where the gravitational attraction of both masses cancels out, and the L2 point lies on the line defined by the two\nmasses, beyond the smaller one, and corresponds to the point where the gravitational forces of the two masses compensate\nthe centrifugal force on a body at this point.\n\n570 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nOther polar orbits require the synchronization with the Earth to overpass periodically the same\ngeographical location. These orbits require that:\n\nnjDUj \u00bc m$2p; (7.10)\nwhere n is the number of orbits, m is the number of Earth revolutions (days), and\n\njDUj \u00bc jDU1 \u00fe DU2j \u00bc\n????? 2p PTe ? 3p\n\nRE\na\n\n? ?2\n$\n\n1\n\n1? e2\u00f0 \u00de2\n$J2$cos\u00f0i\u00de\n\n????. (7.11)\nIn Eq. (7.11), the first term (DU1) is the Earth\u2019s rotation in one orbit, which is the dominant term,\n\nand the second one (DU2) is the so-called regression of the ascending node, which is a perturbing effect\ndue to the Earth\u2019s oblateness, that creates an asymmetry of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. Other\nparameters in Eq. (7.11) are Te z 86164,09055 s z 23 h 54 min, which is the Earth\u2019s rotation period\nwith respect to the stars, J2 \u00bc 1082,6 ? 10?6, and i is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nSUN\n\nHIGH ILLUMINATION\nANGLE AT DATA AREA\n\nEASTWARD\n\nNIGHT CONTACT\nWITH GROUND\n\nAUTUMNAL\nEQUINOXVERNAL\n\nEQUINOX\n\nTERMINATOR\n\nWINTER SOLSTICE\n\nSATELLITE ORBIT PLANE PRECESSES EASTWARD\nABOUT 1\u00b0 PER DAY\n\nLOW ILLUMINATION\nANGLE AT DATA AREA\n\nNORTH\nPOLE\n\nSUMMER\nSOLSTICE\n\nFIGURE 7.4\n\nSeasonal changes in a Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\n7.2 KEPLER\u2019S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION 571\n\n\n\nFinally, some missions require the synchronization with the Sun and with the Earth simultaneously,\nwhich requires Eqs. (7.9) and (7.10) to be satisfied at the same time:\n\nn$\n\n????? 2p PTe \u00fe 2p\nP\n\nTes\n\n???? \u00bc m$2p; (7.12)\nor:\n\nn$P\n\n?\n1\n\nTe\n? 1\nTes\n\n?\n\u00bc m. (7.13)\n\nThese orbits are usually referred to by the two integers n:m. For example, a 14:1 orbit will repeat\nexactly the first ground-track in the 15th orbit, at the expense of a separation between consecutive\nground-tracks of\n\nd \u00bc 2p\nn\n$RE \u00bc 2862:43 km; (7.14)\n\nwhich is excessive for Earth observation satellites taking into account the field of view (FOV) of most of\nthe sensors studied in previous chapters. Therefore, other combinations of n andm are selected to achieve\na much narrower separation between adjacent ground-tracks, at the expense of a much longer revisit\ntime. Following with the example aforementioned, LANDSAT 1 and 2 satellites used a 251:18 orbit,\nwhich means that they performed 251 orbits in 18 days (very close to the 14:1 orbit), with a separation\nbetween tracks about 160 km. Once these conditions are defined, the rest of the orbit parameters are\ndefined, in this case the orbital period was 103 min, the inclination of the orbit was 99?, and an orbital\nheight at the apogee (point in the orbit with the largest distance to the center of the Earth) of 920 km.\n\nUsually these weather satellites \u201cfly\u201d in pairs with one satellite having a morning crossing which\ntakes advantage of the fact that clouds are at a minimum before the diurnal solar heating gets going.\nThe other satellite in this constellation has a mid-afternoon crossing designed to sample at the solar\nmax when the land surface vegetation would be the most responsive. This is done at the expense of\nincreased cloud cover in the afternoon pass.\n\nThe primary advantage of the LEO orbit is that the closeness of the Earth allows better resolution of\nsurface features and gives stronger reflected and emitted signals for the satellite sensors. These polar\nLEO orbits have the added advantage that this resolution is maintained over the entire Earth\u2019s surface,\nunlike geostationary satellites whose resolution decreases dramatically toward the poles. Due to sensor\nswath overlap the polar-orbiting satellites generally see an improvement in satellite coverage as the\nsensor swaths overlap at higher latitudes.\n\nThere areLEOsatellites that are not inSun-synchronouspolar orbits, and frequently these satellites are\nin much lower inclination orbits designed to optimally cover the tropical to mid-latitude portion of the\nEarth. Such a satellitewas the Tropical RainfallMappingMission (TRMM),whichwas designed to study\nthe precipitation in the tropical region. Data from TRMM found many other applications like the passive\nmicrowavemapping of sea surface temperature (SST) from the 10 GHz channel. This SSTwas, however,\nrestricted to the 40?N to 40?S orbit of the TRMM satellite. Thus, while the microwave SSTwould have\nbeen a great benefit to mapping SST in the polar regions, it was not possible with the TRMM radiometer.\n\nIt should be noted that receiving antennas designed to collect data from these satellites must be able\nto track the satellite as it moved from horizon to horizon. Early in the lives of these satellites that was\naccomplished by a very costly antenna system with a multihorn receiver, which could sense the\n\n572 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nsatellites motion and thus track its signal. Later it was realized that much less expensive antenna\nsystems could be used that used the orbital ephemeris data to predict the location of the satellite and\ncould command the antenna movement with this information. This led to a great revolution in polar-\norbiter antenna systems.\n\nThe next big change in weather satellite data was the realization that it was not necessary for\neveryone to operate their own antennas as it would be a lot more cost-effective if a central data re-\npository was created and the satellite data were staged and delivered over the web. Such a system is the\nComprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS). This system was set up to handle all\nof the US weather satellite data including the advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)\n(HRPT, GAC, and LAC) and GOES data. Recently, CLASS has been extended to include AVHRR and\nother weather data from satellites operating around the world. As long as the data are requested and\ndelivered online there is no charge for the imagery.\n\nMost communications satellites are deployed in geostationary orbit (GEO), which provides poor\ncoverage to higher latitudes. To overcome this limitation, the Iridium constellation of satellites was\ncreated. Initially created by Motorola Corp., this system is now operated by the US Department of\nDefense. The principle is that by connecting with a number of satellites in LEO can provide continuous\ncoverage a series of polar-orbiting satellites. The Iridium constellation uses 66 LEO satellites, which\nare distributed in a staggered manner over six orbits (11 satellites per orbit) 30? apart. There are also\nsome additional spare satellites that can be brought online in case of a satellite failure. Satellites are in\nLEO at an altitude of 781 km with an inclination of 86.4? and an orbital period of 100 min approx-\nimately. Satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via four Ka-band intersatellite links: two\nneighbors fore and aft in the same orbital plane, and two satellites in neighboring planes to either side.\nThis polar design gives equal communications potential at all latitudes unlike the geostationary\ncommunications satellites. Since the communications areas of each satellite overlap this constellation\nthese satellites provide continuous communications at every point on the globe.\n\nIridium NEXT is the second generation version of this system, and the first ten Iridium NEXT\nsatellites were successfully launched on January 14, 2017, using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It will\ncontinue the 66 satellite constellation, with six on-orbit and nine on-ground spare satellites. This\nimproved system will have new features such as data transmission which was not emphasized in the\noriginal design intended primarily for voice communications. These satellites will carry some addi-\ntional payloads such as cameras and other sensors. This new constellation will provide L-band data\nspeeds of up to 1.5 Mbps and high-speed Ka-Band service of up to 8 Mbps. The existing constellation\nof satellites is expected to remain operational until Iridium NEXT is fully operational with many of the\nsatellites to remain in service until the 2020\u2019s. This new system is being built by Thales Alenia Space\nin a $2.1 billion deal. In June 2010, Iridium signed the largest commercial rocket launch deal ever at\nthat time, a US$492 million contract with SpaceX to launch 10 Iridium NEXT satellites on 7 Falcon 9\nrockets from 2017 onward from the Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex.\n\nIridium Communications Inc. (formerly known as GHL Acquisition Corp.) was incorporated under\nthe laws of the state of Delaware on November 2, 2007; completed its initial public offering on\nFebruary 1, 2008. On September 24, 2009, following shareholder approval of the acquisition by GHL\nAcquisition Corp. of Iridium Holdings LLC, GHL Acquisition Corp. began trading on NASDAQ under\nthe IRDM trading symbol. At the closing of the acquisition on September 29, 2009, GHL Acquisition\nCorp. was renamed Iridium Communications Inc.\n\n7.2 KEPLER\u2019S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION 573\n\n\n\n7.2.6 GEOSTATIONARY ORBITS\nSince the goal of GEOs is to have the satellite constantly pointing at the same location on the Earth\nthere is only one altitude where this is possible and that is at 35,786 km over the equator (inclination\nequal to zero degrees). At this altitude the satellite orbits the Earth at such a speed as to be constantly\nviewing the same spot on the ground. Here the satellite is in a circular orbit and rotates at the same rate\nas the rotation of the Earth, and therefore appears to remain stationary in the sky even while orbiting\nthe Earth at a very high altitude. This orbit is ideal for both communications satellites and for weather\nsatellites. In this orbit antennas do not have to track the satellite\u2019s motion, but can remain fixed oriented\ntoward the satellite of interest. The idea of a geosynchronous satellite for communication purposes was\nfirst published in 1928 (Potocnik, 1928). It caught on much later when Clarke (1945) wrote a paper on\nhow it would work for wireless communications.\n\nMost commercial communications satellites, broadcast satellites, and SBAS satellites operate in\nGEOs. A geostationary transfer orbit is used tomove a satellite fromLEO into a GEO. Russian television\nsatellites have used highly ellipticalMolniya andTundra orbits5 due to the high latitudes of the receiving\naudience. The first satellite placed into a GEOwas the Syncom-3, launched by a Delta-D rocket in 1964.\n\nThere is also a world constellation of geostationary weather satellites. In the United States these\nsatellites were first spin-stabilized requiring a new mechanism to scan the Earth. In the polar-orbiters\nthe forward movement of the spacecraft is used to increment the line-scan and thus produce an image.\nThis problem was solved by Dr. Vern Suomi of the University of Wisconsin who invented the spin-scan\ncamera, which later became the visible infrared spin scan radiometer (VISSR). Since atmospheric\nsoundings are a critical part of meteorological forecasting a VISSR atmospheric sounder (VAS) was\ncreated. It suffered from the fact that since it is difficult to accurately sense vertical profiles of at-\nmospheric temperature and moisture the VAS profiles were far less accurate than those from the\nTIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Interestingly enough when data from TOVS first\nbecame available for weather forecasting in late 1982 it was found that the atmospheric models\nperformed worse when the temperature and moisture profiles from TOVS were assimilated into the\nweather forecast models. In spite of their much greater spatial coverage these data did not improve the\nmodel forecast. It was later discovered that the source of this problem was the fact that the temperature\nand water vapor moisture vertical profiles were very noisy and were introducing more noise in the\nsolution than signal. This problem was overcome when it was realized that the numerical models could\nproduce the radiances that were collected by TOVS and therefore the radiances themselves were\ndirectly assimilated into the model. This dramatically improved the weather forecast model results,\nand it became a regular practice to assimilate the TOVS radiances into the forecast models.\n\n7.2.6.1 US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites\nThe Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) program grew out of the experimental\nStationary Meteorological Satellite program where NASA tested out systems such as the spin-scan\ncamera. Once it was established that this system worked, the GOES program was turned over to\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for continuing operation and data\ndelivery to users. The provision of timely weather information including the advance warning of\n\n5Molniya and Tundra orbits have an inclination of 63.4? to have zero precession of the orbital plane. Molniya orbits have an\norbital period of w12 h, while Tundra orbits have an orbital period of w24 h. Both spend most of the orbital period over a\nchosen area of the Earth, a phenomenon known as apogee dwell.\n\n574 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\ndeveloping and impending storms is the primary function of GOES. GOES 1e3 simply carried a\nVISSR imager and it was not until GOES-4 that VAS profiler was included. This second generation\nGOES satellite also had the Earth-pointing antennas in a nonrotating module at the bottom of the\nplatform so that they could point continuously at the antennas on the ground.\n\nAlso in this new generation of GOES satellite a Weather Facsimile (WEFEX) capability where the\nGOES imagery was analyzed on the group on the ground and the analyzed product was then broadcast\nback through the GOES communication capabilities to ground and ship stations that were not able to\nreceive the original image. The GOES satellites also carried a space environment monitor (SEM),\nwhich investigated solar particle emissions and helped study the effect of solar activity on Earth\u2019s\ntelecommunications systems. The SEM detected solar protons, alpha particles, solar electrons, solar\nX-rays, and magnetic fields.\n\nThe United States operates two GOES satellites (Fig. 7.5) one located at 75?Wand one at 135?W\nlongitude. Why two satellites when only one can cover the entire United States? Well GOES West is\nclearly designed to sense all of the bad weather that hits the United States and comes out of the West.\nThis includes storms that form in the Gulf of Alaska and enter the northwestern United States. GOES\nEast is designed to sense hurricanes and other severe weather conditions on the eastern portion of the\nUnited States.\n\n7.2.7 HIGHLY ELLIPTICAL ORBITS\nA HEO is one with a low-altitude (about 1000 km) at perigee and a very high-altitude (greater than\n35,786 km) at apogee. These very elongated orbits have the advantage of long dwell times at a point in\nthe sky during the approach to and descent from apogee. Spacecraft visibility near the apogee can\nexceed 12 h with a much faster movement at the perigee. These bodies moving through the long\napogee can appear almost stationary to the ground when the orbit is in the right inclination and the\nangular velocity of the orbit in the equatorial plane closely matches the rotation of the Earth surface\nbeneath it. Thus, these orbits are also useful for some communications satellites. Sirius satellite radio\nuses HEO orbits to keep two satellites positioned above North America while another satellite quickly\nsweeps through the southern part of its 24 h orbit. The longitude above which the satellite dwell at\napogee remains fairly constant as the Earth rotates. A special HEO orbit is the \u201cMolniya orbit\u201d named\nafter a series of Soviet communication satellites, which used them.\n\nFIGURE 7.5\n\nGOES East and GOES West satellite\n\ncoverage.\n\n7.2 KEPLER\u2019S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION 575\n\n\n\nThe L2 orbit is an elliptical orbit about the semistable second Lagrange point. It is one of the five\nsolutions by the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the 18th century to the three-body problem.\nLagrangewas searching for a stable configuration in which three bodies could orbit each other yet stay in\nthe sameposition relative to each other.He foundfive such solutions, and they are called thefiveLagrange\npoints in honor of their discoverer. In three of the solutions found by Lagrange, the bodies are in line (L1,\nL2, and L3); in the other two, the bodies are at the points of equilateral triangles (L4 and L5). The five\nLagrangian points for the SuneEarth system are shown in the diagram further. An object placed at any\none of these five points will stay in place relative to the other two. In the case of the James Webb Space\nTelescope, the three bodies involved are the Sun, the Earth, and theWebb telescope. Normally, an object\ncircling the Sun further out than the Earth would take more than one year to complete its orbit. However,\nthe balance of gravitational pull at the L2 pointmeans that theWebb telescopewill keep upwith the Earth\nas it goes around the Sun. The gravitational forces of the Sun and the Earth can nearly hold a spacecraft at\nthis point, so that it takes relatively little rocket thrust to keep the spacecraft in orbit around L2.\n\nThe five Lagrange points are illustrated here in Fig. 7.6, which is enlarged to clearly show the\nrelationships between the various elements. The Lagrange Points are positions where the gravitational\npull of two large masses precisely equals the centripetal force required for a small object to move with\nthem. This general \u201cThree-Body-Problem\u201d was addressed by Lagrange in his prize-winning paper\n(Essai sur le Probleme des Trois Corps, 1772). The L1 point (Fig. 7.6) of the EartheSun system\nprovides an uninterrupted view of the Sun and is currently home to the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory Satellite (SOHO). It is also the home of LISA Pathfinder (LPF), launched on December 3,\n2015, which arrived at L1 on January 22, 2016. The L2 point of this EartheSun system was home to the\nWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), current home of ESA\u2019s Planck mission, and\nthe future home of the JamesWebb Space Telescope. L2 is ideal for astronomy observations because the\nspacecraft is close enough to readily communicate with the Earth, can keep Sun, Earth, and Moon\nbehind the spacecraft for solar power and, with appropriate shielding, it provides a clear view of deep\nspace for space telescopes. The L1 and L2 points are unstable with periods of approximately 23 days,\nwhich requires satellites orbiting these positions to undergo regular course and attitude corrections.\n\nFIGURE 7.6\n\nLagrange Points of the EartheSun system (not drawn to scale).\n\n576 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nThe L3 point remains hidden behind the Sun at all times and thus is not a useful position for\nspacecraft sensing. The idea of a hidden Planet-X at the L3 point has been a popular science fiction\ntopic for many years. The L4 and L5 points are locations of stable orbits so long as the mass ratio\nbetween the two large masses exceeds 24.96. This restriction is satisfied for both the EartheSun and\nEartheMoon systems, and for many other pairs of bodies in the solar system.\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION\nWhen working with satellite images one must realize that satellites view the Earth differently\ndepending on their orbits. As described in the previous chapter the primary orbits for Earth-oriented\nsatellites are LEO and GEO. LEO satellites travel approximately from pole to pole as the Earth rotates\nbeneath it. Thus, the satellite image sensor sees a curved Earth that is rotating as the satellite flies\noverhead. This requires geometric corrections for both these effects. These geometric corrections can\nbe carried out using an accurate knowledge of the satellite ephemeris data, which provide the time and\nlocation where the satellite views the Earth (Emery et al., 2010; Rosbourgh et al., 1994).\n\nAdditional corrections that must be made are the compensation for spacecraft attitude that controls\nwhere the sensor is pointing to (Emery et al., 2010). Most modern satellites now perform this correction\nusing auxiliary information from the onboard \u201cstar trackers\u201d that calculate the actual spacecraft attitude\nusing views of known stars. Added to the geometric corrections for curvature and rotation this \u201cimage\nnavigation\u201d as it is commonly called can geolocate an image pixel down to its native spatial resolution.\n\nPrior to the wide use of star trackers, satellite orientation sensors were much more limited and were\nbased on Sun and Earth horizon sensors. The inaccuracies inherent in these sensors led to very poorly\nnavigated or geolocated satellite images. In response to these inaccuracies corrections were made to the\nimages themselves. Very often these correctionsweremade to force significant landmarks in each image to\ncorrespond to the corresponding\u201cground control points\u201d on thedesiredmap.Emery et al. (2010)developed\nan automated routine to perform these attitude corrections for AVHRR 1 km imagery, creating accurately\ncorrected base images in the thermal infrared using a maximum cross-correlation (MCC) technique to\nautomatically calculate the attitude corrections that would produce an accurately mapped image.\n\nOne significant advantage to this method is that the attitude parameters calculated over a coastal\nregion can be propagated out over the ocean where no landmarks are available to correct the image.\nThis makes it possible to correctly navigate the large archive of AVHRR data that is readily available\nvia NOAA\u2019s CLASS archival system. Here one can order AVHRR online and pick it up by FTP for\nfree. This has led to a real change in the way weather satellite imagery can be used.\n\n7.3.1 MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF THE EARTH\u2019S SURFACE\nBefore choosing a map projection for the satellite imagery, it is required first to define how to model\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. Human understanding on the Earth\u2019s shape has varied during history. Pythagoras\n(550 BC) was the first one admitting Earth\u2019s sphericity, Aristotle (384 BC) saw the Earth\u2019s shadow\nover the Moon (eclipses), and Eratosthenes (250 BC) was able to calculate the circumference of the\nEarth by measuring the Sun\u2019s angle elevation at noon in Alexandria, and knowing that at local noon on\nthe summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt) the Sun was directly overhead. The method\nof measurement consisted of making a scale drawing of that triangle which included a right angle\nbetween a vertical rod and its shadow, as illustrated in Fig. 7.7.\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION 577\n\n\n\nDuring the middle ages, all this knowledge was lost, and it was not until the Renaissance when\nthese ideas were revived. Later, Sir Isaac Newton concluded that the Earth is a fluid rotating itself, so it\nshould have the shape of an ellipsoid of revolution.\n\nThe simplest model the Earth\u2019s surface can then be is either a sphere or an ellipsoid. Spherical\nmodels are generally useful for large area maps such as world atlases and maps overlain on globes. At\nthese scales the map error is not noticeable as it is not large relatively to the scales of the maps. For\nmore localized and precise maps an ellipsoid (either local or global) is used to map the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThis ellipsoid is sufficient for most topographic maps or other zoomed-in area maps.\n\nA third model of the Earth\u2019s shape is known as the geoid, which is a complex and more accurate\nrepresentation of the Earth\u2019s surface. The geoid is a hypothetical surface of constant gravity field, i.e.,\nthe gravity field vector is constant to this surface, and therefore calm water bodies appear as flat\nsurfaces. The geoid is critically important for mapping global mean sea level from satellite altimeters,\nand it is computed using both terrestrial and satellite gravity measurements. The geoid itself is not used\nfor mapping applications, but digital elevation models (DEMs) are usually referred to it, so that DEMs\nhave the physical meaning as the height above sea level. The geoid can be approximated by a global\nellipsoid with a maximum error of ?100 m. Datums are usually constructed for specific regions such\n\nFIGURE 7.7\n\nIllustration showing a portion of the globe. The\n\nsunbeams shown as two rays hitting the ground.\n\nAngle of the sunbeams and the gnomons (vertical\n\nsticks) is shown at Alexandria, which allowed\n\nEratosthenes\u2019 estimates of radius and circumfer-\n\nence of Earth (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_\n\nLIB/Geodesy4Layman/80003002.GIF).\n\n578 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\nhttp://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/Geodesy4Layman/80003002.GIF\nhttp://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/Geodesy4Layman/80003002.GIF\n\n\nas the North American Datum from 1927, or 1983 (NAD27 or NAD83), or the European Datum from\n1950 or 1979 (ED50 or ED79), which have been replaced today by the European Terrestrial Reference\nSystem 1989 (ETRS89). There are also global datums such as the World Geodetic System, 1984\n(WGS84), used in the global positioning system, which is optimized to represent the whole Earth with\na single ellipsoid at the expense of similar accuracy in specific smaller regions. A datum is defined by\nseven parameters: a and b the major and minor semiaxes of the ellipsoid; Dx, Dy, Dz that are the\nellipsoid center with respect to the center of mass of the Earth, and a, b, g that are the rotations to align\nthe ellipsoid axes with respect to the Earth axes.6 The transformations between different datums are\nperformed using the so-called BursaeWolf or Helmert transformations (Mart??n-As??n, 1990). Its\ndetailed description is out of the scope of this book.\n\n7.3.2 IMAGE GEOREFERENCING\nGeoreferencing is the process of scaling, rotating, translating, and deskewing an image to match a\nparticular size and location (usually chosen to fit a selected map projection). All satellite images are\nraster images made up of pixels that are not naturally located at any locations on a particular map\nprojection. Without georeferencing the image is defined by the width and height of the image in pixels\neach of which has its own resolution (counts per pixel). This image size alone usually has no direct\nrelationship to the map locations corresponding to the pixel locations. What is needed is a method to\nassign the vector locations in a vector map file to the pixel locations in the satellite raster file. What is\nusually done is to find the correct \u201cimage navigation\u201d that locates the pixel elements to the selected\nmap projection and then resample the image to match this map projection.\n\n7.3.2.1 THE ADVANCED VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIOMETER AS AN EXAMPLE:\nGEOMETRIC CORRECTIONS\n\nA good example of this need for georeferencing is the use of AVHRR data. The TIROS-N satellites that\ncarried the AVHRR were limited in their geolocation systems to an Earth horizon sensor and a Sun\nsensor. Thus, it is necessary to use information on the satellite\u2019s orbit to correct the images with the\nappropriate orbital model. In Fig. 7.8 we show the orbit of a typical TIROS-N satellite, which is in a\nhigh-inclination, Sun-synchronous polar orbit with a nominal altitude of 850 km. This orbit has a\nperiod of 102 min with a nadir repeat period of 7 days. One can clearly see the need to correct the\nAVHRR image for both Earth curvature and Earth rotation. This will be done using knowledge of the\nsatellite\u2019s orbit from ephemeris data. These data come from ground-tracking stations such as that\noperated by the US Air Force and the US Navy.\n\nAnother important consideration in correcting an AVHRR image for geometric distortions is the\nrealization that the movement of the scan mirror across track also modifies the pixel size at the edge of\neach scan line. This is clearly seen in Fig. 7.9, which shows the size of each AVHRR pixel as a function\nof scan angle.\n\n6In the above list, actually eight parameters have been defined, but in practice only seven are used, because the shape of\nellipsoid (a and b) is preserved, just scaled by a factor m.\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION 579\n\n\n\nFIGURE 7.8\n\nTIROS-N satellite orbit.\n\n6\n\nR\nE\n\nS\nO\n\nLU\nTI\n\nO\nN\n\n (K\nM\n\n/P\nIX\n\nE\nL)\n\n8\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n0 10\n\n185 370 555 739 925 1024\nANGLE\n\nSPOT\nMIRROR ANGLE (DEG)\n\n20 30 40 50 60\n\nFIGURE 7.9\n\nA very high-resolution radiometer pixel size as a function of scan angle from nadir.\n\n580 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nHere it is clear that the AVHRR retains its basic resolution of about 1 km until about 40? in scan\nwhere the pixels get much larger as the main scan mirror continues to rotate and the Earth\u2019s curvature\nincreases. The AVHRR swath consists of 2048 pixels across each scan, which corresponds to\napproximately 3000 km. The instrument collects six scans per second. Beyond the 40? limit the pixel\nsize increases from about 2 to 7 km at about 55? scan angle where the field stop limits the size of the\nscan swath.\n\nTo better understand the effects of Earth curvature and rotation Fig. 7.10 with the AVHRR swath\noverlaid as a green line showing the swath and the precession of the orbit. As an artifact of the mapping\nprojection used, the swath width apparently increases toward the poles. The repeat period is\napproximately 7 days referred to the equator-crossing repeat time. The nature of a Sun-synchronous\norbit is to maintain the same solar relationship established by the equator crossing time. This will\nvary slightly over the 7-day repeat period.\n\nFrom Fig. 7.10 it is clear that satellite image data do not repeat for successive orbits. Also the\ngeometric distortions due to curvature and rotation are apparent. Orbit ephemeris information can be\nused to correct for these geometric distortions. There are two basic types of georeferencing. One is\ncalled \u201cdirect referencing\u201d that computes the latitude and longitude of the center of the instantaneous\nfield of view (IFOV). This does not change the image picture, but merely generates the location in-\nformation. In indirect referencing the FOV is calculated that contains a given latitude and longitude\n(Fig. 7.11). In this way, an image can be resampled to fit a given map projection. The advantage of this\nmethod is that there are no data gaps in the resultant image, but at the expense of having to repeat\npixels to fill in those areas where the pixel resolution expands with increasing scan angle. Still, this is\nthe dominant method applied in the routine georeferencing of AVHRR images (also called image\nnavigation).\n\nFIGURE 7.10\n\nAdvanced very high-resolution radiometer orbit and scan limits.\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION 581\n\n\n\nThe same image as presented in Fig. 7.11 is repeated here in Fig. 7.12 using the indirect method to\nproduce an accurately georeferenced image. In this indirect method a grid is specified by the user\nincluding geographic boundaries (coastlines, rivers, lakes, etc.), image pixel resolution, and the spe-\ncific map projection. The portion of a given satellite image that corresponds to this grid is\n\nFIGURE 7.11\n\nAn example of an advanced very high-resolution radiometer image of the US West Coast in satellite\n\nperspective.\n\nFIGURE 7.12\n\nAn example of the image in Fig. 7.11 georegistered with the indirect method.\n\n582 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\ngeoregistered using the orbital model. Each grid point is defined by an (i,j) position in the grid and each\nFOV is then selected using the orbital model and the appropriate ephemeris data. This FOV is then\ninserted at the appropriate location.\n\nThe steps in this indirect navigation are:\n\n1. A vector R from the center of the Earth to the latitude, longitude of interest is constructed.\n2. Using the orbital model at the time that this latitude, longitude pair was observed is computed. It\n\nis important to realize that time is the critical link between the ground and the satellite on orbit.\nThis solution requires iteration with an initial choice of the spacecraft time at which the position\nand velocity of the spacecraft are calculated. A \u201clook vector d\u201d is then calculated that points from\nthe spacecraft to the latitude, longitude of interest (Fig. 7.13).\n\nNext transform d to d0 a vector in a coordinate system centered on the satellite. If the time is\ncorrect, vector d0 will be in the scan plane. Now compute the angular difference between d0 and the\nscan plane.

These remaining errors are due\nprimarily to a lack of precise knowledge of the exact pointing angle of the AVHRR sensor, which\ndepends on the attitude of the spacecraft. In the next section a method to correct for these misalignment\nerrors will be presented. Other possible sources of registration errors are as follows: inaccuracies in the\nephemeris data [data used verified to be accurate to 0.5 (IFOV)], inaccuracies in the model (validated\nto be accurate to within 1 IFOV for daily ephemeris data), inaccuracies in the satellite clock (a clock\ndrift of ?0.5 s,w3 IFOV) results in registration errors of 4 IFOVs, and finally incorrect knowledge of\nthe satellite\u2019s roll, pitch, and yaw attitude alignment. It should be noted that TIROS-N clocks are\nnotorious for drifting, but that these drift errors can be compensated for by correcting the image for\npitch, since a time error will appear as an offset due to satellite pitch.\n\n7.3.3 ADVANCED VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIOMETER ACCURATE\nAUTOGEOREGISTRATION USING IMAGE CALCULATED ATTITUDE\nPARAMETERS\n\nIn an effort to automate the attitude corrections for AVHRR imagery Emery et al. (2010) developed a\nmethod using infrared reference \u201cbase images\u201d to compute MCCs between images that could then be\nconverted to spacecraft attitude corrections and applied more widely to similar images along the same\norbit. This MCC method is applied to widely dispersed cloud-free regions of the new and only\n\nFIGURE 7.14\n\nA geometrically corrected advanced very\n\nhigh-resolution radiometer image.\n\n584 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\ngeometrically corrected AVHRR image to find the offsets needed to bring the new image into\nagreement with the base image which has been very accurately georegistered. In the process these\ndisplacements are converted to attitude corrections (roll, pitch, and yaw) needed to bring the new\nAVHRR image into precise alignment with the AVHRR base image.\n\nThe MCC method was originally developed to calculate ocean surface currents from the dis-\nplacements of SST patterns between sequential images (Emery et al., 1986). In the image navigation\napplication there has been no movement of features between the images, but one image is distorted\nrelative to the base image and the MCC calculation is then used to determine the displacements needed\nto geocorrect the new image to match the base image. This procedure is depicted here in Fig. 7.15,\nwhich shows portions of both a base image on the left and the new (and distorted) image on the right.\n\nIt should be pointed out that an infrared image is generally used to generate the base image. This is\ndue to two effects: first infrared images are available both day and night and second an infrared image\nsenses emitted radiation and thus has no dependence on solar illumination angle. If a visible channel\nhad been used instead it would have a very specific dependence on solar angle and thus not be\ngenerally applicable for mapping all subsequent images. Since a critical factor is detecting cloud cover\neven in the infrared images both the thermal infrared and visible images are used together to define\nthose pixels that are considered to be dominated by clouds. These regions are not used to compute the\nMCC against the base image.\n\nThe AVHRR autonav algorithm (Emery et al., 2010) has three means of eliminating the effects of\nclouds. The first is a simple threshold method where pixels having brightness temperatures less than a\nuser specified value are ignored in the cross-correlation computation. The threshold value should be\nlarger than the brightness temperatures of the clouds present in the images. While this technique will\nidentify most of the cloudy pixels, it is likely that a few clouds will pass through and be used to compute\n\nFIGURE 7.15\n\nThe maximum cross-correlations method illustrated for two grid locations. The solid boxes in the first image\n\nare the template subwindows; this is the data feature to search for within the dashed search windows in the\n\nsecond image. The second-image subwindows that provide the highest cross-correlations suggest the most\n\nlikely displacements of the data features (solid boxes).\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION 585\n\n\n\ncross-correlations. Since the MCC method computes displacements by correlating data patterns\nbetween two images, each displacement vector has a correlation coefficient, which quantifies howwell a\npattern was matched. Displacements contaminated by clouds usually have low cross-correlations, and\neliminating all vectors with cross-correlations lower than the 95% confidence level (w0.7) is the second\nmeans of cloud filtering. The third step, known as the coherency filter, makes use of the fact that dis-\nplacements due tomisregistration are fairly coherent for local regions, while those due to clouds are not.\nThe coherency filter removes vectors that have different lengths and directions than their immediate\nneighbors. The three cloud filtering processes result in a set of vectors that represent the registration\noffsets of the target image without the influence of clouds.\n\nAn example of an AVHRR base image is included here in Fig. 7.16 for the US West Coast. Note\nthat this image is not totally without clouds, but has a really low amount of cloud cover. The most\nimportant fact about this cloud cover is that there are open areas widely distributed over the image\nwhere cloud-free portions of the new images can be used to calculate the MCC displacement vectors.\nThere are many coastal and inland river and lake features to match the infrared image to. Even with all\nof the efforts to make this image as exactly georegistered as possible, there are still some registration\nerrors as can be seen in some of the smaller lakes.\n\nAn unregistered image of approximately the same area as the base image in Fig. 7.16 is presented\nhere in Fig. 7.17. Note again the offsets of coastline features, displacements of rivers and lakes. There\nis quite a lot of clouds in this image, but fortunately the coast is almost cloud-free and enough of the\nrivers and lakes have relatively low cloud cover and can be used to compute the MCC offsets that will\nbe used to calculate the satellite attitude parameters.\n\nThe displacements calculate by the MCC method for the image in Fig. 7.17 are shown here in\nFig. 7.18.\n\nFIGURE 7.16\n\nA nighttime thermal infrared base image for\n\nthe US West Coast.\n\n586 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 7.17\n\nAn advanced very high-resolution radiom-\n\neter thermal infrared target image to be used\n\nfor autonav georegistration. Note the\n\nmisalignment of lakes, rivers, and coastline.\n\nFIGURE 7.18\n\nThe advanced very high-resolution radiom-\n\neter target image from Fig. 7.17 with the\n\nmaximum cross-correlation displacement\n\nvectors in cloud-free regions.\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION 587\n\n\n\nIt should be remembered that the autonav routine does not require human intervention to select the\nregions where the MCC displacement vectors are calculated. The algorithm uses the cloud identifi-\ncation routines outlined above to select the cloud-free regions and then computes the displacement\nvectors. These steps are shown as demonstrations of the method, but the algorithm was designed to\noperate completely autonomously without the need for human intervention in the process.\n\nFinally, the autonav geo-registered image in Fig. 7.19 is presented. It can clearly be seen how well\nthe coastal features, the rivers and the lakes line up. In some regions thin cloud cover makes this\ncomparison difficult. Elsewhere the relatively low cloud cover in this image makes it easy to see how\naccurately autonav has geo-registered this image when compared to its original in Fig. 7.17. Lakes and\nrivers match very closely as do the many coastline features in the image. This confirmation of land\nregistration features gives one confidence that the thermal infrared patterns in the coastal ocean are\nalso well navigated in spite of the absence of ocean landmarks to confirm this accurate georegistration.\nIt will be shown later that the attitude parameters derived from the autonav applied to a single image\ncan be applied to images in other parts of the single orbit thus making it possible to accurately geo-\nlocate open ocean images with no land references.\n\nTo evaluate the accuracy of autonav applied autonomously to a series of AVHRR 1 km images the x\n(East-West) and y (North-South) offsets for a series of nine coastal images in September of 2007 were\ncomputed (Table 7.1). The average x-offset is 0.0 km and the average y-offset is ?0.4 km (West).\nThese averages are both much smaller than the 1 km resolution of the images thus confirming the\naccuracy of the autonav method even when applied autonomously.\n\nAnother way to evaluate the performance of this georegistration method is to evaluate it against\nother AVHRR georegistration techniques. The first comparison is with the NOAA archived data from\n\nFIGURE 7.19\n\nThe autonav georegistered target image from\n\nFig. 7.17. Note the alignment of map and\n\nimage features.\n\n588 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nan NOAA-11 satellite in 1991. The navigation of this image was carried out using software developed\nby NOAA\u2019s National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) and is routinely\nembedded in the level 1b satellite data available online from NOAA/NESDIS through their CLASS.\nThis navigation method has improved in recent years by updating the TIROS-N clocks more\nfrequently and including some attitude information. As it will be shown, however, the NESDIS\ngeoregistration still results in a rather large geolocation error.\n\nThe second AVHRR image navigation method is from the European Organization for the\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites Advanced ATOVS Processing Package (EUMETSATAAPP)\nsoftware, which uses attitude parameters obtained from Moreno and Melia? (1993). It should be noted\nthat although AAPP can compute latitudes and longitudes from level 1b AVHRR data, the software is\nnot capable of producing a georegistered AVHRR image. Thus, for this comparison the latitude, and\nlongitude values have had to be used, and the image has been remapped.\n\nIn Fig. 7.20 an image from the US West Coast is shown, but this time navigated with the NOAA/\nNESDIS software. At this scale misregistrations are not easy to see. To make this comparison easier\nthe small portion of the image in the white square in the upper right corner of the image that contains\nthe large Lake Tahoe has been extracted. The boundaries of this large lake demonstrate the misreg-\nistration errors of each of the three methods. First is the NOAA/NESDIS registration with about a 4 km\noffset with the EUMETSATAAP registration yielding an error of about 3 km. The autonav software is\nclearly accurate to within the 1 km native resolution of the AVHRR image (Fig. 7.21).\n\nFinally, we want to demonstrate how the attitude corrections calculated for one part of the orbit can\nbe used for a completely different part of the orbit. While land references will be used in both cases to\ndemonstrate the success of the autonav method, this success means that it is possible to use attitude\ncorrections computed over land to accurately geolocate images over the open ocean where there are no\nlandmarks to use for georeferencing. To demonstrate this effect, we will use attitude parameters\ncalculated for the US West Coast to geolocate an AVHRR image of the island of Hawaii 3 h and two\norbits later for the same satellite and AVHRR instrument.\n\nFor this comparison an AVHRR image of Hawaii is geometrically corrected, but unregistered for\nspacecraft attitude correction (Fig. 7.22).\n\nTable 7.1 Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer autonav Registration Errors\n\nSatellite Pass Identification x-Offset (km) y-Offset (km)\n\n3 September 2007, 06:34 GMT, NOAA-18 ?1 0\n3 September 2007, 10:24 GMT, NOAA-15 0 0\n\n4 September 2007, 21:20 GMT, NOAA-15 ?1 ?1\n5 September 2007, 15:34 GMT, NOAA-17 1 ?1\n6 September 2007, 15:11 GMT, NOAA-17 0 ?1\n7 September 2007, 14:48 GMT, NOAA-17 1 ?1\n8 September 2007, 02:08 GMT, NOAA-17 0 0\n\n8 September 2007, 10:07 GMT, NOAA-15 0 0\n\n9 September 2007, 07:13 GMT, NOAA-18 0 0\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION 589\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that the geolocation is off by more than 4e5 pixels in this 1 km resolution image.\nThis is particularly evident on the Southeast shore of the Big Island, which shows the highly reflective\nland offset from the map coastline. Using the attitude parameters calculated from an image of USWest\nCoast 3 h and two orbits earlier the geolocation accuracy demonstrated in Fig. 7.23 can be achieved.\n\nWhile there are still some small misregistration errors, most of the problems in Fig. 7.22 have been\ncorrected. This again, means that we can use attitude parameters computed for one part of the orbit that\ncontains landmarks to georegister images that are over the open ocean where no landmarks exist to\ngeolocate the image data.\n\nFIGURE 7.20\n\nA NOAA-18 channel four AVHRR image geo-registered with NOAA/NESDIS attitude-corrected level 1b data.\n\nThe small white square in the upper right center will be used to compare geolocation software.\n\nFIGURE 7.21\n\nLake Tahoe navigated with: NOAA/NESDIS software (left), EUMETSAT AAPP (center), and autonav (right).\n\n590 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 7.22\n\nThe Big Island of Hawaii navigated\n\nusing geometric corrections without\n\nattitude corrections.\n\nFIGURE 7.23\n\nThe image in Fig. 7.22 georegistered\n\nwith attitude parameters computed\n\nfrom a US West Coast image 3 h and\n\ntwo orbits earlier for the same satellite.\n\n7.3 MAP PROJECTIONS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, AND GEORECTIFICATION 591\n\n\n\n7.4 MAP PROJECTIONS\nAmap projection is a method of representing the surface of the Earth on a two-dimensional plane. This\nis the process of creating a map of the Earth\u2019s surface all of which distort the Earth\u2019s surface in some\nway as originally proved by Gauss who said that no sphere can be represented on a plane without\ndistortion. These distortions can be minimized depending on the specific application of the map\nprojection. Because there are many different applications, there are a consequent large number of\ndifferent map projections. Only a few types will be presented here as examples, but the interested\nreader can find many volumes that are addressed to subject of map projections (e.g. Mart??n-As??n, 1990;\nKraak and Ormeling, 1996).\n\nFor simplicity it will be assumed that the Earth\u2019s surface is a sphere rather than the precise ellipsoid\nor geoid as discussed earlier. The purpose of a map projection is to specify the transformation between\nthe curved elliptical surface of the Earth and the flat planar surface of the map. One example is the\nAlbers projection shown here in Fig. 7.24.\n\nThis projection is a conic, equal area map projection that uses two standard parallels. This\nparticular projection shows areas correctly, but to do so, it alters the shapes and scales of these areas. It\nis used by the US Geological Survey and the US Census Bureau.\n\nThe most widely used map project is the \u201ctransverse Mercator\u201d, which is convenient for large-scale\nmaps as it preserves size and shape for areas within the same limited range of latitudes. The projection\ngeometry is described here in Fig. 7.25, which reveals that this is a cylindrical projection with the tangent\npoints of the cylinder at both poles. A particular \u201ctransverse Mercator\u201d projection called the Universal\nTransverse Mercator (UTM) is probably the most recommended one from latitudes 84?N to 80?S\n(Fig. 7.26A). For polar regions for latitudes North of 84?N, and South of 80?S, the Universal Polar\nStereographic (UPS) is widely used (Fig. 7.26B). Both are coordinate systems that use a metric-based\nCartesian grid laid out on a conformally projected surface. The properties of the UTM are as follows:\nit is conformal (shapes are preserved), its central meridian is automecoic (distances are preserved), the\nequator and the central meridian intersection is the origin of the (x,y) coordinates, which are expressed in\nmeters. The whole globe is \u201csliced\u201d in 60, 6? fuses, with the Greenwich meridian lying between fuses\n30 and 31. The advantage is that no point is too far away from the central meridian, so the distortions in\nthe fuse are small, but this benefit is achieved at the expense of the discontinuities.\n\nFIGURE 7.24\n\nAlbers projection of North America.\n\n592 CHAPTER 7 ORBITAL MECHANICS, IMAGE NAVIGATION, MAP PROJECTIONS\n\n\n\nThe transverse Mercator projection is mathematically the same as the standard Mercator projection\nexcept that it is oriented around a different access. The standard Mercator projection has the cylinder\noriented North-South (Fig. 7.27), which results in the familiar stretching of the meridional lines as\nhigher latitudes.\n\nOnce the choice is made between projecting on to a cylinder, a cone or a plane, the shape of the map\nfeatures must be specified. This is done by specifying how the projection surface is located relative to\nthe globe. It may be normal so that themap surface of symmetry coincides with the Earth\u2019s axis or it may\nbe transverse that is at right angles to the Earth\u2019s axis. The map surface may be tangent in just touching\nthe Earth\u2019s surface or it may be secant where the map plane intersects or \u201cslices\u201d through the globe.\n\nA sphere or globe is the only way to depict the Earth that exhibits constant scale throughout the\nentire map in all directions. A flat map cannot achieve this property for any area regardless of pro-\njection method or limited size of the area of interest. Scale depends on location on the Earth, but not on\norientation. Scale is constant along any line of parallel (latitude) in the direction of the latitude.\n\nMap projections can be classified by the type of projection surface onto which the globe is pro-\njected. Examples are cylindrical (e.g., Mercator), conical (e.g., Albers), and azimuthal or planar (e.g.,\nstereographic used frequently for polar maps). Another way to classify map projections is according to\nthe properties that they preserve such as: preserving direction (azimuthal), preserving local shape\n(conformal or orthomorphic), preserving area (equal-area), preserving distance (equidistant), and\npreserving the shortest route (gnomonic). Because a sphere cannot be flattened, it is impossible to have\na map projection that is both equal-area and conformal. There are, of course, many other mathematical\nformulations for map projections that do not fit easily into any of these classification schemes.\n\nThe National Atlas of the United States uses a Lambert azimuthal, equal-area projection to display\nthe country: it is a particular mapping from a sphere to a disk, which accurately represents area in all\nregions of the sphere, but it does not accurately represent angles. Conformal maps are used for\nnavigational or meteorological charts. The US Geological Survey uses a conformal projection for\n\nCentral meridian selected by mapmaker\ntouches cylinder if the cylinder is\ntangent.\n\nEquator\n\nCan show whole Earth, but the directions, distances,\nand areas are reasonable accurate only within\n15 degrees of the central meridian.\n\nNo straight rhumb lines.\n\nFIGURE 7.25\n\nTransverse Mercator projection.\n\n7.4 MAP PROJECTIONS 593\n\n\n\nFIGURE 7.26\n\n(A) UTM projection system: longitude zones are 6? wide, numbered from 01 at 180?
