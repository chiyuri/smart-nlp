It can\nalso be called a trajectory or an orbit for short. Generally, there are three types,\nnamely, launch orbit, operational orbit, and re-entry orbit. It follows that space orbit\ntheory is about the principles and methods that the design of a space orbit should\ncomply with, while orbit design is one of the key technologies in spacecraft system\ndesign.\n\nOrbit design needs to take many factors into consideration, such as orbit\ndynamics, space environment, mission requirement, and capability of effective\npayload, among others. Theories regarding orbit design were proposed long before\nthe first man-made satellite was launched into space.\n\nWith the growing demands in space application and the advancements in space\ntechnology, classical orbit theories and design methods can no longer meet the\nrequirements of new space missions. There is an urgent need for new space orbit\ntheories which can effectively bring advanced space technology into full play.\n\nOn the basis of decade-long research findings, this book aims to answer the call\nof these new developments. There are eight chapters in this book. The first part\nconsists of the first two chapters, which are a general review of recursive orbit,\nsynchronous orbit, frozen orbit, stay orbit, and other classical orbits, together with\ntheir design methods. Based on this review, the focus of this book, i.e., concepts,\ntypes, and applications of special space orbits are introduced. The second part is\nfrom chapter three to chapter eight. Each chapter is about a specific orbit, together\nwith its concepts, characteristics, design methods, and applications. So altogether,\nthere are six special space orbits which are elaborated, namely, hovering orbit,\nspiral cruising orbit, multi-target rendezvous orbit, initiative approaching orbit,\nresponsive orbit, and earth pole-sitter orbit.\n\nThis book is based on the findings of our research team over the years. We want\nto thank Profs. Zhi Li and Lei Wang, postgraduate students Xiaojing Xu, Yuanfei\nLi, and Haijun Zhou, for their contributions to this book.\n\nTheories of space orbit design are closely related to other fast-changing areas of\nstudy and develop along with new space applications. The authors are fully aware\n\nv\n\n\n\nof the limitations of this book and warmly welcome comments in order to improve\ntheir work.\n\nThis book can be used as a technical reference for people engaged in the\nstrategic studies of space development and engineering applications. It can also be\nused as a textbook for students majoring in space sciences and technologies.\n\nBeijing, China Yasheng Zhang\nJanuary 2014\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview of Classical

Contents\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe book focuses on the theory and design method of special space orbit. With the\ndevelopment human need and the progress in space technique, the classical orbit\ntheory and design method cannot satisfy the new needs anymore. In this book, the\nconcept of special space orbit is put forward, theory and design methods of\nhovering orbit, spiral cruising orbit, multi-target rendezvous orbit, initiative\napproaching orbit are expatiated; also, responsive orbit and polar stay is introduced\nsimply.\n\nHopefully, it would be useful for engineers and scientists working in related\nfields.\n\nxi\n\n\n\nChapter 1\nOverview of Classical Orbits\n\nThe operation orbit of a spacecraft directly determines the observational geometry\nand operating environment of a space mission, and largely determines the payload\nperformance of a spacecraft. Ever since the successful launch of the first artificial\nsatellite in 1957, humankind has spared no effort in exploring the relationship\nbetween space missions and spacecraft orbits. Concepts such as recursive orbit,\nsun-synchronous orbit, frozen orbit, stay orbit, and others, have been successively\nbrought forward and applied in communication, navigation, reconnaissance,\nmeteorological exploration and other space missions. These orbits, with their\nunique advantages and application having been tested in various space missions and\nwidely acknowledged around the globe, are generally known as classical orbits.\n\nIn this chapter, the concepts, characteristics and applications of four classical\norbits, i.e., recursive orbit, sun-synchronous orbit, frozen orbit and stay orbit, will\nbe introduced briefly.\n\n1.1 Recursive Orbit\n\nAmong the many different kinds of spacecraft, reconnaissance and remote sensing\nsatellites and missile early-warning satellites are responsible for the detection and\nearly warning of hot spots, while communication satellites are required to provide\ncommunication support for other particular areas. All these determine that the\nrecursive orbit is the most commonly adopted orbit in space missions.\n\nThe geosynchronous orbit, as a unique type of recursive orbit, is subject to\nstricter constraint conditions. Within each regression period, satellites travelling in\nthe recursive orbit pass all of its coverage areas in sequence, dynamically moni-\ntoring these areas and capturing any changes to the targets within the period.\n\n\u00a9 National Defense Industry Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017\nY. Zhang et al., Theory and Design Methods of Special Space Orbits,\nDOI 10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6_1\n\n1\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Recursive Orbit: Definition\n\nRecursive orbit refers to the spacecraft orbit with periodically-repeated ground\ntracks. The time interval of the said repetition is called a regression period, and the\ntime a spacecraft spends on travelling one lap along the orbit is called an orbital\nperiod.\n\nThe precession resulted from the earth\u2019s rotation and the perturbation of its orbit\nplane keeps a spacecraft\u2019s orbit plane rotating relative to a specific longitude line on\nthe Earth. Specifically speaking, a precession angular velocity of the spacecraft\u2019s\norbit plane relative to the Earth, ~xe, is generated because of the earth\u2019s rotation.\nAnd the impact of the earth\u2019s perturbation, especially the earth\u2019s non-spherical\n\nperturbation, results in _~X; a precession angular velocity of the spacecraft\u2019s orbit\nplane relative to the Earth. Hence, by adding the two precession angular velocities,\n\ni.e., ~xe \u00fe _~X; the angular rate of the spacecraft\u2019s orbit plane relative to the Earth can\nbe obtained. The time interval, during which an orbit plane completes one rotation\nrelative to a particular longitude line on the Earth, can be calculated and obtained by\nEq. (1.1):\n\nTe \u00bc 2p\n~xe \u00fe _~X\n??? ??? \u00f01:1\u00de\n\nIt takes the Earth one sidereal day to complete one rotation, i.e., to rotate 360\u00b0.\nWe can denote a spacecraft orbital period as T, if there are two relatively prime\npositive integers D and N that satisfy:\n\nNT \u00bc DTe \u00f01:2\u00de\n\nThen the ground tracks, which start to overlap after the spacecraft travels N laps\nin D days, is defined as a recursive orbit. N is the minimum number of laps and D\nthe minimum numbers of days required for the repetition of ground tracks to take\nplace. If D = 1, then the ground tracks repeat day by day, and their serial numbers\nare arranged from east to west. Within each day, the equator is equally divided by\nthe ascending and descending of orbits respectively. Figure 1.1 demonstrates a\ntypical division of the equator. If D > 1, then the ground tracks repeat every D days\ninstead of every day.\n\n1.1.2 Different Orbital Periods\n\nUnder the influences of different perturbations, a spacecraft orbit changes con-\nstantly. The period of the corresponding osculating orbit, similarly, changes with\ntime. The period of a spacecraft\u2019s osculating orbit determined at any time is defined\n\n2 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\nas an osculating period, a time interval that cannot be measured directly. Hence,\nother two measurable periods, i.e., the nodal period and the perigee period, are more\nfrequently used in real work. Their definitions are as follows:\n\nNodal period is the time interval it takes a satellite to travel across the ascending\nnodes twice successively.\nPerigee period refers to the time interval it takes a satellite to travel across the\nperigees twice successively.\n\nIf we do not take the influence of perturbation into consideration, the osculating\norbit overlaps with the actual orbit and the osculating period, nodal period and\nperigee period, which can be calculated and obtained by Eq. (1.3), are equivalent:\n\nT \u00bc 2p\nffiffiffiffiffi\na3\n\nl\n\ns\n\u00f01:3\u00de\n\nNevertheless, when perturbation is taken into account, the three periods vary\nfrom each other.\n\nSpecifically speaking, the integral expression of a nodal period is:\n\nTX \u00bc\nZ2p\n0\n\ndt\ndu\n\n? ?\ndu \u00f01:4\u00de\n\nHere, u represents the argument of latitude, or the argument of the ascending\nnode. When only J2-perturbation is taken into account, Eq. (1.4) can be expanded\nand transformed until O J2e2\u00f0 \u00de exists in the expression. The transformation equation\nbetween a nodal period and an osculating period can then be expressed as:\n\nFig. 1.1 Order of ground tracks when N/D = 4\n\n1.1 Recursive Orbit 3\n\n\n\nTX \u00bc T0 1? 3J28a2 12\u00fe 34e\n2? ?? 10\u00fe 20e2? ? sin2 i?\t\n\n? 4? 20 sin2 i? ?e cosx\u00fe 18? 15 sin2 i? ?e2 cos 2x\n? \u00f01:5\u00de\n\nHere, T0 stands for the osculating period, and a, e, i and x are the osculating\norbit elements of a spacecraft when u \u00bc 0 (i.e., at the ascending node).\n\nThe perigee period can be expressed as:\n\nTx \u00bc\nZ2p\n0\n\ndt\ndM\n\n? ?\ndM \u00f01:6\u00de\n\nHere, M represents the mean anomaly. When only J2-perturbation is taken into\naccount, Eq. (1.6) can be expanded and transformed until O J2e2\u00f0 \u00de exists in the\nexpression.

Its orbital period is one day\nand its regression period is also one day. As a circular orbit, the GEO has an orbit\naltitude of 35,786 km and an orbit inclination of 0\u00b0. A satellite that travels on the\nGEO is stationary relative to the surface of the Earth. That is to say, a GEO satellite\nis fixed to a certain location above the earth\u2019s equator, as shown in Fig. 1.2.\n\nHowever, a GEO satellite is by no means fixed in space as it is actually travelling\nat a speed of 3.07 km per second. It appears stationary relative to the earth\u2019s surface\nsimply because it shares the same rotational angular rate and direction with the\nEarth when it rotates around the earth\u2019s axis. Theoretically speaking, there is only\none GEO, on which many satellites are distributed above the equators at different\nlongitudes. The fixed location of each GEO satellite is the geographic longitude at\nthe very moment when the satellite enters the GEO. A high precision is required for\nthe positioning of the GEO since the satellite may drift even if there is only a minor\nerror. If the satellite drifts northward or southward, the orbit inclination will no\nlonger be 0\u00b0, and the orbit plane will stop overlapping with the equatorial plane. In\n\n4 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\nthis case, the satellite moves along the latitude direction once every day and the\nground tracks form a shape of \u201c8\u201d, pointing to the north and the south.\n\nOne GEO satellite can cover approximately 40 % of the earth\u2019s surface.\nTherefore, three satellites, distributed equidistantly along the equator, can achieve a\nglobal coverage of the earth\u2019s surface, excluding the polar regions. As GEO\nsatellites are relatively stationary, the antennas of ground stations can easily trace\nthem, making the GEO more preferable for communication satellites, broadcast\nsatellites and meteorological satellites.\n\nGEO is the most widely used type of orbit so far. However, we need to consider\nthe strict restrictions and safety factors of GEO satellites in normal operating con-\nditions. For controlled satellites, it is required by the Radio Regulations that the\nposition-keeping precision of GEO satellites should not be larger than \u00b11\u00b0, indi-\ncating that the orbital separation between two satellites should be kept larger than 2\u00b0.\n\nIn 1979, the Radio Regulations further ruled that the drift should be kept no\nlarger than \u00b10.1\u00b0. Thanks to the advancement in space technology, GEO satellites\ncan now be deployed at an even smaller longitude separation. Figure 1.3 demon-\nstrates the spatial distribution of GEO controlled satellites up to December, 2012,\noffered by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n\n1.2 Sun-Synchronous Orbit\n\nAs its name implies, a sun-synchronous orbit is closely related to the Sun. The\nwell-known resources satellites, meteorological satellites, ocean satellites and so on,\nincluding the American IKONOS satellite and the French Helios reconnaissance\nsatellite, all adopt sun-synchronous orbits.\n\nFig. 1.2 Ground tracks and coverage area of GEO\n\n1.1 Recursive Orbit 5\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Sun-Synchronous Orbit: Definition\n\nA sun-synchronous orbit refers to the orbit in which the precession angular velocity\nof the spacecraft\u2019s orbit plane is equal to the angular velocity of the mean Sun when\nit moves along the equator.\n\nInfluenced by the non-spherical perturbation of the Earth, the spacecraft\u2019s orbit\nplane keeps a procession angular velocity of _X: If only the long-term J2-pertur-\nbation is taken into account, _X can be expressed by Eq. (1.8):\n\n_X \u00bc ? 9:97\u00f01? e2\u00de2\nRe\na\n\n? ?3:5\ncos i\u00f0?=d\u00de \u00f01:8\u00de\n\nA tropical year is defined as the time interval it takes for the mean Sun to move\nacross the vernal equinox twice successively during its apparent annual motion\nalong the equator. And it is equal to 365.2422 mean solar days. Hence, the angular\nvelocity of the mean Sun moving along the equator is:\n\n360\n365:2422\n\n\u00bc 0:9856?=d\n\nFig. 1.3 Spatial distribution of GEO spacecraft (Controlled satellites) (Classification of\nGeosynchronous objects, issue 15 [R]. European Space Agency, European Space Operations\nCenter 2013.)\n\n6 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\nIn accordance with its definition, the sun-synchronous orbit can be described as:\n\n? 9:97\u00f01? e2\u00de2\nRe\na\n\n? ?3:5\ncos i \u00bc 0:9856 \u00f01:9\u00de\n\nIf the orbital eccentricity e \u00bc 0, then the satellite orbit is a circular orbit,\nEq. (1.9) can be further transformed and simplified into:\n\n?9:97 Re\na\n\n? ?3:5\ncos i \u00bc 0:9856 \u00f01:10\u00de\n\nThe relation between the semi-major axis of a sun-synchronous circular orbit and\nthe orbit inclination can thus be obtained. It is manifest that the orbit inclination of a\nsun-synchronous orbit is always larger than 90\u00b0.\n\n1.2.2 Sun-Synchronous Orbit: Characteristics\n\nThe spacecraft on the sun-synchronous orbit always have a constant local mean\nsolar time, or the sun elevation angle when they travel past areas with the same\nlatitude from the same direction. This feature of the sun-synchronous orbit makes it\na favorable choice for sun-related satellites. For instance, by adopting the\nsun-synchronous orbit, a visible reconnaissance satellite receives preferable illu-\nmination conditions and achieves better optical reconnaissance results when it\npasses specific target areas during each ascending or descending movements.\n\nThe included angle between the direction of the Sun and the local horizontal\nplane of a sub-satellite point is called the Sun elevation angle. If we suppose the\ndistance between the Sun and the Earth is infinite, then the sunlight can be con-\nsidered as parallel light. In Fig. 1.4, S, Oe and p are the sub-satellite point, the Earth\ncenter-of-mass (CM), and the local horizontal plane in which the sub-satellite point\nlocates respectively.\n\nWe can denote the sun elevation angle of a sub-satellite point as hH according to\nits definition. As the sunlight is parallel, the incident angle of any spot in plane p\nremains the same. Hence,\n\nhH \u00bc a \u00bc p2 ?W \u00f01:11\u00de\n\nIn accordance with the equation of spherical triangle, Eq. (1.12) can be obtained:\n\nsinhH \u00bc cosW \u00bc sin d sin dH \u00fe cos d cos dH cos\u00f0aH ? a\u00de \u00f01:12\u00de\n\nGiven that the mean Sun moves in the equatorial plane, i.e., dH \u00bc 0, Eq. (1.12)\ncan be transformed into\n\n1.2 Sun-Synchronous Orbit 7\n\n\n\nsinhH \u00bc cos d cos\u00f0aH ? a\u00de \u00f01:13\u00de\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 1.5, a spacecraft travels in the orbit for a complete cycle T. It\ndescends and travels across the same circle of latitude twice consecutively, the two\ndescending nodes of which are denoted as S1 and S2. The corresponding ascending\nnodes at which the spacecraft crosses are denoted as N1 and N2, and the corre-\nsponding locations of the mean Sun as H1 and H2.\n\nIn accordance with the equation of spherical triangle, the right ascensions of S1\nand S2, i.e., a1 and a2, can be determined by the orbit inclination and the local\nlatitude, i.e.,\n\nFig. 1.4 Sun elevation angle\n\nFig. 1.5 Satellite travelling\npast areas with the same\nlatitude from the same\ndirection\n\n8 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\na1 ? aN1 \u00bc a sin cos icos d\n? ?\n\n\u00f01:14\u00de\n\na2 ? aN2 \u00bc a sin cos icos d\n? ?\n\n\u00f01:15\u00de\n\nHere, aN1 and aN2 stand for the right ascensions of N1 and N2 respectively.\nFormula (1.15) minus (1.14) is Eq. (1.6).\n\na2 ? a1 \u00bc aN1 ? aN2 \u00f01:16\u00de\n\nIn accordance with the definition of the sun-synchronous orbit,\n\naN1 ? aN2 \u00bc aH2 ? aH1 \u00f01:17\u00de\n\nHere, aH2 and aH1 are the corresponding right ascensions of H1 and H2\nrespectively. Hence,\n\nhH1 \u00bc hH2 \u00f01:18\u00de\n\n1.2.3 Sun-Synchronous Regression Orbit and Its\nApplications\n\nThe design of a sun-synchronous orbit usually involves two steps. The first step is\nto design the orbit altitude, or the semi-major axis for a circular orbit, which\ndepends on the demands of the satellite\u2019s overall design for coverage, resolution\nand coverage period. Once the orbit altitude is determined, the orbit inclination can\nbe confirmed. The second step is to design the right ascension of ascending node\n(RAAN), or to decide the proper launch time, satisfying the demands for the\nrelative location of the satellite orbit and the Sun. For a sun-synchronous orbit,\nsatisfying the demand for the sun elevation angle is the first priority.\n\nIn practical application, the sun-synchronous regression orbit, which is a com-\nbination of the sun-synchronous regression orbit and the recursive orbit, is more\nfrequently adopted. The design of a sun-synchronous regression orbit involves the\nfollowing three procedures:\n\n(1) Determine the orbital period that satisfies certain regressive conditions, i.e.,\nT = D mean Sun day/N. Here, N refers to the number of laps the satellite\ntravels in D mean Sun days;\n\n(2) Calculate the semi-major axis of the orbit according to the orbital period\nFormula, Eq. (1.3);\n\n(3) Determine the orbit inclination in accordance with Eq. (1.10), i.e., the con-\nstraint conditions of a sun-synchronous orbit.\n\n1.2 Sun-Synchronous Orbit 9\n\n\n\n1.3 Frozen Orbit\n\nA frozen orbit is also known as apsidal line frozen orbit. Like the sun-synchronous\norbit, it has many valuable properties. For instance, the shape of a frozen orbit, its\n90\u00b0 perigee argument, and the altitude of spacecraft when it travels above areas with\nthe same latitude from the same direction all maintain unchanged. These properties\nprovide favorable conditions for ground inspection and the scientific measurement\nof the vertical section.\n\n1.3.1 Frozen Orbit: Definition\n\nThe non-spherical perturbation of the Earth results in the rotation of a space orbit\nplane in inertial space, i.e., the precession of the orbit plane and the rotation of the\napsidal line. A frozen orbit refers to the orbit whose semi-major axis, or the apsidal\nline, consistently points in the same direction. In other words, frozen orbits are\norbits with constant eccentricity and perigee argument. Therefore, this kind of orbit\ncan be described as follows:\n\ndx\ndt\n\n\u00bc 0\nde\ndt\n\n\u00bc 0\n\n8><\n>: \u00f01:19\u00de\n\nIf only the long-term J2-perturbation is taken into account, then Eq. (1.19) can\nbe expressed as:\n\ndx\ndt\n\n\u00bc 3nJ2a\n2\nE\n\na2\u00f01? e2\u00de2 1?\n5\n4\nsin2 i\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 0\n\nde\ndt\n\n\u00bc 0\n\n8>><\n>>: \u00f01:20\u00de\n\nHere, n, aE, a, e, and i refer to the mean angular rate of the orbit, semi-major axis\nof the Earth, semi-major axis of the orbit, eccentricity, and orbit inclination\nrespectively.\n\nWhen we suppose that the apsidal line does not rotate, it can be gained from the\nfirst equation of Eq. (1.20) that\n\n10 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\ni \u00bc 63:4? or 116:4?\n\nHere, orbit inclinations of 63.4\u00b0 and 116.4\u00b0 are called critical inclinations.\nIf J2 and J3 perturbations are taken into account, then it is required that:\n\ndx\ndt \u00bc\n\n3nJ2a2E\na2\u00f01?e2\u00de2 1? 54 sin\n\n2 i\n? ?\n\n1\u00fe J3aE2J2a\u00f01?e2\u00de\n\u00f0sin2 i?e cos 2i\u00de sinx\n\ne sin i\n\nh i\n\u00bc 0\n\nde\ndt \u00bc\n\n?3na3EJ3 sin i\n2a3\u00f01?e2\u00de2 1? 54 sin\n\n2 i\n? ?\n\ncosx\u00bc 0\n\n8<\n: \u00f01:21\u00de\n\nIt can be gained by solving Eq. (1.12) that when i = 63.4\u00b0 or i = 116.4\u00b0, the\nrequirements for a frozen orbit are still met. In addition, if x = 90\u00b0 and x = 270\u00b0,\nthen de=dt \u00bc 0. The rotation of the apsidal line can also be stopped if i satisfies:\n\n1\u00fe J3aE\n2J2a\u00f01? e2\u00de\n\nsin2 i? e cos 2i\ne sin i\n\n\u00bc 0 \u00f01:22\u00de\n\nFigure 1.6 illustrates the relationship between the eccentricity, the orbit altitude,\nand the orbit inclination of a frozen orbit.\n\nThe computational accuracy of a frozen orbit, which is actually the product of\nzonal harmonics\u2019 balance, depends on the order of the zonal harmonic. The larger\nthe order is, the more precise the calculation is and the more computational effort it\ntakes. Generally speaking, only J2 and J3 should be considered when the orbit\ninclination is smaller than 50\u00b0. Zonal harmonics higher than J3 should be taken into\naccount when the orbit inclination is larger than 50\u00b0.\n\nFig. 1.6 Relationship between eccentricity, orbit altitude, and orbit inclination of a frozen orbit\n\n1.3 Frozen Orbit 11\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Molniya Orbit and Its Applications\n\nA Molniya Orbit is a highly elliptical orbit with frozen characteristics, the major\nfeature of which is the relatively long time it stays in space in the northern or\nsouthern hemisphere. The Russian Molniya (Russian: Mo????) communications\nsatellite system, a communications satellite system for both civil and military uses,\nis a typical Molniya orbit. Molniya satellites operate at an orbit altitude of\n400 km ? 40,000 km, with an orbit inclination of 63.4\u00b0 and an orbital period of\n12 h. See Fig. 1.7 for details.\n\nRussia (USSR) is located at a relatively high latitude, many areas of which\ncannot be fully covered by a GEO satellite. In comparison, the Molniya Orbit has\nits apogee positioned above the northern hemisphere. A Molniya satellite spends\naround 2/3 of its operating time per lap in the said area. Moreover, its relatively\nslow velocity relative to the movement of the earth\u2019s surface makes it easy to be\ntracked by ground stations. This is very favorable for satellite communications in\nhigh latitudes.\n\nThe Molniya communications satellites, initially launched in 1964, have now\nbeen developed for three generations. The current system in commission is of the\nthird generation, with some improved first-generation satellites still being launched\nand used simultaneously. The whole constellation consists of 8 satellites, with a 45\u00b0\nincluded angle between every two orbit planes, providing constant communication\ncoverage for high latitude areas. The first generation of the Molniya satellite was\ndeveloped with a military communication payload. This satellite weighs 1600 kg,\nwith 500\u2013700 W power and a designed life of two years, and carries more than one\n40 W military transponders. The third generation of the Molniya satellite is mainly\nused for civil communication domestically. The satellite has a weight of 1750 kg,\nwith 1200 W power and a designed life of four years, and carries three 30 W\ntraveling wave tube amplifiers, with two in use and one for back up. The uplink and\ndownlink frequencies are 5.975\u20136.225 GHz and 3.650\u20133.900 GHz respectively.\n\nFig. 1.7 Molniya satellites\n\n12 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\nThe satellite adopts C-band global beam antenna with circular polarization. Earlier\nMolniya satellites used to carry meteorological sensors, and were even responsible\nfor the U.S.-USSR presidents\u2019 hotline communications during the Cold War.\n\n1.4 Stay Orbit\n\nGenerally speaking, there are three statuses for the ground tracks of spacecraft, i.e.,\neastward movement, westward regression and stay. The so-called stay, as its name\nimplies, refers to the long-time stop over a certain area. Therefore, the stay orbits\ncan be used by missile early-warning satellites or communication satellites, and the\nkey coverage areas can be the high latitudes which are out of reach for GEOs.\n\n1.4.1 Stay Orbit: Definition\n\nWe can denote the geographic longitude of the ground track of a spacecraft as k\u00f0t\u00de,\nif points that satisfy the following conditions exist in the geographic longitude of\nthe ground track, then the orbit is called a stay orbit, and the points are called\nstaying points.\n\ndk\ndt\n\n\u00bc 0 \u00f01:23\u00de\n\nGiven the equation of the satellites\u2019 ground tracks as:\n\nk \u00bc kX \u00fe arctg\u00f0tgu cos i\u00de ? xet \u00f01:24\u00de\n\nHere, kX refers to the geographic longitude of the ascending nodes at a certain\ntime t0; u and i are the argument of the ascending node and the orbit inclination of\nthe orbit respectively; xe refers to the angular rate of earth rotation.\n\nWhen we take derivatives of Eq. (1.24) on both sides and substitute Eq. (1.23)\ninto it, the following can be obtained:\n\ndk\ndt\n\n\u00bc cos i\n1? \u00f0sin i sin u\u00de2\n\ndu\ndt\n\n? xe \u00bc 0 \u00f01:25\u00de\n\nSince\n\ndu\ndt \u00bc hr2 \u00bc\n\nffiffiffiffi\nlP\n\np\nr2 \u00bc la3\n\n? ?1\n2\u00bd1\u00fe e cos\u00f0f \u00de?2ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n\u00f01?e2\u00de3\np \u00bc 2pT \u00bd1\u00fe e cos\u00f0u?x\u00de?\n\n2ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u00f01?e2\u00de3\n\np\nxe \u00bc 2p24\n\n8<\n: \u00f01:26\u00de\n\n1.3 Frozen Orbit 13\n\n\n\nHere, T stands for the orbital period of a spacecraft, with hour as the unit of\nmeasurement; f refers to the true perigee angle; and x refers to the perigee\nargument.\n\nWhen we substitute Eq. (1.26) into Eq. (1.25), the following can be obtained:\n\ncos i\n\n1? \u00f0sin i sin u\u00de2\n\u00bd1\u00fe e cos\u00f0x\u00fe f \u00de?2ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n\u00f01? e2\u00de3\nq 2p\n\nT\n\u00bc 2p\n\n24\n\u00f01:27\u00de\n\nIf the spacecraft orbit is a circular one, i.e., e \u00bc 0, then the condition for the stay\npoints is transformed into:\n\ncos i\n\n1? \u00f0sin i sin u\u00de2 \u00bc\nT\n24\n\n\u00bc 1\nk\n) sin u \u00bc ?\u00f01? k cos i\u00de\n\n1\n2\n\nsin i\n\u00f01:28\u00de\n\nIt can be obtained by analyzing Eq. (1.28) that, if the equation is to have a\nsolution, then the following conditions have to be satisfied:\n\n0? ? i? 90?\ncos i? 1k\nsin i?\u00f01? k cos i\u00de1=2\n\n8<\n: \u00f01:29\u00de\n\nCombining the above conditions, the following can be gained:\n\ncos i?min k; 1\nk\n\n? ?\n\u00f01:30\u00de\n\nApparently, if k = 4, then the condition for the existence of stay points is\n73? ? i? 90?; if k = 1, then the condition for the existence of stay points is i? 90?;\nif k = 16, then the condition for the existence of stay points is 86:4? ? i? 90?.\n\nThe locations of the stay points on the stay orbits are:\n\ncosu \u00bc ?\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n24\nT\ncos i\n\nr\n\u00f01:31\u00de\n\nFor elliptical orbits, if the semi-major axis of orbit a is relatively large, then the\norbital period T is correspondingly large and the ratio k is relatively small.\nTherefore, it is more probable that there exists a stay point. If the eccentricity e is\nrelatively small, then it is more probable that there exists a stay point near the\nperigee or the apogee. If the eccentricity e is relatively large, then the stay points are\nnot likely to be discovered near the perigee when they are found near the apogee.\n\n14 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Stay Orbit: Applications\n\nThe spacecraft travelling in the stay orbits can stay for a long time near the stay\npoints, enabling the spacecraft to conduct itinerating observation of a certain lon-\ngitude line or latitude line of the Earth.\n\nIn fact, the GEO and Molniya orbit introduced earlier in this chapter both belong\nto a unique type of the stay orbits. We can denote the orbit altitude of a Molniya\nsatellite as 39,850.5 km ? 500 km and the orbit inclination as 63.4\u00b0, then the stay\npoint is located at 89\u00b0E. The ground tracks of the satellite are shown in Fig. 1.8.\n\nThe longitudes of the satellite\u2019s ground tracks change with time during one\norbital period, as shown in Fig. 1.9. It is manifest from the figure that the satellite\ncan conduct long-term itinerating observation at the 89\u00b0E longitude.\n\nThe orbital period of the said stay orbits is 12 h. We can denote that the\nspacecraft is a communications satellite which demands a minimum elevation of\n15\u00b0 for communication requirements, correspondingly then the satellite can provide\nRussia (the red area in Fig. 1.8) with as long as 11 h of communication services\nwithin each orbital period, as shown in Fig. 1.10.\n\nSince the GEO cannot cover high latitude areas, it is difficult to achieve constant\ncoverage of the said areas. Generally speaking, a constellation consisting of several\nsatellites are required for this mission. Nevertheless, the use of a stay orbit makes it\n\nFig. 1.8 Ground tracks and stay point of Molniya satellite\n\n1.4 Stay Orbit 15\n\n\n\npossible for a single satellite to hover over the high latitudes for a long time,\neffectively reducing the number of satellites needed. Hence, the stay orbits are\nhighly valuable for countries located in this area.\n\nFig. 1.9 Variation curve of the longitudes of the stay orbit\u2019s ground tracks as time changes\n\nFig. 1.10 Valid service time of communication satellite for Russia\n\n16 1 Overview of Classical Orbits\n\n\n\n1.5 Summary\n\nTested by years of astronautical practices, the application value and practicability of\nthe typical orbits have been widely recognized. Currently, the majority of the\nsatellites used for earth observation, communications, navigation, and others, still\nadopt these orbits.\n\nActually, the typical orbits introduced in this chapter are mainly orbits that rotate\naround the Earth and regard the Earth as their references. Orbits that are beyond the\nEarth\u2019s gravitational field and used to conduct lunar exploration, interplanetary\nexploration or even galaxy exploration, as well as orbit formations that regard\nspacecraft operating in the space as references, are not included in this book.\nNevertheless, these orbits have also developed maturely, with systematic orbit\ntheories and design methods. Readers interested in them may refer to relative papers\nand books for more information.\n\n1.5 Summary 17\n\n\n\nChapter 2\nSpecial Space Orbit: Concept\nand Application\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, mankind has been carrying out various\nspace activities, especially new types of space missions such as space-based space\ntarget surveillance, on-orbit service, and so on. These activities have brought about\nincreasingly higher requirements for orbits with special space motion characteris-\ntics. However, traditional orbit theories and design methods can no longer satisfy\nthese special application demands. Therefore, in this chapter, the concepts and\ncharacteristics of a special space orbit will be introduced and analyzed, with six\ntypical special space orbits elaborated in accordance with their specific application\nrequirements.\n\n2.1 Special Space Orbit: Concept\n\nA spacecraft orbit refers to the motion trajectory of the centroid of an operating\nspacecraft. In the light of different flight missions, orbits can be generally classified\ninto three categories, i.e., the artificial earth satellite trajectory, the Earth-to-Moon\nflight trajectory and the interplanetary flight trajectory. Typical orbits are usually\nKeplerian ones, which satisfy the fundamental motion equations of the restricted\ntwo body problem. Taking advantage of the typical orbit equations, such as the\nabove fundamental motion equations and the Kepler Equation, these orbits can be\nprecisely predicted.\n\nr \u00bc a\u00f01? e\n2\u00de\n\n1\u00fe e cos f \u00f02:1\u00de\n\nHere, a, e, r and f refer to the semi-major axis, the eccentricity, the geocentric\ndistance and the true anomaly of an orbit, respectively.\n\n\u00a9 National Defense Industry Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017\nY. Zhang et al., Theory and Design Methods of Special Space Orbits,\nDOI 10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6_2\n\n19\n\n\n\nThe concept of special space orbit was put forward relative to the currently\nwidely applied typical space orbit. Compared to typical orbits, special space orbits\nhave the following unique features.\n\n2.1.1 Differences in Orbit Design Concepts\n\nWith the successful launch of the first artificial earth satellite in the 1950s, design\ntheories and methods of spacecraft orbit have been developing rapidly. The primary\nmissions of a spacecraft at that time were to conduct reconnaissance and surveil-\nlance of hotspot areas, and to provide communications and navigation support for\nthe army, the navy and the air force. Hence, the design of a spacecraft orbit at that\ntime focused mainly on the relative motion between the spacecraft and the ground\narea, and the absolute orbit design methods, which take the Earth as the reference,\nwere adopted, e.g., the sun-synchronous orbit, the recursive orbit, the stay orbit, and\nso on.\n\nIn addition, mankind has spared no efforts in exploring untapped areas in space.\nIn the 1960s, there were many lunar exploration projects with burgeoning inter-\nplanetary explorations to Venus, Mercury, Mars, and other planets. Meanwhile,\ntheories and design methods in interplanetary exploration orbits have become\nincreasingly mature. The mid and late 1990s witnessed another round of upsurge in\nlunar exploration and interplanetary exploration with well-established theories and\ndesign methods.\n\nWith the continuous development of astronautical technology and the height-\nened military status of space, the functions of spacecraft, such as providing on-orbit\nservice, conducting space-based space target surveillance and so on, have become\nthe focus of all countries. To support these missions, the concept of relative orbit,\nwhich takes spacecraft as the reference point, started to emerge. In the 1990s, the\nidea of distributed satellites led to the explicit proposal of theories and design\nmethods of a spacecraft relative motion orbit, which have matured in the last\n20 years.\n\nTo sum up, the well-developed spacecraft orbit theories and the corresponding\ntypical orbits today are shown in Table 2.1.\n\nNevertheless, there are major distinctions in the theories and design methods\nbetween special space orbits and the above typical orbits. Moreover, completely\ndifferent space orbits are required by different missions, resulting in the discrepancy\nin the theories, principles and methods when designing these special space orbits.\nFor instance, the hovering orbit is a type of relative orbit that regards the target\nspacecraft as a reference; the spiral cruising orbit is a kind of relative orbit that takes\nthe target orbit as a reference; and the non-coplanar multi-target rendezvous orbit is\na fitting orbit based on several traversing points in the rendezvous orbit plane.\nHence, it is necessary to introduce the theories and design methods of special space\norbits in combination with the specific mission requirements and orbit types.\n\n20 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Coupling of Orbit Control and Orbit Design\n\nAt the early stages of astronautical technological development, restricted by\nimmature technologies in space marching, fueling, and others, spacecraft orbit\ncontrol was cautiously applied in the following four areas:\n\n(1) Launching GEO satellites\n\nRestricted by the geographic latitudes of spacecraft launching spots, GEO\nsatellites are unlikely to be launched directly into their orbits. Generally speaking, a\nGEO satellite is usually firstly sent up into the parking orbit with an altitude of 200\u2013\n400 km. As the satellite approaches the space above the equator, the upper stage\nrocket is ignited, and the satellite breaks away from the tail stage rocket after the\nbrennschluss. The satellite enters the highly elliptical transfer orbit there, with both\nthe perigee and the apogee of the orbit above the equator. Usually, the altitudes of\nthe perigee and the apogee equal those of the orbit-insertion point and the GEO\nrespectively. At the apogee of the highly elliptical transfer orbit, the apogee engine\non the satellite is ignited, driving the satellite into the GEO ultimately (Fig. 2.1).\n\n(2) Orbit maintenance\n\nAffected by a variety of perturbations including the Earth\u2019s non-spherical per-\nturbation, atmospheric drag, lunisolar attraction, solar radiation pressure, and other\nfactors, the spacecraft eventually deviate from their originally designed orbits after\nlong-term operation. As shown in Fig. 2.2, a GEO satellite with a fixed point\nlongitude of 100\u00b0 east at a certain Epoch time experiences a longitude drift under\nthe influence of perturbation. For satellites deviated from their preset orbits, it is\nnecessary to conduct orbit maintenance to ensure that they remain in the correct\norbits. As only a limited amount of fuel can be carried by the satellites, the service\n\nTable 2.1 Well-developed spacecraft orbit theories and design methods at present\n\nInitial time Orbit theory Type of typical orbit\n\n1950s Theory and design method of\nabsolute orbit\n\nRecursive orbit\nSun-synchronous orbit\nFrozen orbit\nStay orbit\u2026\n\n1960s Theory and design method of\ninterplanetary orbit\n\nLunar probe orbit\n(Chang\u2019e Lunar probe satellite, China)\nMars probe orbit\n(Curiosity Mars Rover, U.S.)\n\u2026\n\nMid-and-late\n1990s\n\nRelative orbit design method that\ntakes spacecraft as the reference\npoint\n\nFormation flight\n(Cluster II, European space agency, ESA)\n(TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X formation\nflying satellite of synthetic aperture radar,\nGermany)\n\n2.1 Special Space Orbit: Concept 21\n\n\n\nof many spacecraft has to be terminated because of fuel exhaustion. Hence, a\nrigorous plan of satellite orbit control has to be made.\n\n(3) Earth-to-Moon flight and interplanetary exploration\n\nWe can take Earth-to-Moon flight as an example. Firstly, the lunar probe is\nlaunched into the Earth-Moon transfer orbit (or into the parking orbit first, and then\nthe orbit is maneuvered into the Earth-Moon transfer orbit). During this process,\n\nFig. 2.1 Schematic figure of the launching process of GEO satellites\n\nFig. 2.2 Longitude drift of GEO satellite within a year\n\n22 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\norbit adjustments may be required. Then, after the lunar probe enters the lunar\nsphere of influence, orbit control should be conducted to transfer the lunar probe\nfrom an Earth satellite into a lunar satellite that circles the Moon. If the lunar probe\nis designed to be recalled, then orbit control is conducted again to transfer it from\nthe lunar orbit back into the Moon-Earth transfer orbit finally bringing it back to\nEarth.\n\n(4) Space rendezvous and docking\n\nDuring the process of space rendezvous and docking, the tracking spacecraft\nexperiences a series of orbit control and also attitude control, consistently bringing\ndown the relative position and relative velocity between the tracking spacecraft and\nits target spacecraft, and meeting the initial conditions of docking in a relative\nattitude angle and angular rate. Space rendezvous and docking requires a high\nprecision in both orbit control and attitude control.\n\nIn these applications, orbit control is primarily used in the transfer between the\ninitial orbit and the target orbit. It is in essence an intermediate state, rather than the\nfinal state of an orbit. Some special space orbits, however, regard orbit control as an\nintegral part of their orbit design, i.e., the special space orbit itself is possibly a type\nof controlled orbit. For instance, the hovering orbits must be subject to the suc-\ncessive monitoring of an orbit control system, thus maintaining the relative position\nbetween the spacecraft and its target unchanged or just making relative movements\nin a minimal range during a certain period.\n\nThanks to the development of modern space marching technology, long-term,\nhighly-precise and low-thrust orbit control has become a reality. Special space\norbits are thus free from the conventional restrictions of Keplerian orbits, and are\nenabled to provide on-orbit service and meet the application requirements of new\nspace missions.\n\n2.1.3 Requirements for Special Space Application\n\nDuring the past decade or so, a large number of new-concept space application\nexperiments have been conducted at home and abroad, including the already com-\npleted Orbital Express (OE) Program, the Micro-Satellite Technology Experiment\n(MiTEx) Program, the Deep Impact Program, the X-37B space maneuvering vehicle\nprogram in the United States, the still on-going Phoenix Program, and other typical\nones. The major details of these experiments are shown in Table 2.2.\n\nIn the above space experiments, the main purpose of a spacecraft is no longer to\nprovide reconnaissance, communications, navigation and other information support\nfor the ground, rather, it is to provide flexible and various services in space,\nincluding on-orbit supply, close inspection, space interception, rapid maneuver,\ncomponent replacement in space, and so on. Apparently, these space service mis-\nsions can hardly, or never, be accomplished on the basis of the current typical\n\n2.1 Special Space Orbit: Concept 23\n\n\n\norbits. By contrast, special space orbits are exactly designed for these special space\nmissions. For example,\n\n(1) Hovering orbit: proposed for space missions in which the servicing spacecraft\nshould be kept stationary relative to the target spacecraft;\n\n(2) Cruising orbit: proposed for the space-based space target surveillance\nmissions;\n\n(3) Multi-target rendezvous orbit: proposed for space missions in which the ser-\nvicing spacecraft should conduct orbital rendezvous with several non-coplanar\nspace targets simultaneously;\n\nTable 2.2 New-concept space application experiments conducted in the U.S\n\nSpace experiments Details\n\nOrbital express (OE) program A space service operation experiment conducted by the\nU.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n(DARPA) in 2007, including four major parts:\n\n(1) Testing small space robot orbiters which can\nprovide services for satellites\n\n(2) Testing target satellites that can be upgraded and\nrepaired\n\n(3) Testing interfaces between the two satellites during\nthe process of docking\n\n(4) Operating the on-orbit satellites\n\nMicro-satellite technology\nexperiment (MiTEx) program\n\nIn December 2008, the U.S. Department of Defense\nutilized two MiTEx satellites to examine the on-orbit\nmalfunctioning missile early-warning satellite of the\ndefense support program (DSP-23)\n\nDeep impact program At Beijing time 13:2:4 on July 4, 2005, the impactor of the\ndeep impact program conducted by the U.S. National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) accurately\nhit the core of Comet Temple 1, with a diameter of less\nthan 6 km, more than 100 million kilometers away from\nthe Earth at a relative velocity of 10.2 km/s\n\nXX-37B space maneuvering\nvehicle program\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, flight experiments of the space\nmaneuvering vehicles (SMV) were carried out by the U.S.\nAir Force, aiming at developing the fuselage structure, the\non-orbit maneuver, the advanced thermal protection\nsystem, the autonomous approach and landing, and other\nkey technologies for reusable SMVs. It was also aimed at\nexploring combat concepts and the capabilities of\nunmanned spacecraft that have the capability of operating\nin space for a long period\n\nPhoenix program In October 2011, the U.S. DARPA proposed the phoenix\nprogram, hoping to disassemble the communications\nantennas from abandoned GEOs and reuse them to provide\nmore economical and sustainable space-based\ncommunications services for the U.S. Air Force. The\nprogram is predicted to conduct on-orbit demonstration\nduring the 2015\u20132016 period\n\n24 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\n(4) Initiative approaching orbit: proposed for missions that require a rapid\napproach towards a space target;\n\n(5) Responsive orbit: proposed for missions in which the global coverage period\nis longer and the access frequency of the spacecraft is higher than those of the\ntypical orbits;\n\n(6) Earth pole-sitter orbit: proposed for the continuous exploration missions of the\nEarth\u2019s North and South Poles.\n\n2.2 Types of Special Orbit\n\nIn accordance with the specific space application needs, six special space orbits will\nbe introduced in this section.\n\n2.2.1 Hovering Orbit\n\nIn the 21st century, thanks to the continuous development of space technology, a lot\nof spacecraft enter into space each year. However, under the influence of the\ncomplexity and unpredictability of the space environment, requirements for\non-orbit service have been brought forward by an ever increasing number of\nspacecraft. Generally speaking, it is a necessity that a spacecraft travelling in an\norbit should satisfy Kepler\u2019s Three Laws, resulting in many problems for on-orbit\nservice. One of the problems is how to keep the servicing spacecraft stationary,\nrelative to the target spacecraft in any orientation.\n\nHovering orbits refer to the orbits on which the servicing spacecraft is kept\nstationary, or moves within a minimal range, relative to the target satellite during a\ncertain period under the control force, as shown in Fig. 2.3.\n\nThe key to the hovering orbits is to realize the hovering of the servicing\nspacecraft at a certain point or in a certain area in the target orbital coordinate\nsystem by adopting orbit control. In this way, the station-keeping of the relative\nlocation and orientation between the servicing and the target spacecraft can be\nachieved when both spacecraft are travelling at high velocities in space, thus laying\nthe foundation for accomplishing space missions such as space maintenance,\non-orbit refueling, space-based space target surveillance, and so on.\n\n2.2.2 Cruising Orbit\n\nSpace target surveillance and space environment surveillance are the basis for all\nspace activities. However, due to the geographic restrictions and the limited\n\n2.1 Special Space Orbit: Concept 25\n\n\n\ndetection range of the ground-based space detection system, it is difficult to realize\nhigh-precision detection of a high-orbit spacecraft and certain space environmental\nelements.\n\nSince the GEO satellites are stationary relative to the Earth\u2019s surface, the\nobservation stations deployed on the ground can only observe the GEO satellites\nabove them which are within their visual range all the time. They can never observe\nthe GEO satellites stationed above the other half of the Earth. Moreover, due to the\nlong distances, it is very difficult for the ground stations to identify the high-orbit\ntargets, especially the GEO ones, even if they are detected.\n\nCurrently, it is still challenging to image space targets tens of thousands of\nkilometers away by adopting the ground-based large-scale self-adaptive optical\nsystem. In addition, the possible slow tumbling of high-orbit targets makes it even\nmore difficult to achieve fine imaging results. In fact, the current ability to identify\nhigh-orbit targets is still immature. Correspondingly, space-based and ground-based\nresearch have been simultaneously conducted abroad to tackle the problem. Aiming\nto enhance its space target surveillance capability, the U.S. has carried out a series\nof research programs on space-based space target surveillance. On September 25,\n2010, the first Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite, i.e., the Pathfinder,\nwas successfully launched at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. As the first SBSS\nsatellite, it is capable of providing preliminary space surveillance service for\nmonitoring space objects in low-Earth orbits. It is projected that a satellite con-\nstellation consisting of four SBSS satellites which is equipped with more advanced\nglobal space surveillance technology will be deployed in the next phase.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Air Force\u2019s plan, the SBSS system is a LEO (Low Earth\nOrbit) optical remote sensing satellite constellation, characterized by its strong orbit\nobservation capability, short repeated observation period, and all-weather obser-\nvation capability. It is expected that the System will substantially enhance the\n\nFig. 2.3 Schematic figure of\nhovering orbit\n\n26 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\nU.S.\u2019s ability for exploring deep space objects. Allegedly, it will enhance the U.S.\u2019s\nGEO satellite\u2019s tracking ability by 50 %, and shorten the update period of the\nU.S.\u2019s space targets catalogue information from five days to two days, therefore\nenormously boosting its Air Force\u2019s space situational awareness. The System can\ndetect and track space targets such as satellites and orbital debris, detect in time the\ntiny targets in deep space, and distinguish whether it is human factors or non-human\nfactors such as the space environment that are damaging the space system. This\nsystem prominently outperforms the ground-based space surveillance system which\ncannot monitor deep-space small objects.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has also planned to develop a space target surveillance\nsatellite that travels in an even higher orbit, i.e., the Orbit Deep Space Imager\n(ODSI). The envisaged ODSI system is a satellite constellation consisting of optical\nimaging satellites that travel in the GEO, the major function of which is to provide\nthe images of three-axis stabilized GEO satellites. The ODSI satellites will travel\ncontinuously along the GEO and take pictures of the GEO satellites, capturing their\nhigh-resolution images. The system can improve not only the ability of U.S.\u2019s space\ntarget surveillance system in monitoring high-orbit targets, but also help to acquire\nthe feature information of GEO targets and enhance its capability in identifying\nthese targets.\n\nIn addition, the various types of micro-satellites being developed by the U.S. can\nalso be used for space surveillance. The proposed schemes for the application of\nmicro-satellites in space surveillance by the U.S. military forces include:\n\n? For emergent space targets with potential hostility, other space surveillance\ndetectors are firstly used to discover, track and identify the targets. When other\nspace- and ground-based space surveillance detectors fail to obtain more\ndetailed information about the targets, micro-satellites used for space\nsurveillance (including on-orbit stay micro-satellites and promptly responsive\nand launched micro-satellites) can be sent to approach the targets, conducting\nclose observations and taking pictures at short range for more detailed feature\ndata of the targets.\n\n? As for its space assets that require special protection, the U.S. armed forces\ncan deploy micro-satellites in the neighborhood, monitoring the surrounding\nenvironment, providing early warning and distinguishing between natural\ndestruction and man-made sabotage. A typical application of the micro-\nsatellites is the U.S. MiTEx test.\n\nTo sum up, two patterns can be used by the space-based space target surveillance\nsystem to monitor the GEOs:\n\n(1) Monitoring the targets in the GEO by using spacecraft deployed in the\nmedium and low orbits;\n\n(2) Deploying the surveillance satellites around the GEO orbits and monitoring\nthe targets like a drifter.\n\n2.2 Types of Special Orbit 27\n\n\n\nIn the above two patterns, the first one is more suitable for general surveys of the\nGEO targets, allowing the cataloguing of the targets within a short time. However, as\na result of the long distance and the large relative velocity between the surveillance\nsatellite and the target spacecraft, it is difficult to acquire abundant detailed infor-\nmation about the targets and meet the demands for target identification, on-orbit\nservice, and others. In the second pattern, however, because of the short distance and\nthe small relative velocity between the surveillance satellite and the target spacecraft,\nclose observation and picture-taking of the targets are feasible. In this way, geo-\nmetrical morphology, signal features and other detailed information can be obtained.\n\nA cruising orbit is a type of relative orbit, in which the cruising spacecraft\ncruises around the target orbit in a certain pattern, conducting close observation,\nproviding on-orbit service, monitoring nearby space debris and the nearby space\nenvironment, and so on, for multiple spacecraft in the target orbit. The spiral\nflying-around orbit is shown in Fig. 2.4.\n\nCompared to ordinary satellite formation flying such as flying-behind and\nflying-around, a cruising orbit has obvious advantages in the following aspects:\nFirstly, the detection target of a cruising orbit is not limited to a single satellite.\nGiven enough time, the orbit can accomplish the detection of all the on-orbit\nspacecraft in this specific orbit. Secondly, the configuration design of the cruising\norbit enables a multi-perspective detection of the target, thus obtaining the detailed\ndescription of a specific object. Thirdly, the detectors will not stay around the same\nobject for a long time. Finally, the energy consumption required for multi-target\ndetection is low. If there is no demand for cruising velocity, then the cruising\nspacecraft can conduct a cruising and detection flight along a free trajectory, which\nconsumes almost no energy theoretically.\n\n2.2.3 Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit\n\nIn April 2007, the space refueling experiment of the U.S. Orbital Express\n(OE) Project was successfully accomplished. Successively, the Phoenix Program\n\nFig. 2.4 Spiral flying-around orbit\n\n28 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\nproposed in 2011 put on-orbit maintenance on the agenda. In accordance with the\ndemands of different space missions, spacecraft are usually deployed in different\norbit planes in space. According to the statistics of the satellite database of the\nUnion of Concerned Scientists (UCS), there were 521 LEO spacecraft as of June 1,\n2013. The distribution of the orbit inclinations of these spacecraft is shown\nin Fig. 2.5.\n\nDifferent orbit inclinations inevitably result in differing orbit planes. Changing\norbit plane consumes a lot more energy than in-plane maneuvering does. Therefore,\nit is difficult for a single servicing spacecraft to provide services for multiple target\nspacecraft travelling in different orbit planes. Taking advantage of the feature that\nany spacecraft orbit inevitably crosses a random orbit plane in space, scientists have\nproposed a coplanar multi-target orbital rendezvous method based on traversing\npoint. In this method, the traversing point of the target orbit is considered as the\norbit rendezvous point and the traversing time of the target spacecraft as the orbit\nrendezvous time. In this way, the non-coplanar orbit rendezvous problem is turned\ninto a coplanar orbit rendezvous issue. Moreover, without a restriction on the\namount of target spacecraft and orbit distribution, this method realizes, in essence,\nthe one-to-many orbit rendezvous pattern.\n\n2.2.4 Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\nAn initiative approaching orbit refers to an orbit in which a spacecraft rapidly or\nslowly approaches a cooperative or a non-cooperative target through orbit control,\nthus accomplishing rendezvous and docking, rapid detection, on-orbit service and\nother space missions. A typical initiative approaching orbit is the orbit in which the\nU.S. MiTEx (Micro-Satellite Technology Experiment) satellite initiatively\napproaches and detects the DSP-23 missile early-warning satellite.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Aerospace News on January 14, 2009, the U.S. Department\nof Defense was inspecting the on-orbit malfunctioning Defense Support Program\n(DSP)-23 missile early-warning satellite utilizing two Micro-satellites (MiTEx).\n\nFig. 2.5 Distribution of orbit\ninclinations of LEO satellites\n\n2.2 Types of Special Orbit 29\n\n\n\nThis was the first on-orbit inspection mission conducted in a geosynchronous orbit\nafter the U.S. on-orbit maintenance demonstration of the OE satellite in 2007.\n\nThe MiTEx Project is a part of the Microsatellite Demonstration Science and\nTechnology Experiment Program (MiDSTEP) jointly implemented by the Defense\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. Air Force. The pro-\nject, including MiTEx-A, MiTEx-B and three upper stage vehicles that push them\ninto a geostationary orbit, aims to determine, integrate, demonstrate and evaluate\nmicro-satellite technology relevant to GEO maneuvering. Because of the strong\npropulsion capability and long service life of the upper stage vehicles of the MiTEx\nProject, the satellites can travel to any location in the geostationary orbit, conduct\nclose-range operations, take pictures, receive all radio communications sent and\nreceived by the target satellite. They can even conduct counter operations such as\ndisabling communication networks, discharging propellant in the fuel tank of the\ntarget spacecraft, and others.\n\nThe DSP-23 satellite was launched on November 10, 2007, but lost touch with\nthe ground control station around October 8, 2008. At that time, the DSP-23\nsatellite was travelling above the equator in southern Nigeria at longitude 8.5\u00ba east.\nThen the satellite drifted eastwards along the geosynchronous orbit, in accordance\nwith the orbital mechanics law, for around a year and a half, before it reached the\nspace above Australia and then returned to the west. It did this repeatedly. From\nDecember 8 to 13, 2008, the MiTEx-A satellite approached DSP-23 from the west\ntowards the east; on December 23, 2008, the MiTEx satellite reached the DSP-23\nsatellite and established images; on January 1, 2009, the MiTEx-B satellite also\napproached the DSP-23 satellite.\n\nThis experiment demonstrated that the U.S. was already equipped with key\ncapacities in rapid orbital maneuver, space-based object measurement, on-orbit\noperation service, system comprehensive integration, and so on. The orbit in which\nthe MiTEx satellite operated during its missions is a typical initiative approaching\norbit (Fig. 2.6).\n\nFig. 2.6 Process of MiTEx satellite initiatively approaching and detecting DSP-23 satellite\n\n30 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Fast Responsive Orbit\n\nTo meet the demands of emergent space missions, the U.S. Department of Defense\nand The Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies jointly released a research\nreport entitled Military Space Systems: the Road Ahead in October 2005. The report\nput forward the development strategies for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS),\nwhich included responsive satellite, responsive carrier and other technologies.\n\nThe TacSat Program being conducted by the Office of Force Transformation\n(OFT), U.S. Department of Defense, is a typical responsive satellite project. The\nprogram involves four experimental tactical satellites, which are jointly developed\nby the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, and\nother collaborative laboratories. It aims to lay the technical foundation for the\ndevelopment of responsive mini-satellites, and demonstrate the affordability of a\nbattlefield that integrates responsive launching, test and systems to support and\nsatisfy the tactical requirements from field commanders by providing them direct\naccess to space assets. The TacSat-3 launched in June 2009 is a mini-satellite\ndeveloped by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, which is the first responsive\nsatellite that carries a mini-satellite public spacecraft and an optical payload.\n\nA responsive orbit refers to an orbit that can carry out responsive missions. Here,\n\u2018responsive time\u2019 usually means the period from the time when a mission is pro-\nposed to the time when the mission is accomplished. Giving up a number of\nimportant indicators such as global coverage, a necessary feature for common\nspacecraft orbits, and even orbit lifetime, a responsive orbit focuses on its ability to\nmake fast responses to certain space missions.\n\nThe most important characteristics of a responsive orbit are:\n\n\u2022 Fast response: The responsive time of a responsive orbit is far shorter than that\nof an ordinary orbit. For example, it takes only a couple of hours for a\nresponsive orbit to send back valid data after being launched into space;\n\n\u2022 Low cost: This orbit can be used by small vehicles;\n\u2022 Tactical application ability: It is specifically used for certain operational\n\nmissions.\n\n2.2.6 Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit\n\nAn earth pole-sitter orbit refers to an orbit that can realize long-term stay above the\nEarth\u2019s poles through orbit control. These types of orbits have two major properties.\nFirstly, an earth pole-sitter orbit can realize long-term stay above the Earth\u2019s poles.\nBy adopting the earth pole-sitter orbit, a single satellite is allowed to cover the high\nlatitude regions in the northern or southern hemisphere (including the North or the\nSouth Pole). Apparently, the cost-benefit ratio of an earth pole-sitter orbit is rather\nhigh though its security is guaranteed because of the high locations of deployment.\n\n2.2 Types of Special Orbit 31\n\n\n\nSecondly, the deployment location of the earth pole-sitter orbit is high. The distance\nfrom the earth pole-sitter orbit to the Earth\u2019s surface is about 0.01 astronomical unit\n(1 astronomical unit = 1.49597870 ? 108 km). Though this may result in a rela-\ntively low resolution in ground detection, the orbit can be used for communications\nand navigation under proper conditions.\n\n2.3 Description of Special Space Orbit\n\n2.3.1 Orbit Element\n\nGenerally speaking, a spacecraft orbit can be described with six orbit elements, i.e.,\n\n\u2022 Semi-major axis a: Half of the distance between the apogee and the perigee of\nan elliptical orbit, usually used to describe the size of an elliptical orbit.\n\n\u2022 Eccentricity e: The ratio between the focal length and the semi-major axis of an\nelliptical orbit, usually used to describe the shape of an elliptical orbit, i.e., its\nnon-circular extent;\n\n\u2022 Perigee argument x: The angle measured from the orbital ascending node to the\nperigee in the motion direction of the satellite in the orbit plane, usually used to\ndescribe the orientation of the apsidal line of an elliptical orbit in the orbit plane,\ni.e., the orientation of the perigee;\n\n\u2022 Right ascension of ascending node (RAAN) X: The angle measured anti-\nclockwise from the orientation of the vernal equinox to the orbital ascending\nnode in the equatorial plane, usually used together with the orbit inclination to\ndescribe the orientation of an elliptical orbit in space;\n\n\u2022 Orbit inclination i: The included angle between an orbit plane and the equatorial\nplane, or that between the positive normal of an orbit plane and the Earth\u2019s\nNorth Pole, usually used to describe the inclining degree of the orbit plane\nrelative to the equatorial plane;\n\n\u2022 Time of perigee passage s: The time when a spacecraft passes the perigee while\ntravelling along an elliptical orbit.\n\nUnder the postulated conditions of two-body motion, the above six orbit ele-\nments are generally constants. Nevertheless, in actual space missions, spacecraft are\nsubject to the influences of the Earth\u2019s non-spherical perturbation, atmosphere\nperturbation, solar radiation pressure perturbation, lunisolar attraction perturbation,\nand so on. These influences may result in changes to a spacecraft\u2019s orbit, i.e., the\norbit elements are no longer constants. In order to study the disturbed motion of a\nspacecraft, concepts such as the osculating orbit and the osculating orbit element\nwill be introduced.\n\nConsidering any point in the actual orbit of a spacecraft as a point in a corre-\nsponding elliptical orbit (an ideal orbit), then the elliptical orbit would be called an\nosculating orbit. The osculating orbit is tangent to the actual orbit. On the point of\n\n32 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\ntangency, the actual velocity of spacecraft equals that of the corresponding point in\nthe osculating orbit. If all the perturbations vanish from this point onwards, then the\nspacecraft will travel along the osculating orbit.\n\nOsculating orbit elements describe the corresponding orbit elements of the\nosculating orbit at a certain instant (e.g., time t). Regarding the osculating orbit\nelement of a certain time as the starting point, the precise subsequent orbit motion\nstate can be obtained through numerical integration.\n\nIn order to describe more precisely the motion of a spacecraft from a macro-\nscopic view, mean orbit elements can be adopted. The so-called mean orbit ele-\nments refer to the orbit elements without the short-period changing term.\n\nThe conversion formula between the mean orbit elements and the osculating\norbit elements is:\n\nEi \u00bc E0i \u00fe dEi\u00f0E0i\u00de; i \u00bc 1; . . .; 6 \u00f02:2\u00de\n\nHere, Ei stands for the i-th osculating orbit element, E0i refers to the i-th mean\norbit element, and dEi refers to the i-th short-period changing term of the osculating\norbit element.\n\n2.3.2 Non Singularity Orbit Elements\n\nIn many applications, the spacecraft\u2019s orbit is a nearly round one, such as those of\nthe LEO reconnaissance satellite, the GEO satellite (the orbit inclination approxi-\nmates 0), and so on. Since the orbit inclination i ? 0?, the right ascension of\nascending node (RAAN) shows some singularity; and since the eccentricity e ? 0,\nthe argument of perigee also shows some singularity. The concept of non singu-\nlarity orbit elements is thus put forward to solve these singularity problems.\n\nFor orbits with orbit inclination i ? 0? and eccentricity e ? 0, there are a number\nof definitions for non singularity orbit elements, two of which will be introduced in\nthis book. The first definition is:\n\na; h \u00bc e sin\u00f0X\u00fex\u00de; p \u00bc sin i=2\u00f0 \u00de sinX\nl \u00bc X\u00fex\u00feM; k \u00bc e cos\u00f0X\u00fex\u00de; q \u00bc sin i=2\u00f0 \u00de cosX \u00f02:3\u00de\n\nHere, a and l refer to the semi-major axis and the mean longitude respectively;\nh and k refer to the projections of the eccentricity vectors (whose numerical value\nequals the orbit eccentricity and the orientation is directed towards the perigee of\nthe orbit) in the XY planes of the Earth centered inertial coordinate system\nrespectively. When we ignore the factor 1=2, then p and q can be approximately\nregarded as the projections of the normal vector of the orbit plane into the XY planes\nof the Earth centered inertial coordinate system. If we take the factor 1=2 into\n\n2.3 Description of Special Space Orbit 33\n\n\n\naccount, then the above non singularity orbit element is allowed to be used for an\norbit with a large inclination and, in the meantime, avoids singularity when the orbit\ninclination is 90\u00b0.\n\nThe second definition of non singularity orbit element is:\n\na; h \u00bc e sin\u00f0X\u00fex\u00de; p \u00bc tg i=2\u00f0 \u00de sinX\nl \u00bc X\u00fex\u00feM; k \u00bc e cos\u00f0X\u00fex\u00de; q \u00bc tg i=2\u00f0 \u00de cosX \u00f02:4\u00de\n\nThe second definition is more suitable for perturbation calculations.\n\n2.3.3 Rectangular Coordinate Component\n\nOrbit control is regularly adopted in the design of a special space orbit. The\nequation of spacecraft motion under orbit control is usually described as:\n\n\u20ac~r \u00bc ? l\nr3\n~r\u00fe~a\u00fe~aT \u00f02:5\u00de\n\nHere, ~r, l, ~a and ~aT refer to the geocentric distance vector, the Earth\u2019s gravi-\ntational constant l \u00bc 3:986005? 1014 m3=s2\u00f0 \u00de, the perturbation acceleration, and\nthe controlling acceleration, respectively.\n\nUnder orbit control, the motion of a spacecraft can be generally described with\nrectangular components, which are either components in the Earth centered inertial\ncoordinate system or components in the relative coordinate system.\n\nIn space applications, the Earth centered inertial coordinate system usually\nadopts the Mean Equinox and Equator of J2000.0 Coordinate System, or the\nJ2000.0 Coordinate System for short. The J2000.0 Coordinate System OXIYIZI is\ndefined as a coordinate system with the geocentric as its origin O, the OXI axis\npointing towards the J2000.0 mean equinox (at bar centric dynamical time\n12:00:00.000 on January 1, 2000, corresponding to the Julian Day 2451545.0), the\nOZI axis pointing towards the J2000.0 mean equator normal, and the OYI located\nwithin the mean equator plane of the J2000.0 and determined by using the right\nhand rule (Fig. 2.7).\n\nThe relative coordinate system refers to the relative motion coordinate system\nwith reference to a certain spacecraft. Here, the origin of the relative motion system\ns-xyz is fixedly connected with the centroid of the reference spacecraft and moves\nwith it; the direction of axis x overlaps with that of the geocentric vector of the\nreference spacecraft, pointing from the geocentric to s; axis y is perpendicular to\naxis x within the orbit plane of the reference spacecraft and directs towards the\nmotion direction; axis z is determined by using the right hand rule (Fig. 2.8).\n\n34 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\n2.4 Summary\n\nSpecial space orbits are proposed amid the development of space technology and\nthe expansion of fields involving space missions. Compared to the more familiar\ntypical orbits, special space orbits mainly demonstrate their distinctive features in\norbit design concepts, orbit control application, special space application demands,\nand so on.\n\nIn this chapter, the concept of a special space orbit is introduced, and then the\ncharacteristics and applications of six special space orbits, i.e., hovering orbit, spiral\ncruising orbit, multi-target rendezvous orbit, initiative approaching orbit, responsive\n\nIX\n\nIZ\n\nIY\n\nO\n\nMean equator\n\nMean equinox\n\nMean equator normal\n\nEarth center\n\nFig. 2.7 J2000.0 Earth centered inertial coordinate system\n\nFig. 2.8 Relative motion coordinate system\n\n2.4 Summary 35\n\n\n\norbit, and earth pole-sitter orbit, are briefly illustrated. Finally, three descriptive\napproaches of special space orbits including orbit element, non singularity orbit\nelement and rectangular coordinate component are discussed. In the following\nchapters, we will elaborate on the design concepts and methods of the above six\nspecial space orbits.\n\n36 2 Special Space Orbit: Concept and Application\n\n\n\nChapter 3\nTheory and Design Method\nof Hovering Orbit\n\nA hovering orbit is the relative motion orbit of a hovering spacecraft which holds\nstill or moves in a minimal range towards its target spacecraft. There are broad\napplication prospects for hovering orbits in missions like space-based space target\nsurveillance, on-orbit service and space rescue.\n\n3.1 Hovering Orbit: Concept\n\nAs the name implies, the word \u201chovering\u201d indicates that the relative position of a\nhovering spacecraft to its target spacecraft remains still in space. Essentially, a\nhovering orbit is the orbit of a hovering spacecraft which holds still or moves in a\nminimal range to its target spacecraft in the orbital coordinate system of the target\nspacecraft. The value of the relative position is a constant (depending on the specific\nmission), and the relative velocity and the relative acceleration velocity are both 0.\nThat is to say, the hovering spacecraft remains \u201crelatively static\u201d in relation to its\ntarget spacecraft. Based on the dynamics principle of spacecraft orbits, to keep the\nhovering spacecraft maintaining \u201crelative hovering\u201d to its target satellite in a period\nof time, an active control force and a control torque should be imposed on the\nhovering spacecraft.\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 3.1, T represents the target spacecraft, and S represents the\nhovering spacecraft. In the orbital coordinate system of the target spacecraft\nT ? xyz, the location parameters of the hovering spacecraft to its target spacecraft\ncan be expressed as r; a; b. Here: r represents the relative distance between the\nhovering spacecraft and the target spacecraft and is known as the hovering distance;\na represents the included angle between the projection of the hovering distance in\nthe target spacecraft\u2019s orbit plane and the motion direction of the target spacecraft,\ncalled the hovering azimuth; b represents the included angle between the hovering\ndistance and the orbit plane of the target spacecraft, called the hovering altitude\nangle or the hovering elevation angle. So, the hovering mission of a hovering\n\n\u00a9 National Defense Industry Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017\nY. Zhang et al., Theory and Design Methods of Special Space Orbits,\nDOI 10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6_3\n\n37\n\n\n\nspacecraft to a target spacecraft can be described as follows: in the hovering process\nof a hovering spacecraft to its target spacecraft, by imposing active controls to the\nspacecraft, it keeps the hovering distance r, hovering azimuth a and hovering\nelevation angle b between the spacecraft and its target spacecraft unchanged.\n\nWhen a\\0?, the hovering spacecraft is below the target spacecraft, and when\na[ 0?, the hovering spacecraft is above the target spacecraft; when b\\ 0?, the\nspacecraft is on the right side of the target spacecraft, and when b[ 0?, the\nspacecraft is on the left side of the target spacecraft. a; b in Fig. 3.1 are positive\nvalues. When a \u00bc ?90?; b \u00bc 0?, the hovering spacecraft S is directly below the\ntarget spacecraft T; and when b \u00bc 0?, the hovering spacecraft and the target\nspacecraft are in the same orbit plane. In the ideal hovering process, not only the\nrelative distance between the hovering spacecraft and the target spacecraft remains\nconstant, but also the distance d between the hovering spacecraft and the orbit plane\nof the target spacecraft keeps unchanged. The trajectory plane of the hovering\nspacecraft does not pass the Earth-center (except when coplanar hovering), and is\nparallel to the orbit plane of the target spacecraft.\n\n3.2 Design of Fixed-Point Hovering Orbit\n\nFixed-point hovering is utilized to maintain a hovering spacecraft at a point in the\norbital coordinate system of its target satellite and keep its relative position to the\ntarget satellite unchanged. Fixed-point hovering is applicable to on-orbit services\nand spatial operations which require high accuracy in directivity. Typical operations\ninclude spatial rendezvous and docking, on-orbit refueling and on-orbit mainte-\nnance. The spatial operations above require high precision on hovering spacecraft\ncontrol and usually adopt the method of continuous control.\n\nEO\n\nEX\n\nEY\n\nEZ\n\nT\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\n? ?\n\nS\n\nr d\n\nFig. 3.1 Illustration of\nconfiguration relation of\nhovering orbits\u2019 relative\nposition\n\n38 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Dynamic Model\n\nIn a two-body problem, the velocity V of a spacecraft can be expressed as:\n\nV2 \u00bc l 2\nr\n? 1\na\n\n? ?\n\u00f03:1\u00de\n\nHere: r represents the position vector of the spacecraft; a represents the\nsemi-major axis of the orbit; G represents the universal gravitation constant; mE\nrepresents the mass of the Earth; mS represents the mass of the spacecraft, and\nl \u00bc G\u00f0mE \u00femS\u00de ? GmE. Then the horizontal angular velocity of the spacecraft -\ncan be expressed as:\n\n- \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nl\nr2\n\n2\nr\n? 1\na\n\n? ?s\n\u00f03:2\u00de\n\nThus it can be seen that once the orbit is determined, or in other words, the\nsemi-major axis a is determined, the velocity of the spacecraft is only related to the\nposition vector r.\n\nThe hovering spacecraft and the target satellite have the same orbital shape,\nspatial position and dimensional orientation, except their sizes of orbits. That is to\nsay, among the six orbital elements, the eccentricity e, orbit inclination i, right\nascension of ascending node (RAAN) X, perigee argument x and true anomaly\nf are all the same, except the semi-major axis a.\n\nFrom the orbit equation:\n\nr \u00bc a\u00f01? e\n2\u00de\n\n1\u00fe e cos f \u00f03:3\u00de\n\nthe following can be obtained:\n\nr\na\n\u00bc \u00f01? e\n\n2\u00de\n1\u00fe e cos f\n\nLet g \u00bc \u00f01?e2\u00de1\u00fe e cos f , then:\n\n- \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nl\nr3\n\u00f02? g\u00de\n\nr\n\u00f03:4\u00de\n\nThat is to say, when the eccentricity e and the true anomaly f of two spacecraft\nare the same, in other words, g are the same, then the angular velocity of the\nspacecraft is only related to the value of the position vector r. The farther it is to the\nEarth, the smaller the angular velocity will be.\n\n3.2 Design of Fixed-Point Hovering Orbit 39\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that the following two steps should be adopted to achieve the\nhovering to the target satellite:\n\nStep 1: Transfer the hovering spacecraft into the hovering orbit and satisfy the\nfollowing conditions, that is, eccentricity e, orbit inclination i, RAAN X\nand perigee argument x are the same;\n\nStep 2: To keep the angular velocities of two spacecraft with different\nsemi-major axes the same, it is necessary that, when their true anomalies\nare the same, an impulse should be imposed on the hovering spacecraft\nin order to change the initial angular velocity of the hovering spacecraft\nand make it the same as the angular velocity of the target satellite. Then a\ncontinuous thrust should be imposed to keep it in a hovering state, or to\nkeep it in synchronous operation with the target satellite.\n\nHere we assume that the hovering spacecraft has completed step 1, the next part\nwill only discuss the impulse needed to change the initial velocity of the hovering\nspacecraft and the continuous thrust to keep it hovering.\n\n3.2.1.1 Mathematical Model of the Impulse Thrust\n\nWhen the hovering spacecraft goes into orbit, its initial velocity is\n\nVS \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nl\nrS\n\u00f02? g\u00de\n\nq\n.

It can be interpreted as: the thrust\nimposed counteracts a part of earth\u2019s gravity, or \u201creduces a part of earth\u2019s mass\u201d.\nThis kind of orbit can be described as an artificial \u201csub-keplerian orbit\u201d.\n\n3.2.1.3 Feasibility Analysis\n\nBased on the mathematical model of the continuous thrust, it is known that with\nregard to two orbits with fixed semi-major axis of orbit, the direction of the thrust is\nconsistent with the direction of the spacecraft\u2019s position vector, and the thrust value\nis a function of the position vector. As the value of the position vector of an\nelliptical orbit changes over time, the orbit control engine should be able to adjust\nthe thrust in real time to achieve the hovering.\n\nWith regard to a circular orbit, the value of the position vector remains\nunchanged. So the continuous thrust needed also keeps the same and the hovering\ndistance h \u00bc rT ? rS ? rT . Therefore, Eq. (3.20) can be simplified into:\n\nA \u00bc 3lh\nr3T\n\nHere, the thrust acceleration is proportional to the hovering distance, and is\ninversely proportional to the orbit radius of the target satellite.\n\nWe assume that the mass of the hovering spacecraft is 1000 kg, the following is an\nanalysis of the hovering conducted in a circular orbit (the orbit of the target satellite).\n\nIf the hovering is conducted to a spacecraft in a low orbit (orbit altitude range\n1.5 ? 105\u20131.0 ? 106 m), the thrust acceleration needed will be relatively big.\nHowever, as the orbit of the target spacecraft is relatively low, the hovering distance\nis definitely not too far. Figure 3.2 shows the acceleration of the continuous thrust\nneeded when the following flying distance is less than 1:5? 105 m. As to the\nspacecraft in the near-circular sun-synchronous orbit, to achieve the hovering with a\ndistance of 2:0? 104 m to a target satellite with an orbit radius of 6:9? 105 m, the\nrequired continuous thrust acceleration is A \u00bc 0:067921 m/s2, and the continuous\nthrust F \u00bc 67:921 N.\n\nIf the hovering is conducted to a spacecraft in a medium orbit (orbit altitude\nrange 1.0 ? 106\u20132.0 ? 107 m), the thrust acceleration needed is shown in Fig. 3.3.\nFor example: To achieve the hovering to a navigation satellite at a distance of\n2:0? 105 m, the acceleration of continuous thrust needed is A \u00bc 0:01313 m/s2, and\nthe continuous thrust F \u00bc 13:13 N.\n\nIf the hovering is conducted to a spacecraft in a high orbit (orbit altitude: over\n2:0? 107 m), the thrust acceleration needed is shown in Fig. 3.4. For example: to\nachieve the hovering to a geostationary satellite at a distance of 2:0? 105 m, the\n\n44 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nacceleration of continuous thrust needed is A \u00bc 0:0031573 m/s2, and the continu-\nous thrust F \u00bc 3:1573 N. When the following flight distance is 1:0? 106 m, the\nacceleration of continuous thrust needed is A \u00bc 0:016095 m/s2, and the continuous\nthrust F \u00bc 16:095 N.\n\nFig. 3.2 Acceleration of continuous thrust needed to achieve hovering of low-orbit spacecraft\n\nFig. 3.3 Acceleration of continuous thrust needed to achieve hovering of medium-orbit spacecraft\n\n3.2 Design of Fixed-Point Hovering Orbit 45\n\n\n\nNext, we assume that the operation orbit or the target spacecraft is an elliptical\norbit, and its hovering process will be analyzed. It is known that the value of the\ncontinuous thrust is related to the spacecraft orbit altitude. Take the Molniya highly\nelliptical orbit satellite with an orbit period of 12 h as an example: The apogee\naltitude is about 4:0? 107 m, the perigee altitude is about 6:0? 105 m. We assume\nthe difference between the semi-major axis of the hovering orbit and that of the\ntarget satellite is 2:0? 105 m, Fig. 3.5 shows the change in the continuous thrust\nfor hovering during one orbit period. Here, when the spacecraft is at its apogee, the\nthrust acceleration needed is 0:004207m\n\n?\ns2, the value of thrust is 4:207 N; when at\n\nits perigee, the thrust acceleration needed is 0:1913 m\n?\ns2 and the value of the thrust\n\nis 191:3 N.\nFrom the above analysis, it is thus clear that for a target spaceship with a certain\n\norbit altitude, if a reasonable hovering distance is decided, it will be realizable to\nconduct hovering and provide the continuous thrust. Especially to a geostationary\nsatellite, an \u201celectric propulsion\u201d engine can help achieve this process. Here, the\noperation principle of electric propulsion is as follows: Solar energy or nuclear\nenergy transforms into electric energy through a conversion device, then the electric\nenergy heats up the propellant or ionizes the propellant to accelerate the propellant\nand form high-speed jet propulsion, which ejects out and produces thrust to boost\nthe spacecraft flying capacity. Electric propulsion engines were successfully\ndeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s and reached a relatively high technical level.\nCurrently, the number of spacecraft launched using electric propulsion exceeds 200.\nResearch on electric propulsion engines is a major trend in the development of\npropulsion technology.\n\nFig. 3.4 Acceleration of continuous thrust needed to achieve hovering of high-orbit spacecraft\n\n46 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Open-Loop Control\n\nIn the orbital coordinate system shown in Fig. 3.6, the hovering spacecraft is\nlocated at point A0 and the target spacecraft is located at point O. If we assume that\nthe difference of geocentric longitude between the sub-satellite point of point O and\nany point A on earth is a, the geocentric latitude of point A is b, then the position of\npoint A in the reference system can be described as:\n\n\u00f0xOA; yOA; zOA\u00de \u00bc \u00f0RE cos a cos b? R;RE sin a cos b;RE sin b\u00de \u00f03:22\u00de\n\nHere: R represents the geocentric distance of the target spacecraft, RE represents\nthe Earth\u2019s radius. Thus, in the coordinate system Oxyz, the unit vector of vector OA\ncan be obtained as eOA \u00bc OAjOAj.\n\nWe assume that the distance between A0 and O is L, the position of A0 in the\nreference system Oxyz is: \u00f0x; y; z\u00de \u00bc L ? eOA, the coordinate position of A0 in O0x0y0z0\nis:\n\n\u00f0xO0A0 ; yO0A0 ; zO0A0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f0x\u00feR; y; z\u00de \u00f03:23\u00de\n\nWe assume that the unit vector of O0A0 is eO0A0 \u00bc O0A0jO0A0 j, the difference between the\ninitial phase of the hovering spacecraft and that of the target spacecraft is:\n\nFig. 3.5 Acceleration of continuous thrust needed to achieve hovering to a highly elliptical orbit\n\n3.2 Design of Fixed-Point Hovering Orbit 47\n\n\n\nD/ \u00bc arcsin\u00f0eO0A0 \u00f02\u00de\u00de \u00f03:24\u00de\n\nThe orbit inclination of the hovering spacecraft i is:\n\ni \u00bc arcsin\u00f0eO0A0 \u00f03\u00de\u00de \u00f03:25\u00de\n\nIn Eqs. (3.24) and (3.25), eO0A0 \u00f02\u00de and eO0A0 \u00f03\u00de represent the second and the third\ncomponents of the unit vector eO0A0 , respectively.\n\nTo keep the hovering spacecraft relatively static in relation to its target space-\ncraft, the orbital rotational angular rate of the hovering spacecraft must be equal to\nthe angular velocity of the target spacecraft. Moreover, the hovering spacecraft\nshould only have tangential velocity, with velocities in other directions being 0. We\nassume the angular velocity of the target spacecraft is n, then the orbital tangential\nvelocity of the hovering spacecraft in the reference system O0x0y0z0 is:\n\nVm \u00bc O0A0j j ? cos\u00f0i\u00de ? n \u00f03:26\u00de\n\nHere, Vm is the value of total velocity of the hovering spacecraft, and the normal\nvelocity in the orbit plane is 0.\n\nWe assume that the hovering distance is L \u00bc 100 km, a \u00bc 127:89?,\nb \u00bc ?16:94?, then eOA \u00bc \u00f0?0:991; 0:0174; 0:128\u00de.

(3.23), the coordi-\nnates of A0 in the reference system Oxyz can be obtained:\n\n?\n?\n\nA\n\nX\n\nY\nZ\n\nO\n\nZ\n\nY\n\nXO\n\nER\n\nA\n\nFig. 3.6 Position of any point in orbital coordinate system\n\n48 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n\u00f0xA0 ; yA0 ; zA0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f0?99161; 1740:6; 12811 m\u00de\n\nFrom Eqs. (3.24) and (3.25), in the reference system O0x0y0z0, the orbit inclina-\ntion of the hovering spacecraft A0 is i \u00bc 0:035?, and the difference of its initial\nphase to that of its target spacecraft is Du \u00bc 0:0048?.\n\nIf the orbit of the target spacecraft is a circular orbit, and the distance between\nthe hovering spacecraft and the target spacecraft is far less than the geocentric\ndistance of the target spacecraft, then the motion of the hovering spacecraft in the\nreference system Oxyz can be described by the Hill Equation:\n\n\u20acx? 2n _y? 3n2x \u00bc fx\n\u20acy\u00fe 2n _x \u00bc fy\n\u20acz\u00fe n2z \u00bc fz\n\n8<\n: \u00f03:27\u00de\n\nHere: n represents the orbital angular velocity of the target spacecraft, fx; fy; fz\n? \t\n\nrepresents the controlling acceleration imposed on each axis of the hovering\nspacecraft.\n\nAs the hovering spacecraft maintains a relatively static position in relation to the\ntarget spacecraft, the velocity components and acceleration components on each\naxis are 0. The mean angular rate of the target spacecraft is n \u00bc 7:2921? 10?5 rad.\nFrom Eq. (3.27), in the reference system Oxyz, the controlling acceleration com-\nponent of the hovering spacecraft is obtained:\n\nfx; fy; fz\n? \t \u00bc 1:585? 10?3; 0;?2:1? 10?5? \t\n\nWe assume that the simulation started on 12:00:00, June 1, 2003. At this\nmoment, relative to the x axis of the J2000 coordinate system, the rotational angular\nrate of geocentric longitude 0? is 69:518?. Since the phase difference between the\nhovering spacecraft and the target spacecraft is D/, it can be obtained that the\nincluded angle between the position of the hovering spacecraft and the xoy plane of\nthe J2000 coordinate system is 69:523?.\n\nAccording to 3-1-3 transfer order, convert the positions and velocities of the two\nsatellites in the orbital coordinate system into the corresponding positions and\nvelocities in the J2000 coordinate system. The position coordinates and velocities\non three axes in the J2000 coordinate system are shown in Table 3.1.\n\nThe value of the controlling acceleration is 0:001585 m=s2. To simplify the\nprogramming and controlling process, the body coordinate system of the hovering\nspacecraft is taken as the reference system and the direction and the value of the\n\nTable 3.1 Initial positions and velocities of target spacecraft and hovering spacecraft\n\nSatellite Initial position x; y; z\u00f0 \u00de (km) Initial velocity _x; _y; _z\u00f0 \u00de (m/s)\nTarget spacecraft ?4203.722 3674.850 0 ?267.974 ?3062.960 0\n\nHovering spacecraft ?4190.509 3664.473 12.811 ?261.47 ?2988.6 0\n\n3.2 Design of Fixed-Point Hovering Orbit 49\n\n\n\ncontrolling acceleration are kept unchanged in this coordinate system. We take\nJ2-perturbation into account, adopt the eight-order Runge-Kutta integrator to solve\nthe satellite\u2019s motional equation, set the time step to be 1 s, and the simulation time\nto be 24 h, generate the orbital data of the target spacecraft and the reference star in\none single period (including the position and velocity of the satellites in the J2000\ncoordinate system).\n\nBy calculating the communication link between the target spacecraft and the\nhovering spacecraft and that between the target spacecraft and a ground station, the\nchanges in the included angle of the two links can be obtained and are shown in\nFig. 3.7.\n\nFrom Fig. 3.7, it can be seen that in the complete orbital operation period, the\nincluded angle of the two links changes between 0\u00b0 and 3.3\u00b0, and the maximum of\n\nFig. 3.8 24 h changes in\nrelative distance between\nhovering spacecraft and target\nspacecraft when hovering\ndistance is 100 km\n\nFig. 3.7 Changes in the\nincluded angle between the\nhovering spacecraft, target\nspacecraft and ground station\nwhen hovering distance is\n100 km\n\n50 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nthe included angle is 3:3?. That is to say, the maximum angle of the hovering\nspacecraft deviating from the link between the target spacecraft and the ground\nstation is 3:3?.\n\nThe changes in the relative distance between the hovering spacecraft and the\ntarget spacecraft are shown in Fig. 3.8.\n\nIt can be seen that the maximum change value of the distance between the two\nsatellites in one orbit period is 0.225 km, the curve swings around 100 km with its\nswinging scope increasing, and the relative orbit of the hovering spacecraft to its\ntarget spacecraft is a helix.\n\nIf the distance between the hovering spacecraft and the target spacecraft is set to\n50-500 km, the relation between the two spacecraft\u2019 distance and the controlling\nacceleration needed to achieve the hovering can be obtained and is shown in\nFig. 3.9.\n\nFrom Fig. 3.9, when the distance between the two satellites is 50 km, the\ncontrolling acceleration needed to maintain the hovering spacecraft on the link is\nless than 10?3 m/s2; when the distance is 500 km, the value of the controlling\nacceleration is about 8 ? 10?3 m/s2.\n\nFrom the above analysis, it can be derived that:\n\n\u2022 When the hovering spacecraft and the target spacecraft are non-coplanar, the\nhovering spacecraft weighs 1000 kg and the distance to the target spacecraft is\n100 km, a continuous control force of 1.585 N will be able to help the hovering\nspacecraft hover on a spiral hovering orbit to the target spacecraft.\n\n\u2022 Strictly speaking, the hovering spacecraft is not hovering at a fixed point, but\ndrifting along with time. That is because the control force is an open-loop\ncontrol. If a closed loop control is adopted, fuel loss can be decreased and the\nhovering spacecraft can be controlled in a certain area precisely.\n\nFig. 3.9 Changes in\nspacecraft\u2019 distance and\ncontrolling acceleration\n\n3.2 Design of Fixed-Point Hovering Orbit 51\n\n\n\nIn Fig. 3.10:\n\n1.

Hence, the linearization errors in simplifying the Hill\nEquation are considered as disturbances. To solve this, a compensatory controlling\nacceleration is added to the control process and a feedback control law is designed.\n\nThe actual relative motion of the target spacecraft and the hovering spacecraft\ncan be described as follows:\n\nFig. 3.10 Spiral hovering orbit\n\n52 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n\u20ac~r \u00bc A1~r\u00feA2 _~r\u00fe~u\u00fe _~u\u00fe c ~r; _~r\n? ?\n\n\u00f03:28\u00de\n\nHere: A1 \u00bc\n3n2 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 ?n2\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5, A2 \u00bc 0 2n 0?2n 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5; _~u represents the com-\n\npensatory controlling acceleration, c ~r; _~r\n? ?\n\nrepresents the linearization errors in Hill\n\nEquation.\nThe ideal state equation can be expressed as:\n\n\u20ac~r ? \u00bc A1~r ? \u00feA2 _~r ? \u00fe~u \u00f03:29\u00de\n\nThe target of control is to have zero error in a limited time.

To prove that the system is also asymptotically stable, substituting\nEq. (3.34) into Eq.

So the system is\nstable.\n\nWith regard to Eq. (3.34), c ~r; _~r\n? ?\n\nis a second-order infinitesimal, whose influ-\n\nence on the system is no more than that of the control.

(3.37) can stabilize the system.\nAccording to the Hill Equation, during the hovering, in order to keep the\n\nposition of the hovering spacecraft in the orbital coordinate system of the target\nsatellite unchanged, the relative velocity and the relative acceleration of the\nhovering spacecraft to the target satellite have to be 0. Therefore, during the\nhovering, the following control force should be imposed on the hovering spacecraft:\n\nfx \u00bc ?3n2x\nfy \u00bc 0\nfx \u00bc n2z\n\n8<\n: \u00f03:39\u00de\n\nWhen we combine Eq.

Thus, the Lyapunov\u2019s theorem has\n\nproved that this control law can help a hovering spacecraft achieve long-time stable\nhovering relative to its target spacecraft.\n\n3.2.3.2 Simulation Analysis\n\nWe suppose that the target spacecraft is in the geosynchronous orbit and the\nhovering spacecraft is 100 km directly under the target spacecraft. So the initial\nconditions of the two spacecraft in the inertial coordinate system are as follows\n(Table 3.2).\n\n54 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nBy adopting the above control law, the result of controlling the hovering\nspacecraft orbit is shown in Fig. 3.11.\n\nFigure 3.11 shows the result of using fixed-point hovering control, or in other\nwords, the effect of the control obtained after a period of control time. Simulation\nresult indicates that after a period of time, the error on the y axis reduces to 0 and\nthe error on the z axis is always 0, while the error on the x axis stabilizes\n1:2? 10?3 m. The total fixed-point error is about 1:2? 10?3 m, which is far less\nthan the hovering distance of 100 km. The result shows the control precision is\nrelatively high.\n\nFigure 3.12 illustrates the change curve of the compensatory controlling accel-\neration needed when the fixed-point hovering is finished. The simulation result\nshows that after a period of time, the controlling acceleration on the y axis reduces\nto 0 while the X axis always needs a small compensatory acceleration. That is to\nsay, there is always a force holding the hovering spacecraft.\n\nIf the hovering time is 24 h, the increment accumulation of the compensatory\ncontrolling acceleration on the X axis is 0.322 m/s2, that on the Y axis is 0.027 m/s2,\nand the acceleration on the Z axis is always 0. The total increment of the controlling\nacceleration is 138.588 m/s2, which is apparently feasible.\n\nTable 3.2 Initial conditions\nof hovering spacecraft and\ntarget spacecraft in inertial\ncoordinate system\n\nSatellite Initial position\nx; y; z\u00f0 \u00de (km)\n\nInitial velocity\n_x; _y; _z\u00f0 \u00de (km/s)\n\nTarget spacecraft 41,164.2 0 0 0 3.0747 0\n\nHovering spacecraft 42,064 0 0 0 3.0673 0\n\nFig. 3.11 Relative position\nerrors of three axes\n\n3.2 Design of Fixed-Point Hovering Orbit 55\n\n\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit\n\nA regional hovering orbit is the relative motion orbit of a hovering spacecraft,\nsubjected to a control system, to its target satellite during a period of time and in a\ngiven region. In this kind of relative hovering orbit, orbit control should be con-\nducted only when the hovering spacecraft reaches the boundary of the given region.\nCompared with the fixed-point hovering, when the hovering spacecraft moves in\nthe confined area, it only needs attitude pointing control and does not require the\nsatellite control system to conduct a continuous control of attitude and orbit cou-\npling, thus realizes the attitude and orbit control separation of the hovering\nspacecraft. Therefore, a regional hovering orbit can effectively decrease the\ndemands on each subsystem for the satellite when the hovering spacecraft is doing\non-orbit services and is beneficial to the implementation of on-orbit autonomous\nservicing missions.\n\n3.3.1 Analysis of Confined Area Configuration\n\n3.3.1.1 Description of Confined Area Configuration\n\nTo obtain the relative motion state of the hovering spacecraft in the confined area, it\nis necessary to have a proper modeling and description about the space configu-\nration of the confined area to the target satellite.

We suppose the\ndistance between the origin o0 and the orbital coordinate origin of the target satellite\nis l, the azimuth is a, the elevation angle is b, then the coordinates of the origin o0 in\nthe orbital coordinate system of the target satellite \u00f0xc; yc; zc\u00de can be described as\nfollows:\n\nxc\nyc\nzc\n\n0\nB@\n\n1\nCA \u00bc\n\nl cos b cos a\n\nl cos b sin a\n\nl sin b\n\n0\nB@\n\n1\nCA \u00f03:40\u00de\n\nWe suppose that o0 ? b1b2b3 rotates in the order of 3-1-2 for g; n; 1 respec-\ntively and then coincides with the orbital coordinate system of the target satellite,\nthen the transfer matrix of the regional coordinate system o0 ? b1b2b3 and the\norbital coordinate system of the target satellite is:\n\nTRSWo0?b1b2b3 \u00bc\ncos 1 0 ? sin 1\n0 1 0\n\nsin 1 0 cos 1\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 1 0 00 cos n sin n\n\n0 ? sin n cos n\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 cos g sin g 0? sin g cos g 0\n\n0 0 1\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5\n\n\u00f03:41\u00de\n\nHence, the transfer formula that is able to transfer the coordinates \u00f0x1; y1; z1\u00de in\nthe coordinate system o0 ? b1b2b3 into the coordinates \u00f0x; y; z\u00de in the target orbital\ncoordinate system is:\n\nFig. 3.13 Schematic figure of confined area configuration\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 57\n\n\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\n0\nB@\n\n1\nCA \u00bc TRSWo0?b1b2b3\n\nx1\n\ny1\n\nz1\n\n0\nB@\n\n1\nCA\u00fe\n\nxc\nyc\nzc\n\n0\nB@\n\n1\nCA \u00f03:42\u00de\n\nThus, the relationship between the regional coordinate system and the orbital\ncoordinate system of the target satellite can be established. And it is very conve-\nnient to transfer the coordinates of the hovering spacecraft in the regional rectan-\ngular coordinate system into the orbital coordinate system of the target satellite.\n\n3.3.1.2 Typical Confined Area Configurations\n\nSince there are different operation modes and space missions for a hovering\nspacecraft, the confined area can have multiple configurations. This section will first\nmodel some basic 3D configurations, which are sphere, ellipse, cylinder and taper.\nThen these basic configurations will be used to construct the required confined area\nconfigurations in different missions.\n\n(1) Sphere\n\nWhen the confined area is spherical, in the regional rectangular coordinate\nsystem, we suppose the center coordinates in this area are \u00f0x0; y0; z0\u00de, the spherical\nradius is r, then the configuration of the spherical confined area can be expressed as:\n\n\u00f0x? x0\u00de2 \u00fe\u00f0y? y0\u00de2 \u00fe\u00f0z? z0\u00de2 \t r2 \u00f03:43\u00de\n\nIf the coordinates of the sphere center in the spherical area are (50, 50, 50 km),\nand the radius is 20 km, then the configuration of the confined area is shown in\nFig. 3.14.\n\n(2) Ellipse\n\nWhen the confined area is elliptical, in the regional rectangular coordinate\nsystem, we suppose the center coordinates in this area are \u00f0x0; y0; z0\u00de, the lengths of\nthe three axes of the ellipse are \u00f0xr; yr; zr\u00de, then the configuration of the elliptical\nconfined area can be expressed as:\n\n\u00f0x? x0\u00de2\nx2r\n\n\u00fe \u00f0y? y0\u00de\n2\n\ny2r\n\u00fe \u00f0z? z0\u00de\n\n2\n\nz2r\n\t 1 \u00f03:44\u00de\n\nIf the coordinates of the sphere center in the elliptical area are (50, 50, 50 km),\nand the lengths of the three axes of the ellipse are (20, 50, 10 km), then the\nconfiguration of the confined area is shown in Fig. 3.15.\n\n58 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n(3) Cylinder\n\nWhen the confined area is cylindrical, according to different section shapes of\nthe bottom, the cylinder can be divided into a spherical cylinder and an elliptical\ncylinder. In the regional rectangular coordinate system, the configuration of the\ncylindrical confined area can be expressed as:\n\n\u00f0x?x0\u00de2\nx2r\n\n\u00fe \u00f0y?y0\u00de2y2r \t 1\nHmin \t z\tHmax\n\n(\n\u00f03:45\u00de\n\nHere: \u00f0x0; y0\u00de represents the curve center of the bottom section, \u00f0xr; yr\u00de repre-\nsents the chord lengths of the curve, Hmin and Hmax represent the minimal altitude\nand the maximum altitude of the cylindrical area respectively.

Likewise, the space configuration of an ellip-\ntical confined area can be obtained.\n\n(4) Taper\n\nWhen the confined area is tapered according to different section shapes of the\nbottom, the taper can be a cone or an elliptical cone. In the regional rectangular\ncoordinate system, the configuration of the tapered confined area can be expressed\nas:\n\n\u00f0x? x0\u00de2\nx2r\n\n\u00fe \u00f0y? y0\u00de\n2\n\ny2r\n? \u00f0z? z0\u00de\n\n2\n\nz2r\n\t 0 \u00f03:46\u00de\n\nHere: \u00f0x0; y0; z0\u00de represents the position offset of the bottom surface center of the\ntaper relative to the origin, \u00f0xr; yr\u00de represents the chord lengths of the curve of the\nbottom section, and zr represents the altitude of the taper When xr \u00bc yr, the cylinder\nis a cone; when xr 6\u00bc yr, the cylinder is an elliptical cone. Figure 3.17 illustrates the\nconfiguration of a conical confined area with the bottom surface center being (100,\n100, 280 km), and the bottom section radius and altitude being 50 and 160 km,\nrespectively. Likewise, the space configuration of the elliptical cone confined area\ncan be obtained.\n\nFour most basic space area configurations are discussed above. In reality, due to\ndifferent mission requirements and work modes of target object, the confined area\nmight not be any one of the four types mentioned above, but can be a combination\nof these four basic space configurations or a transformation of them. For instance, if\nthe confined area is a truncated conical configuration, this configuration can be\nobtained by two ones cutting each other.\n\nFig. 3.16 Space\nconfiguration of cylindrical\nconfined area\n\n60 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n3.3.1.3 Analysis of Confined Area Configuration\n\nAccording to actual constraint conditions, the hovering spacecraft can only move in\na pre-defined confined area to its target satellite. Without the loss of generality, we\nsuppose the confined area is an elliptic cylindrical space configuration, this model\ncan be obtained by changing the size of the bottom section of a cylinder firstly and\nthen rotating the coordinate system.\n\nIn the plane o0 ? b1b2, the section of the confined area is an elliptical curve. We\nsuppose the semi-major axis of the elliptical curve is s1, the semi-minor axis is s2,\nas shown in Fig. 3.18.\n\nWe suppose the position of the hovering spacecraft in this confined area is\nexpressed as \u00f0x1; y1\u00de, then\n\nFig. 3.17 Space\nconfiguration of conical\nconfined area\n\nFig. 3.18 Constraint in\nconfined area plane\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 61\n\n\n\nw1 \u00bc\narctg y1x1 x1 [ 0; y1 \n 0\n2p\u00fe arctg y1x1 x1 [ 0; y1\\0\np\u00fe arctg y1x1 x1\\0\n\n8<\n: \u00f03:47\u00de\n\nHere: w1 is the included angle between o\n0x1 and o0b1, representing the phase of\n\nthe hovering spacecraft in the elliptical area, with the anticlockwise direction being\npositive. Based on the elliptical formula, the intersection \u00f0x2; y2\u00de of the straight line\no0x1 and the boundary of the elliptical area can be described as:\n\nx2\ny2\n\n !\n\u00bc\n\ns1s2 cosw1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ns21 sin\n\n2 w1 \u00fe s22 cos2 w1\nq\n\ns1s2 sinw1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ns21 sin\n\n2 w1 \u00fe s22 cos2 w1\nq\n\n0\nBBBBB@\n\n1\nCCCCCA \u00f03:48\u00de\n\nThus it can be seen that the position parameters of the hovering spacecraft in this\nplane must meet the following relationship in order to ensure the spacecraft is in\nthis confined area:\n\nx21 \u00fe y21 \t x22 \u00fe y22 x1 6\u00bc 0\ny1j j \t y2j j x1 \u00bc 0\n\n?\n\u00f03:49\u00de\n\nWe suppose that the altitude in the confined area is H as is shown in Fig. 3.19,\nthus the position of the hovering spacecraft z1 in coordinate system o0 ? b1b2b3\ncannot be higher than the altitude of the elliptical cylinder H, which is\n\n0\t z1 \tH \u00f03:50\u00de\n\nFig. 3.19 Constraint beyond\nconfined area plane\n\n62 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Control of Regional Hovering Orbit\n\n3.3.2.1 Control Model of Relative Motion\n\nWhen the hovering spacecraft conducts detailed reconnaissance on the target\nsatellite, compared to the orbit altitude of the target satellite, the relative distance\nbetween the hovering spacecraft and the target satellite is an infinitesimal\namount.

As the relative motion of the hovering spacecraft in and out of the\norbit plane of the target satellite is decoupled, the constraints in regional hovering\norbit design can be studied from in-plane and out-of-plane of the target satellite\u2019s\norbit.\n\n(1) In-plane trajectory constraint\n\nIn the orbit plane of the target satellite, the relative motion trajectory of the\nhovering spacecraft between two adjacent impulsive points gradually becomes\nlarger as the time of free flight increases. When the flight time between the two\nimpulsive points becomes long enough, the relative motion trajectory of the\nhovering spacecraft will go beyond the confined area as is shown in the following\nfigure.\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 65\n\n\n\nIn Fig. 3.20, the dotted ellipse represents an elliptical confined area in the orbital\ncoordinate system of the target satellite. In the left figure, the time of flight of\ntrajectories 1, 2 and 3 are 1.5932e+004 s, 2.0472e+004 s and 2.2932e+004 s,\nrespectively; in the right figure, the time of flight of trajectories 1, 2 and 3 are\n1.3520e+004 s, 1.7520e+004 s and 1.9720e+004 s, respectively. It is obvious that\ndue to the excessively long time of the free flight, the relative motion trajectory (i.e.,\ntrajectory 3) of the tracking spacecraft goes beyond the confined area.\n\nTherefore, with regard to the short-range relative motion under the control of\nimpulse, if T 0max is the maximum permissible free flight time of the hovering\nspacecraft between two adjacent impulsive points, then only when the free flight\ntime of the hovering spacecraft T \t T 0max, the relative motion trajectory will not go\nbeyond the confined area.\n\nWe suppose that the configuration of the confined area is an elliptical area as\nshown in Fig. 3.21.\n\nHere, o? xy represents the coordinate system in the orbit plane of the target\nsatellite. The direction of axis y is in accordance with the along-track direction of\nthe target and the direction of axis x is in accordance with the radial direction of the\ntarget. o0 ? x0y0 is a translational coordinate system and o0 ? b1b2 is a rectangular\ncoordinate system in the plane. l1 represents the distance between the regional\ncenter and the target satellite and a represents the azimuth of the regional center in\nthe orbital coordinate system of the target satellite. g represents the rotated angle of\no0 ? b1b2 relative to o0 ? x0y0. s1 and s2 represent the size of the elliptical regional\nconfiguration. wi represents the phase size of the hovering spacecraft in this area,\nwith the counterclockwise rotation along axis o0 ? b2 being positive.\n\nWe suppose that all the impulsive points are imposed at the boundary of the\nconfined area, then the position coordinates of the impulsive points \u00f0xi; yi\u00de can be\nrepresented by the phase of the hovering spacecraft wi in the confined area. We\nsuppose the phases of any two adjacent impulsive points i and i\u00fe 1 are wi and\nwi\u00fe 1, respectively, when the configuration of the confined area is given, the cor-\nresponding maximum time of a free flight between impulsive points i and i\u00fe 1 is\n\nFig. 3.20 Relative motion trajectory of spacecraft according to different time of flight\n\n66 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nTmax\u00f0wi; wi\u00fe 1\u00de. When all the boundary points of the confined area are considered,\na distribution curve of the maximum time of the free flight between any adjacent\nimpulsive points can be obtained. The calculation of obtaining the maximum time\nof the free flight is as follows (Fig. 3.22).\n\nHere, Tupper and Tlow represent the upper and lower limits of the initialized\nvalues of the flight time respectively. We can take the observation of a high orbit\ntarget satellite as an example. Generally, as the observation time is less than the\norbit period of the target satellite, we can set Tlow \u00bc 0. Here, Tupper represents one\nsingle orbit period of the target satellite; tol represents the allowable error.\n\nWe can take the target satellite in the geostationary orbit as an example. If the\nconfiguration parameters of the confined area are a \u00bc ?30?, l1 \u00bc 50 m, g \u00bc 30?,\ns1 \u00bc 20 m, s2 \u00bc 10 m, then between any two points, the distribution curve of the\nmaximum time of a free flight used by the hovering spacecraft is shown in\nFig. 3.23.\n\nThe left figure shows the distribution curve of the hovering spacecraft\u2019s free\nflight time, and the right figure shows the relative configuration of the confined area\nin the target orbit plane. The cases shown in Figs. 3.24, 3.25, 3.26 and 3.27 are\nsimilar and will be not explained again.\n\nWe can take the parameters of the confined area shown in Fig. 3.23 as the\nreference.

Here, the azimuth in Fig. (a) is ?45?, that in Fig. (b) is ?60?, and the\nazimuths are one point five times and twice of the size of the reference parameters\nrespectively.\n\nFrom the simulation result, it can be seen that, the bigger the azimuth of the\nregional center, the larger the distribution range of the free flight time.\n\n(2) Out-of-plane Trajectory Constraint\n\nBased on the dynamic model of relative motion, the relative motion equation of\nthe hovering spacecraft out of the orbit plane of the target satellite is as follows:\n\nFig. 3.26 Influence of change in distance between regional center and target satellite on time of\nfree flight\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 71\n\n\n\n\u20acz\u00fe n2z? acz \u00bc 0 \u00f03:61\u00de\n\nIf the initial position z0 and the initial velocity _z0 of the hovering spacecraft\u2019s\nnormal direction in the orbital coordinate system of the target satellite are known,\nthen the solution of Eq.

From\nEq. (3.62), it can be assumed that the motion state of the hovering spacecraft in the\n\nFig. 3.27 Influence of change in azimuth of the regional center relative to target satellite on flight\ntime\n\n72 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\norbital coordinate system of the target satellite in the normal direction is related to its\ninitial relative position and its initial relative velocity in the normal direction.\nFurthermore, the relative motion is a simple harmonic motion with an amplitude of Z.\n\nThe constraint condition of the hovering spacecraft in the orbital coordinate\nsystem of the target satellite in the normal direction can be calculated based on the\nregional configuration parameters. If the regional configuration is as Fig. 3.28\nshows:\n\nThen:\n\nZmin \u00bc l sin b\nZmax \u00bc l sin b\u00feH\n\n?\n\u00f03:63\u00de\n\nHere, H represents the altitude of the confined area in the orbital coordinate\nsystem of the target satellite in the normal direction; Zmin and Zmax represent the\nshortest and the longest distances between the hovering spacecraft and the target\nsatellite in the orbital coordinate system of the target satellite respectively.\n\nWhen Z\t Zmax, the hovering spacecraft under the uncontrolled condition will\nnot go beyond the farthest end of the confined area. In this case, only the orbit\ncontrol required when the hovering spacecraft is at the near-end of the confined area\nshould be considered. When the hovering spacecraft moves to the near-end of the\nconfined area and keeps moving towards the target satellite, an impulsive control\n\nFig. 3.28 Schematic figure\nof out-of-plane constraint of\ntarget satellite orbit\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 73\n\n\n\nshould be imposed to keep the hovering spacecraft in the confined area. At the\nnear-end, the relative motion state of the hovering spacecraft satisfies the following\nconditions:\n\nZ sin\u00f0nt\u00feu\u00de \u00bc Zmin \u00f03:64\u00de\n\nWhen this equation is solved, the following can be obtained:\n\nt1 \u00bc 1n sin?1 ZminZ\n? \t? u? ?\n\nt2 \u00bc 1n p? sin?1 ZminZ\n? \t? u? ?\n\n?\n\u00f03:65\u00de\n\nTherefore, the time interval between two adjacent impulsive controls is:\n\nDt \u00bc t2 ? t1 \u00bc 1w p? 2 sin\n?1 Zmin\n\nZ\n\n? ?? \n\u00f03:66\u00de\n\nAnd the impulsive value needed is:\n\nDv \u00bc _z1 ? _z2 \u00bc nZ cos\u00f0nt1 \u00feu\u00de ? cos nt2 \u00feu\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?\n\n\u00bc nZ cos sin?1 Zmin\nZ\n\n? ?? ?\n? cos p? sin?1 Zmin\n\nZ\n\n? ?? ?? \n\n\u00bc nZ cos sin?1 Zmin\nZ\n\n? ?? ?\n\u00fe Zmin\n\nZ\n\n? \n \u00f03:67\u00de\n\nFigure 3.29 illustrates the curve of the two adjacent impulsive controls changing\nalong with Zmin=Z. It can be seen that the bigger the value of Zmin=Z, the shorter\nthe time interval of the control. As shown in Fig. 3.29, when Zmin=Z \u00bc 0, i.e., when\nthe near-end of the confined area is just in the orbit plane of the target satellite, the\n\nFig. 3.29 Relation between\ntime interval and Zmin=Z\n\n74 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nperiod of the impulsive control is half of the target orbit period; when Zmin=Z \u00bc 1,\ni.e., when the hovering spacecraft is confined at the top of the normal direction of\nthe target orbit, the time interval of the impulsive control is 0, which means a\ncontinuous thrust has to be imposed on the hovering spacecraft.\n\nWhen Z\n Zmax, the hovering spacecraft needs control in the normal direction,\nand the time of the control is:\n\nZ sin\u00f0nt1 \u00feu\u00de \u00bc Zmin\nZ sin\u00f0nt2 \u00feu\u00de \u00bc Zmax\n\n?\n\u00f03:68\u00de\n\nWhen this equation is solved, the following can be obtained:\n\nt1 \u00bc 1n sin?1 ZminZ\n? \t? u? ?\n\nt2 \u00bc 1n sin?1 ZmaxZ\n? \t? u? ?\n\n?\n\u00f03:69\u00de\n\nTherefore, the time interval of the control is:\n\nDt \u00bc 1\nn\n\nsin?1\nZmax\nZ\n\n? ?\n? sin?1 Zmin\n\nZ\n\n? ?? \n\u00f03:70\u00de\n\nBased on the dynamic equation of relative motion, the impulsive value needed in\nevery control can be calculated at the corresponding control node. There is no need\nfor further explanation here.\n\nFigure 3.30 shows the changes of the time interval of the impulsive control\nalong with Zmax=Z and Zmin=Z. From the figure, it can be seen that as Zmin=Z\nbecomes bigger, or as Zmax=Z becomes smaller, the time interval between two\n\nFig. 3.30 Relation between time interval and Zmin=Z, Zmin=Z\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 75\n\n\n\nadjacent impulsive controls becomes shorter. It can also be seen that when\nZmax=Z \u00bc Zmin=Z, the time interval of the impulsive control in the normal direction\nis 0, which means the impulsive control changes into the continuous thrust control.\n\n(3) Other constraints\n\nThe design and control of the regional hovering orbit have to meet the constraint\non the relative motion trajectory of the spacecraft. At the same time, many other\nfactors also need to be considered. For example, with regard to the design of the\nconfined area\u2019s configuration parameters, the requirements on the size and the\nazimuth of the confined area for a certain mission should be considered; with regard\nto the control of the regional hovering orbit, it is necessary to take into account the\nrestrictions on the thrust\u2019s value and direction needed by the hovering spacecraft in\ndesigning the orbit control sequences.\n\n3.3.3 Regional Hovering Orbit of Single-Pulse Trust\n\nCompared with the complex attitude and orbit coupling control of the fixed-point\nhovering orbit, the advantage of the regional hovering orbit is that it realizes the\nseparation of orbit control and attitude control. The hovering spacecraft only needs\nto carry out orbit control at the boundary of the confined area. And when the\nhovering spacecraft is in the confined area, only attitude pointing control is needed.\nThis kind of separation of attitude control and orbit control brings great benefit to\nthe control of the hovering spacecraft and tremendously enhances the applicability\nof the regional hovering orbit. This section will be about two optimized control\nmethods of the regional hovering orbit under the control of a single-pulse, which\nare the minimum rate of energy consuming mode and the fixed time mode.\n\n3.3.3.1 Minimum Rate of Energy Consuming Mode\n\nWith regard to some space missions (for example, on-orbit service, key module\nreplacement and repair), the flight time of the hovering spacecraft in the confined\narea is not pre-set, but becomes longer as the mission extends. Therefore, the\nminimum energy consuming rate of the hovering spacecraft during the whole\nmission should be considered as the optimizing index.\n\nThe hovering spacecraft enters the confined area from one boundary point\n(called the entry point) and exits from another boundary point (called the exit\npoint). The position coordinates of the impulsive point in the confined area can be\nexpressed by its phase angle, which means w1 and w2 are used to describe the\npositions of the entry point and the exit point. We propose that the state \u00f0q1;q?1 \u00de of\nthe initial point w1 and the state q2 of the exit point w2 are known, then the time of\n\n76 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nthe free flight T between adjacent impulsive points can be determined by Eq. (4.60).\nHere Dv is only the function of variable T and can be expressed as:\n\nDv \u00bc _q\u00fe1 ? _q?1 \u00bc f \u00f0T\u00de \u00f03:71\u00de\n\nWhen we take the variation of the mean velocity of the hovering spacecraft as\nthe optimizing index, the following can be obtained:\n\nJ \u00bc\nX\n\nDvj\n?? ??=X Tj \u00f03:72\u00de\n\nHere: Dvj represents the velocity increment needed at the j th time in imposing\norbit control. As energy consuming has nothing to do with direction, so the fol-\nlowing index function is adopted:\n\nJ \u00bc\nX\n\nDv2j\n.X\n\nTj \u00f03:73\u00de\n\nFor the single-pulse control:\n\nJ \u00bc Dv2j\n.\nTj \u00bc f 2\u00f0Tj\u00de=Tj \u00f03:74\u00de\n\nHere, Dvj \u00bc q\u00fei?1\n? \t\n\nj?q?i?1 \u00bc f \u00f0Tj\u00de represents the velocity variation when the\nhovering spacecraft imposes control for the jth time at the entry point, and Tj\nrepresents the single free flight time of the hovering spacecraft.\n\nEquation (3.74) is a composite function containing inverse circular functions\nand polynomials with a complicated form. It is hard to give it an explicit expression,\nthough it will not influence the programming of the simulation and the realization of\nthe optimization results. The concrete optimization design model is:\n\nJ \u00bc min\u00f0f 2\u00f0Tj\u00de=Tj\u00de\n\nst\n\nf \u00f0Tj\u00de \u00bc Dvj\nX\u00f0t0\u00de \u00bc qi?1\nX\u00f0t0 \u00fe Tj\u00de \u00bc qi\n0\t Tj \t Tmax\u00f0i? 1; i\u00de\n\n8>>><\n>>>:\n\n\u00f03:75\u00de\n\nThe only optimization variable in Eq. (3.75) is Tj. Note that the value of Tj\nshould be smaller than the value of the maximum free flight time Tmax\u00f0i? 1; i\u00de.\n\nWe propose that the regional configuration parameters are a \u00bc ?30?, l \u00bc 50 m,\ng \u00bc 30?, s1 \u00bc 20 m, s2 \u00bc 30 m, the position of the entry point of the hovering\nspacecraft is w1 \u00bc 90?, the spacecraft\u2019s velocity before being imposed an impulse at\nthe initial point in the radial and along-track directions are both 1 m=s, the positions\nof the exit point w2 of the hovering spacecraft required by the simulation in the\nregional coordinate system are 0?, 180?, 270?. We use the GA optimization toolbox\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 77\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6_4\n\n\nin MATLAB to obtain their optimal free flight time T respectively, and the results\nare shown in Table 3.3.\n\nFigures 3.31, 3.32, 3.33 and 3.34 provide the relationship between the index\nfunction and the free flight time and the optimal relative motion trajectory under the\nabove four conditions.

Therefore, the\npurpose of optimization is to keep the free flight time consumed by the hovering\nspacecraft in the confined area as long as possible.\n\nHence, under the minimum rate of energy consumption mode, the longer the free\nflight time between adjacent impulsive points, the better. As the flight time cannot\nexceed the constraint on its maximum free flight time, the maximum free flight time\nbetween the entry point and the exit point should be taken as the optimal free flight\ntime.\n\n3.3.3.2 Fixed Time Mode\n\nWith regard to missions which are time-sensitive (for example, short-range\nreconnaissance and monitoring), the time nodes for the tasks of the hovering\nspacecraft are preset. Once a task is completed, the spacecraft has to quit the present\ntask or carry out the next task. As the time of these tasks are fixed, the minimum\nenergy consumption during the whole mission can be taken as the optimizing index.\n\nFig. 3.33 Index function curve of exit point w2 \u00bc 180? and relative motion trajectory\n\nFig. 3.34 Index function curve of exit point w2 \u00bc 270? and relative motion trajectory\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 79\n\n\n\nThe hovering spacecraft enters the confined area from a certain point on the\nboundary and has to leave the area after a period T of interference. Therefore, the\nknown conditions are entry point w01 s position q1, the velocity before being\nimposed an impulsive _q?1 and the mission time T.\n\nWe suppose that the spacecraft exits the confined area from point w2, then it can\nbe known from Eq. (3.60) that Dv is only the function of variable q2 and can be\nexpressed as:\n\nDv \u00bc _q\u00fe1 ? _q?1 \u00bc f \u00f0q2\u00de \u00f03:76\u00de\n\nWe can take the variation of the total velocity of the hovering spacecraft as the\noptimizing index:\n\nJ \u00bc\nX\n\nD vij j \u00f03:77\u00de\n\nHere: Dvi \u00bc _q\u00fei ? _q?i represents the velocity variation needed when the\nhovering spacecraft imposes orbit control at point i.

It should be noted here that, as to\n\nthe position of the optimized exit point w j\n2\n, it has to ensure that the maximum free\n\nflight time Tmax\u00f01; j\u00de should be longer than the mission time T .\nWe suppose the regional configuration parameters are a \u00bc ?30?, l \u00bc 50 m,\n\ng \u00bc 30?, s1 \u00bc 20 m, s2 \u00bc 30 m, the position of the entry point of the hovering\nspacecraft is w1 \u00bc 90?, the spacecraft\u2019s velocity before being imposed an impulsive\nat the initial point in the radial and along-track directions are both 1 m/s, the\nmission time are 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively. We use the GA optimization toolbox in\nMATLAB to obtain the optimal positions of the exit point w2 respectively, and the\nresults are shown in Table 3.4.\n\nIt can be seen that the longer the mission, the larger the velocity variation of the\nhovering spacecraft. Figures 3.35, 3.36 and 3.37 provide the relations between\nthe index function and the exit point and the optimal relative motion trajectories in\nthe three cases. Here, the left figures show the relations between the index function\nand the position of the exit point, and the right figures show the optimal relative\nmotion trajectories.\n\nFig. 3.35 Index function curve and relative motion trajectory when interference time is two hours\n\nTable 3.4 Optimization results\n\nPosition of entry\npoint (\u00b0)\n\nMission\ntime (h)\n\nOptimal position of exit\npoint (\u00b0)\n\nVelocity\nvariation (m/s)\n\n90 2 15.70 1.4153\n\n90 4 6.35 1.4176\n\n90 6 357.91 1.4192\n\n3.3 Design of Regional Hovering Orbit 81\n\n\n\nFrom the index function curves, it can be known that under every circumstance, the\nposition of the optimized exit point is able to minimize the energy consumption of the\nhovering spacecraft when it is conducting correspondingmissions. It can be known from\nthe above results that the velocity variation of the hovering spacecraft is related to the\nposition of the exit point. Besides, the longer the hovering spacecraft lingers in the\nconfinedarea, thebigger thevelocity variation is and themore the energy consumption is.\n\n3.3.4 Regional Hovering Orbit of Multi-Pulse Trust\n\nUnder the control of single-pulse, the flight time of the hovering spacecraft in the\nconfined area is limited as is shown in Sect. 3.3.3. When the lingering time of\nthe hovering spacecraft required by the mission in the confined area exceeds the\nmaximum time, the relative motion trajectory of the hovering spacecraft will go\nbeyond the confined area. As is shown in Fig. 3.38, the mission time is ten hours and\nthatmeans one single-pulse control cannotmeet the requirements of themission.With\nregard to missions such as on-orbit services, the mission time is generally unknown\nand may exceed the maximum free flight time allowed under the single-pulse control.\n\nFig. 3.36 Index function curve and relative motion trajectory when disturbance time is four hours\n\nFig. 3.37 Index function curve and relative motion trajectory when disturbance time is six hours\n\n82 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nTherefore, in order to increase the free flight time of the hovering spacecraft in the\nconfined area, it is necessary to consider the method of multi-pulse control.\n\nThe major factors which influence the regional hovering spacecraft under\nmulti-pulse control are the frequency of pulse control, the position of every\nimpulsive point and the free flight time between adjacent impulsive points. As to\nthe choices of optimizing indexes and control methods under different circum-\nstances, further study can be conducted.\n\nObviously, compared with the fixed-point hovering orbit, the regional hovering\norbit is easier to control and has a broad prospect in on-orbit fault detection and\non-orbit monitoring, providing new technical means for spatial operations in the\nfuture. We should note that when the hovering time required exceeds the maximum\nfree flight time, the multi-pulse control should be imposed in order to keep the\nhovering spacecraft remaining in the confined area.\n\n3.4 Design of Displaced Geostationary Orbit\n\n1As the number of spacecraft in the geostationary orbit (GEO) is growing and the\nspacecraft is restricted by the deployment in the latitudinal direction, the GEO is\ngetting more crowded. For the sake of this problem, America and other countries\nhave adopted the near-equatorial plane orbit or the equatorial orbit to make up the\nlack of resources in the GEO.\n\nFig. 3.38 Relative motion\ntrajectory when hovering time\nis ten hours\n\n1Jeannette Heiligers, Matteo Ceriotti, Colin R.

The orbit period of the GEO is the same as the rotation\nperiod of the Earth and the satellites in the GEO keep relative static to their\nterrestrial points. By utilizing this feature, GEO satellites can provide a continuous\ncommunication support to the ground users in a certain region. And because of the\nadvantages brought about by this unique feature, various countries are competing\nfor the precious resources. This makes the GEO become increasingly crowded,\nespecially for the regions over the lands. In order to create new GEO space, in\nrecent years, scholars have proposed some non-Keplerian orbits (NKO) such as the\nnear-equatorial plane orbit and the equatorial orbit, which are also known as the\ndisplaced geostationary orbit (displaced GEO). These NKOs use continuous thrust\nto balance the Earth\u2019s gravitational acceleration, and extensive research has been\nconducted in the existence, stability and control of the orbits. The NKOs have also\nbeen proved in many applications, including spatial short-range approaching,\nreconnaissance and communication in high latitude areas and lunar remote com-\nmunication, etc.\n\nDisplaced orbits are often used to find a balance between two bodies in a rotating\nreference coordinate system. The method can be specified by the following\nexample. In Fig. 3.39, R xR; yR; zR\u00f0 \u00de is a rotating coordinate system with an rotation\nangle of x \u00bc xz?R, I X; Y ; Z\u00f0 \u00de is a inertial coordinate system with the zR axis\ncoinciding with the Z axis.\n\nTo achieve a displaced orbit, a thrust acceleration a is needed. Then the motion\nof the spacecraft in the rotating coordinate system can be described as:\n\nFig. 3.39 Reference coordinate system of displaced orbit\n\n84 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\n\u20acr\u00fe 2x? _r\u00ferU \u00bc a \u00f03:82\u00de\n\nWe assume that l is the gravitational constant of the central body and U is the\ncommon potential function of the central gravitation body and other centripetal\nacceleration, then\n\nU \u00bc ? l=r\u00f0 \u00de ? 1\n2\n\nx? rk k2 \u00f03:83\u00de\n\nIf in Eq. (3.82), _r \u00bc \u20acr \u00bc 0, when we remove the first two terms, the following\ncan be obtained:\n\nrU \u00bc a \u00f03:84\u00de\n\nThe above directly gives the acceleration needed to maintain the displaced orbit.\nAs x is a fixed value, the vector of the control force needed is in the plane\n\ndetermined by the position vector r and the Z axis and has no component in its\ntransverse section. The direction of the control force is described by the inclination\na, which is\n\ntan a \u00bc zR ?rUk k\nzR ? rU \u00f03:85\u00de\n\nFinally, U can be expressed by parameters in the q; h; h\u00f0 \u00de polar coordinates in\nFig. 3.39, which is\n\nU \u00bc ? 1\n2\n\nxq\u00f0 \u00de2 \u00fe l\nr\n\n? ?\n\u00f03:86\u00de\n\nWhen we substitute Eq. (3.86) into Eqs. (3.84) and (3.85), the value and the\ndirection of the thrust acceleration imposed can be obtained as the following:\n\ntan a q;h;h\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc qh 1?\nx\nx?\n\n? ?2 !\n\u00f03:87\u00de\n\na q;h;h\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nq2 x2 ? x2?\n? \t\u00fe h2x4?q \u00f03:88\u00de\n\nHere, x? is the orbital angular velocity of a Keplerian orbit with the same radius,\nwhich can be described as:\n\nx? \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nl=r3\n\np\n\u00bc\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nl\n.\n\nq2 \u00fe h2\u00f0 \u00de3=2\nr\n\n\u00f03:89\u00de\n\n3.4 Design of Displaced Geostationary Orbit 85\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Displaced Orbit Deviating from Orbit Plane\n\nWith regard to the GEO, x \u00bc xGEO \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nl\n?\nr3GEO\n\nq\n, rGEO \u00bc 42;164:1696 km. We\n\nfurther assume the vertical distance h between the spacecraft and the GEO (as\nshown in Fig. 3.39) is determined, then Eq. (4.81) can be used to find the optimal q\nto minimize the acceleration needed. We take the first derivative of q in Eq. (3.88)\nand obtain:\n\nr6 \u00fe l\nx2\n\nr3 ? 3 l\nx2\n\nh2r ? 2 l\nx2\n\n? ?2\n\u00bc 0 \u00f03:90\u00de\n\nThen we solve the above 6th-order equation and omit the complex roots and the\nnegative roots. Based on the Descartes Law, Eq. (3.90) has a positive real root.\nEquation (3.90) cannot be solved by the analytical method, but can be solved by the\nNewton Method in the numerical method. The solution is shown in Fig. 3.40.\n\nThe acceleration in Fig. 3.40 is a dimensionless quantity and is described by the\nratio of the acceleration to the rotation acceleration on the Earth\u2019s surface. The\nfigure indicates that if the distance between the displaced orbit and the reference\norbit plane becomes longer, i.e., the h becomes bigger, the value of the acceleration\nneeded becomes larger; however, in order to prevent the spacecraft in the displaced\norbit from affecting the spacecraft in the GEO, the minimum h is often pre-set.\nWhen we take into account the related regulations stipulated by the International\nTelecommunication Union and different countries, we assume the migration heights\nare 35 km, 75 km and 150 km, respectively. We solve Eq. (3.90) and obtain r.\n\nFig. 3.40 Outline of\nminimum acceleration needed\nwhen h is given\n\n86 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6_4\n\n\nThen we can obtain the inclination a through Eq. (3.87). The optimized displaced\norbit parameters are shown in Table 3.5.\n\nIt can be known from Table 3.5 that the inclination a is close to 0. From\nEq. (3.87), it can be seen that if a \u00bc 0 is to be achieved, then x \u00bc x?, or r \u00bc rGEO\nis necessary. If we substitute the above results into Eq. (3.87) and Eq. (3.88), the\nfollowing can be obtained:\n\ntan a \u00bc 0 \u00f03:91\u00de\n\na \u00bc hx2? \u00bc\nlh\nr3GEO\n\n\u00f03:92\u00de\n\nThis is called the INKO and the details are shown in Fig. 3.41. Compared with\nTable 3.5, this orbit needs smaller angular velocity. For example, as to the\nmigration height of 150 km, the maximum of the acceleration needed is only\n6:3? 10?4 m/s2.\n\nTable 3.5 Corresponding\nminimum acceleration of\ndifferent migration heights\n\nh (km) q (km) a (\u00b0) a (mm/s2)\n\n\u00b135 42,164.165 0.0476 0.1861\n\n\u00b175 42,164.147 0.1019 0.3988\n\n\u00b1150 42,164.080 0.2038 0.7976\n\nFig. 3.41 Displaced orbit deviating from orbit plane (out-of-plane) and displaced orbit in orbit\nplane\n\n3.4 Design of Displaced Geostationary Orbit 87\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Displaced Orbit in Orbit Plane\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 3.41, in the displaced orbit in the orbit plane, h = 0. We\nsubstitute it into Eqs. (3.87) and (3.88) and obtain\n\na \u00bc ? 1\n2\np \u00f03:93\u00de\n\na \u00bc q x2GEO ? x2?\n? \t?? ?? \u00f03:94\u00de\n\nHere: x? \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nl=q3\n\np\n, q \u00bc rGEO \u00feDr and Dr are offsets, Dr\\0 corresponds to the\n\ninner side of the GEO and Dr[ 0 corresponds to the outer side of the GEO.\nBased on Eq. (3.93), it can be known that the acceleration needed is in the radial\n\ndirection and the direction of a depends on Dr, which means when a\\0, the\ndirection points to the Earth-center, otherwise the opposite.\n\n3.4.3 Energy Analysis of Orbit Displacement\n\nFor the above two displaced orbits, Fig. 3.40 can roughly tell the accelerations\nneeded to maintain the two orbits respectively. When we compare the offsets in the\nhorizontal plane and that in the orbit plane (along the direction of axis Z), we can\nfind that when the offsets are the same, the acceleration needed by the former is\nthree times of the latter. Besides, the acceleration needed by the displaced orbit of\nDr[ 0 is slightly superior to that of Dr\\0.\n\nIf three methods, i.e., impulse control, Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP), and the\nintegrated propulsion of SEP and solar sail, are adopted to achieve the displaced\norbit deviating from the orbit plane respectively, the control ability of the impulsive\ncontrol method will be poor. Even for the minimum offset of 35 km, the hold time\nwith this method will be no more than a few months. Therefore, in order to maintain\nthe displaced orbit for a few months to several years when the offsets are 150 and\n35 km, the SEP control method should be adopted. However, even though the\nmethod is adopted, if the spacecraft carries a payload of 100 kg, the hold time is\nonly a few years with a relatively small offset. If the solar sail is added to the SEP,\nthe SEP can work only at the time when the solar sail is not able to be used (for\nexample, the solar sail cannot provide the thrust facing to the sun). In this way, the\nfuels can be saved effectively and the lifetime of the spacecraft can be extended or\nthe payload can be increased.\n\nWith regard to the displaced orbit deviating from the orbit plane, the control\nforce provided by the solar sail is influenced by seasonal changes. As to the dis-\nplaced orbit with the migration position in the northern hemisphere, the control\neffect of the solar sail in winter is better; as to that in the southern hemisphere, the\ncontrol effect in summer is better. Hence, the displaced orbit can conduct two\n\n88 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nseasonal shifts, which are from north to south in spring and from south to north in\nfall as shown in Fig. 3.42.\n\nWe assume that the maximum thrust the SEP is able to provide is 0.2 N, m0 is\nthe initial mass of the spacecraft, Dd represents the distance restriction between the\nspacecraft and the GEO, then the mass of the propellant needed for the shift is\nshown in Table 3.6.\n\nFrom the above table, it can be known that the propellant needed for the seasonal\nshift is quite small, or can even be ignored. The consumption of the propellant is\ndependent on Dd.\n\nWhen the seasonal shift is adopted, the lifetime of the spacecraft, which uses\nsingle SEP thruster in the displaced orbit with a migration distance of 35 km and\ncarries a payload of 255\u2013487 kg, can be extended to 10\u201315 years, which is almost\n\nFig. 3.42 Seasonal shift of displaced orbit\n\nTable 3.6 Mass of\npropellant for seasonal shift of\ndisplaced orbit (g)\n\nm0/kg h0/km\n\n\u00b135 \u00b175 \u00b1150\n\n2912 1020 436\n\nDd/km 0 2.6 0.96 0.66\n\n5 243.0 52.6 20.1\n\n10 \u2013 123.3 42.1\n\n20 \u2013 \u2013 96.0\n\n35 \u2013 \u2013 227.4\n\nNote \u2014means the scheme is infeasible\n\n3.4 Design of Displaced Geostationary Orbit 89\n\n\n\nthe lifetime of the spacecraft in the GEO of today. And if the number of the SEP\nthruster is increased, the mass of the payload portable will rise greatly.\n\nAlso, these displaced orbits can be used for temporary missions, i.e., a spacecraft\ncan use the displaced orbit when conducting a certain mission and goes back to the\nGEO for free flight when the mission is completed.\n\n3.5 Summary\n\nThis chapter mainly studies the design and control method of the hovering orbit.\nFirst of all, the model of the fixed-point hovering orbit is studied through the\nmechanical analysis in physics and the approximate \u201ctwo-body problem\u201d method\nand two control methods, i.e., open-loop control and closed loop control, are\nprovided; secondly, the design and control method of the regional hovering orbit\nare discussed. The spatial configurations of four confined areas are established and\non this basis, the target orbit\u2019s in-plane and out-of-plane design constraints are\nanalyzed. Finally, the concept and design method of the displaced geostationary\norbit are elaborated on. The maintenances of the configuration of the displaced orbit\nin and out of the GEO plane are studied and the energy consumption of the two\ndisplaced orbits are analyzed.\n\n90 3 Theory and Design Method of Hovering Orbit\n\n\n\nChapter 4\nTheory and Design Method\nof Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\nA spiral cruising orbit is an orbit design method with reference to a target orbit.\nSpacecraft designed with this method can cruise around the target orbit in a spiral\nway. Therefore, with only one spacecraft, short-range and high-precision detection\nof all the spacecraft on the target orbit and the space environment can be achieved.\n\n4.1 Spiral Cruising Orbit: Concept\n\nSpace target surveillance and space environment monitoring are the basis of various\nspace activities. However, due to such reasons as the detection range and the\ndeployment position of a ground-based detection network, it is difficult to obtain\nhigh-precision detection of all the on-orbit spacecraft, especially that of the\nhigh-orbit spacecraft and their space environment.\n\nSpiral cruising orbit is a relative operation orbit with reference to a specific target\norbit or a certain arc section of a specific target orbit. Spacecraft operating in a spiral\ncruising orbit can conduct spiral cruising detection, even spiral round-trip detection,\nof multiple target spacecraft that are in the target orbit, thus obtaining those target\nspacecraft\u2019s detailed information in multiple perspectives, so as to perform detailed\nrecognition of a target spacecraft.\n\nSpiral cruising orbit, through designing orbit parameters such as eccentricity and\norbit inclination of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s orbit, enables the cruising spacecraft to\nmove relative to the target orbit in a way similar to spiral precession, thus forming a\nspiral flying-around relative orbit configuration. Figure 4.1 shows the typical\nconfiguration of a spiral cruising orbit.\n\nThe mathematical expression of spiral cruising orbit is shown in Table 4.1, in\nwhich the first three entries are descriptions about the target orbit of the cruise, its\narc sections and key targets in these sections, which are also the basis for the design\nof a spiral cruising orbit in the future; the last five entries are descriptions about the\ndesign parameters of a spiral cruising orbit.\n\n\u00a9 National Defense Industry Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017\nY.

The initial phase directly determines\nthe angles formed among the cruising spacecraft, the target spacecraft and the Sun\n\nFig. 4.1 Configuration of spiral cruising orbit\n\nTable 4.1 Description parameters of spiral cruising orbit\n\nNumber Parameter name Specific descriptions\n\n1 Target orbit Orbit element of target orbit\n\n2 Cruising orbit\narc section\n\nArc range of cruising target orbit\n\n3 Key target\nsequence\n\nKey target sequence to be detected on the target orbit\n\n4 Cruising\ndirection\n\nPositive direction: cruising direction is the same as the\ndirection of the target spacecraft\nReverse direction: cruising direction is the opposite of the\ndirection of the target spacecraft\nRound-trip: cruising spacecraft taking round-trip cruising on a\nspecific arc of the target orbit\n\n5 Cruising\nvelocity\n\nCruised radian per unit time\n\n6 Cruising radius Maximum distance between the cruising orbit\u2019s projection in\nthe target orbit plane and the target orbit\n\n7 Cruising\ninclination\n\nInclination of the cruising orbit relative to the target orbit plane\n\n8 Initial phase Initial position of the cruising spacecraft in the target orbit\nplane\n\n92 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nat the observation moment, thus determining whether the exploratory conditions of\nthe payload in visible light are met.\n\nAccording to differences in cruising height, cruising radius, cruising direction,\nand the cruising path, spiral cruising orbits can be classified in multiple ways\n(Fig. 4.2):\n\n(1) According to the orbit altitude of the reference orbit (or target orbit), there are\nhigh-orbit cruising orbits and Low-Earth-Orbit cruising orbits;\n\n(2) According to the size of the cruising radius (with satellite warning distance as\nthe separatrix), there are remote cruising orbit and short-range cruising orbit;\n\n(3) Depending on whether the cruising direction is the same as the direction of the\ntarget orbit, there are along-track cruising orbit and cross-track cruising orbit;\n\n(4) According to different cruising paths, there are traversal cruising orbit,\nround-trip itinerant orbit, and controllable cruising orbit, etc.\n\nTwo concepts are defined in the first place to describe the configuration of a\nspiral cruising orbit:\n\n(1) Aiming point: it is the point where the spiral cruising orbit\u2019s trajectory\nintersects with itself. It is known from the spiral cruising orbit configuration\nthat within one period, the operation trajectory of the platform and its previous\ncruising path will have at least one intersection point, which is defined as the\naiming point.\n\n(2) Spiral ring: it is the path of the platform as it passes the same aiming point\ntwice during spiral cruising, which is a closed annular relative motion\ntrajectory.\n\nThe schematic figure of the aiming point and the spiral ring is shown in Fig. 4.3.\n\nFig. 4.2 Classification of spiral cruising orbits\n\n4.1 Spiral Cruising Orbit: Concept 93\n\n\n\n4.2 Precision Analysis of Relative Motion Model\n\nThe relative motion dynamics method derives from the basic motion equations\ndescribed by the absolute motion vectors of a spacecraft. Its study emphasizes\nsolving the nonlinear relative motion differential equations expressed in the target\norbit coordinate system. Relative motion dynamics has been well-studied by\nscholars both at home and abroad. This section starts with the accurate relative\nmotion dynamics equation, and through reasonable hypotheses, obtains the relative\nmotion dynamics model of a cruising spacecraft.\n\n4.2.1 Accurate Relative Motion Dynamics Equation\n\nThe motion law of the cruising spacecraft relative to the target satellite can be\ndescribed by a relative motion dynamics equation. We can suppose that~r1 and~r2\nare the position vectors of the target satellite and the cruising spacecraft in the Earth\ncentered inertial system, respectively, the relative position vector of the cruising\nspacecraft relative to the target satellite in the Earth centered inertial system is:\n\n~r \u00bc~r2 ?~r1 \u00f04:1\u00de\n\nIt is known that the dynamics equations of the target satellite and the cruising\nspacecraft in the Earth centered inertial system are:\n\n~r1 \u00bc ? l~r1r31 \u00fe~ap;1 \u00fe~ac;1\n~r2 \u00bc ? l~r2r32 \u00fe~ap;2 \u00fe~ac;2\n\n8<\n: \u00f04:2\u00de\n\nFig. 4.3 Schematic figure of aiming point and spiral ring\n\n94 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nHere, r1 and r2 stand for the instantaneous geocentric distances of the target\nsatellite and the cruising spacecraft, respectively;~ap;1 and~ap;2 stand for the sum of\nall perturbation forces (except earth\u2019s gravity) of the target satellite and the cruising\nspacecraft, respectively; and~ac;1,~ac;2 stand for the sum of controlling accelerations\nof the target satellite and the cruising spacecraft, respectively.\n\nTherefore, in the Earth centered inertial system, the relative motion dynamics\nequation of the cruising spacecraft relative to the target satellite is:\n\n\u20ac~r \u00bc \u20ac~r2 ? \u20ac~r1 \u00bc ?l ~r2r32\n?~r1\nr31\n\n? ?\n\u00feD~ap \u00feD~ac \u00f04:3\u00de\n\nIn the equation, D~ap \u00bc~ap;2 ?~ap;1 and D~ac \u00bc~ac;2 ?~ac;1 stand for the difference\nbetween perturbation forces and the difference between control forces exerted on\nthe cruising spacecraft and the target satellite, respectively.\n\nIf the relative motion dynamics equation in the Earth centered inertial system is\nconverted into the target orbital coordinate system, then:\n\n\u20ac~r\u00fe 2~w? _~r\u00fe~w? ~w?~r\u00f0 \u00de\u00fe _~w?~r \u00bc ?l ~r2\nr32\n\n?~r1\nr31\n\n? ?\n\u00feD~ap \u00feD~ac \u00f04:4\u00de\n\nHere, ~w \u00bc 0 0 _m\u00bd ?T stands for the rotational angular velocity vector of the\ntarget orbital coordinate system relative to the Earth centered inertial system\ndescribed in the target orbital coordinate system.\n\nIf the position vector of the target satellite is ~r1 \u00bc r1 0 0\u00bd ?T , the relative\nposition vector is ~r \u00bc x y z\u00bd ?T , then the position vector of the cruising space-\ncraft is:\n\n~r2 \u00bc r1 \u00fe x y z\u00bd ?T \u00f04:5\u00de\n\nThe tangential velocity of the target satellite Vf is:\n\nVf \u00bc r1 ? _m \u00bc\nffiffiffi\nl\np\n\nr\n1\u00fe e cos m\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:6\u00de\n\nThen l can be expressed as follows:\n\nl \u00bc r\n3\n1 _m\n\n2\n\n1\u00fe e cos m \u00f04:7\u00de\n\nWhen we substitute Eq.

Through precision analysis of the model, the cruising spacecraft\u2019s relative\nmotion dynamics model that meets the orbit design requirement will be confirmed.\n\nAs the relative motion error is mainly reflected by the along-track drift error of\nthe target satellite, selections of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s initial relative motion state\nrelative to the target satellite are shown in Table 4.2, with a 4-day simulation time.\n\n98 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nThe motion trajectory of the cruising spacecraft relative to the target satellite\nwithin 4 days is as Fig. 4.4 shows. It can be seen that the motion trajectories\nadopting different relative motion dynamics models have all matched well.\n\nIn Fig. 4.5a\u2013d, the first-order and second-order relative motion dynamics models\nare compared with the accurate dynamics model. It is shown that the relative\ntrajectory errors in radial direction and normal direction are very small (less than\n40 m), and the major errors mainly occur on the along-track drift of the target orbit\n(about 200 m). For the cruising orbit, however, in order to cruise, along-track drift\nis usually needed. Therefore, by adopting the first-order relative motion dynamics\nmodel, requirements for the cruising mission of the cruising spacecraft can be met.\n\n4.2.4 Analysis of Relative Motion Dynamics Model\nof Cruising Spacecraft\n\nAs it meets the orbit design requirements of the cruising spacecraft and has direct\nanalytical solution, the precision of the first-order linear dynamics model has great\nadvantages in the configuration of a relative orbit design.\n\nTable 4.2 Initial relative state parameters of cruising spacecraft\n\nx0 (m) y0 (m) z0 (m) _x0 (m/s) _y0 (m/s) _z0 (m/s)\n\n1 2001 1 7.2922e?6 0.0401 1\n\nFig. 4.4 Relative motion trajectories\n\n4.2 Precision Analysis of Relative Motion Model 99\n\n\n\n\u20acx? 2n _y? 3n2x? acx \u00bc 0\n\u20acy\u00fe 2n_x? acy \u00bc 0\n\u20acz\u00fe n2z? acz \u00bc 0\n\n8<\n: \u00f04:20\u00de\n\nIn the condition of non-control, the equations above are turned into the classical\nC-W Equations, also known as Hill Equation.\n\n\u20acx? 2n_y? 3n2x \u00bc 0\n\u20acy\u00fe 2n _x \u00bc 0\n\u20acz\u00fe n2z \u00bc 0\n\n8<\n: \u00f04:21\u00de\n\nWith Laplace transformation, the following can be obtained:\n\ns2X\u00f0s\u00de ? sx0 ? _x0\u00bd ? ? 2n sY\u00f0s\u00de ? y0\u00bd ? ? 3n2X\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc 0\n\u00bds2Y\u00f0s\u00de ? sy0 ? _y0? \u00fe 2n\u00bdsX\u00f0s\u00de ? x0? \u00bc 0\n\u00bds2Z\u00f0s\u00de ? sz0 ? _z0? \u00fe n2Z\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc 0\n\n8<\n: \u00f04:22\u00de\n\nFig. 4.5 Comparison in precision between different models\n\n100 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nHere, \u00f0x0; y0; z0; _x0; _y0; _z0\u00de stands for the initial relative motion state of the\ncruising spacecraft in the orbital coordinate system of the target satellite.\n\nWhen we transform the equation above to matrix form, the result is:\n\ns2 ? 3n2 ?2ns 0\n2ns s2 0\n0 0 s2 \u00fe n2\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 X\u00f0s\u00deY\u00f0s\u00de\n\nZ\u00f0s\u00de\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00bc sx0 \u00fe _x0 ? 2ny0sy0 \u00fe _y0 ? 2nx0\n\nsz0 \u00fe _z0\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f04:23\u00de\n\nThen,\n\nX\u00f0s\u00de\n\nY\u00f0s\u00de\n\nZ\u00f0s\u00de\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775 \u00bc\n\n\u00f0x0?2 _y0 \u00fe 4nx0n \u00des\ns2 \u00fe n2 \u00fe\n\n\u00f0_x0n \u00den\ns2 \u00fe n2 \u00fe 2 _y0 \u00fe 4nx0n 1s\n\n2\u00f0 _x0n \u00des\ns2 \u00fe n2 \u00fe\n\n2\u00f02 _y0 \u00fe 4nx0n ?x0\u00den\ns2 \u00fe n2 ? 3n2 2 _y0 \u00fe 4nx0n 1s2 \u00fe ny0?2 _x0n 1s\n\nz0s\ns2 \u00fe n2 \u00fe\n\n\u00f0_z0n \u00den\ns2 \u00fe n2\n\n2\n6666664\n\n3\n7777775\n\n\u00f04:24\u00de\n\nWith Laplace inverse transformation, the following can be obtained:\n\nx\u00f0t\u00de\ny\u00f0t\u00de\nz\u00f0t\u00de\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00bc\n\nx0 ? 2 _y0 \u00fe 4nx0n\n? ?\n\ncos nt\u00fe _x0n sin nt\u00fe 2_y0 \u00fe 4nx0n\n2 _x0\nn cos nt\u00fe 2 2 _y0 \u00fe 4nx0n ? x0\n\n? ?\nsin nt ? 3n2 2 _y0 \u00fe 4nx0n t\u00fe ny0?2 _x0n\n\nz0 cos nt\u00fe _z0n sin nt\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775 \u00f04:25\u00de\n\nIf we take the derivative of Eq.

As it is hard to ensure a proper surveillance angle for every\ntarget during traversal cruising, in designing a spiral traversal cruising orbit, only\nthe design constraint of the cruising radius and the cruising velocity should be\nfocused on.\n\n(1) Constraint on cruising radius\n\nAs for the constraint on the cruising radius, the operating range of the surveil-\nlance payload on the cruising spacecraft is a main consideration; another consid-\neration is the responsive ability requirement of the cruising spacecraft.\n\nThe selection range of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s cruising radius is related to the\nperformance of the CCD visible light camera on it; the effective surveillance range\nof the camera cannot exceed the maximum operating range of the payload itself.\nTherefore the working radius of the visible light camera can be described as:\n\n4.3 Traversal Cruising Orbit: Design 107\n\n\n\nR1 \u00bc RdD2:44kQ \u00f04:49\u00de\n\nHere, D is the size of the optical aperture of the visible light camera; k is the\nworking wavelength of the camera (the wavelength range of the visible light wave\nband is 0.4\u20130.7 lm); Q is the imaging quality factor; Rd is the minimum spatial\nresolution needed for achieving space target surveillance.\n\nIf the optical aperture of the CCD camera carried by the cruising spacecraft is\nD = 0.3 m, working wavelength k \u00bc 0:5 lm, imaging quality factor Q \u00bc 1:1, Rd \u00bc\n0:5 m then the maximum working distance is about 111.8 km.\n\nIf the cruising spacecraft is required to switch from the traversal cruising mode\nto other modes within a limited time, its responsive ability needs to meet certain\nrequirements. For instance, when the cruising spacecraft travels in the vicinity of a\nspecific target, in order to obtain detailed feature information of the target, it needs\nto quickly switch from the cruising mode to the small elliptical fly-around mode,\nthe fast circular fly-around mode, or other modes, so as to conduct omnidirectional\nsurveillance of the target. When the mission is accomplished, the cruising space-\ncraft needs to return to the cruising orbit to continue the collection of information\non other targets.\n\nWhen the cruising spacecraft rapidly approaches the vicinity of the target\nsatellite from a place where the distance to the target spacecraft is L, it is necessary\nto apply impulses at the initial time and the arrival time, respectively. The total\nvelocity increment to be consumed can be approximately described as (Fig. 4.8):\n\nFig. 4.8 Relations between responsive time and velocity increment required at different distances\n\n108 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nDV \u00bc 2 L\nDt\n\n\u00f04:50\u00de\n\nWhen we take into full consideration the limitation of available fuel of the\ncruising spacecraft every time it switches its cruising mode and the requirement for\nresponsive ability, the cruising radius R2 should meet the following condition:\n\nR\t 0:01H \u00f04:51\u00de\n\nHere, H is the orbit altitude of the target orbit.\nAs is known from Eq. (4.51), if the reference orbit is a geostationary earth orbit\n\n(GEO), then the cruising radius should be less than 360 km; if the orbit altitude of\nthe reference orbit is 20,000 km, then the cruising radius should be no more than\n200 km.\n\nIn summary, if the effective working range of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s\nsurveillance payload is R1, the constraint of the responsive ability on the cruising\nradius is R2, then the cruising radius of the cruising orbit is:\n\nR \u00bc min\u00f0R1;R2\u00de \u00f04:52\u00de\n\n(2) Constraint on cruising velocity\n\nTwo aspects need to be considered in designing cruising velocity: one is the\nrequirement of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s surveillance payload on cruising velocity;\nthe other is when the cruising radius is given, the constraint of the cruising orbit\nconfiguration on cruising velocity.\n\nAs the cruising spacecraft is a kind of small-sized spacecraft, the performance\nconfiguration of the surveillance payload it can carry is limited. We can suppose\nthat the surveillance payload is a CCD visible light camera. Generally, in order to\nensure clear imaging, the linear CCD photo sensor in the focal plane of the camera\nmust meet a certain exposure requirement. The exposure of the linear CCD photo\nsensor E (in W ? s) can be expressed as:\n\nE \u00bc PDti \u00f04:53\u00de\n\nHere: PD is the radiation flux of light received by the camera in W ; ti is the\nintegration time in s, which is related to the specific performance of the CCD\ncamera. To ensure that there is no omission in camera imaging, the following\nshould be satisfied:\n\nti \t rg\n\t\nvg \u00f04:54\u00de\n\nHere: rg is the relative distance between the two spacecraft, and vg is the relative\nvelocity between them.\n\n4.3 Traversal Cruising Orbit: Design 109\n\n\n\nThe cruising radius and the cruising velocity are both the functions of the\nrelative position velocity; and there exists a coupling relation between the two.\nWhen the cruising radius R is given, if a spiral cruising orbit configuration is to be\nmaintained, the cruising velocity V cannot be infinitely large. The relation between\nthe cruising velocity and the cruising radius is:\n\nR \u00bc b\u00fe 2\n3n\n\nV\n\n????\n???? \u00f04:55\u00de\n\nHere, refer to Eq. (4.34) for the definition of b.\nIt can be seen that when the cruising radius R is fixed, as b deceases, the value of\n\n2\n3n V\n?? ?? increases and thus the cruising velocity V also increases. In limiting cases,\nwhen b \u00bc 0, the cruising velocity reaches its maximum value. At this moment, the\nspiral cruising orbit degrades into a linear cruising orbit. Hence, the cruising\nvelocity of a spiral traversal cruising orbit must meet the following constraint:\n\nVj j \t 3\n2\nnR \u00f04:56\u00de\n\nBased on Eq. (4.56), the value range of the cruising velocity V, changing with\nthe cruising radius R, can be obtained. An example is presented below. When the\ntarget orbit is a GEO, the relation between the cruising velocity and the cruising\nradius is analyzed. It is shown in Fig. 4.9.\n\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 4.9, the higher the cruising velocity is, the larger the\ncorresponding cruising radius will be. This means enhancing the responsive ability\nof the cruising spacecraft can be achieved at the cost of some surveillance effect.\nTherefore, in designing a spiral cruising orbit, indexes of the two sides must be\nbalanced so as to achieve an optimal overall effect.\n\n4.3.4 Simulation Analysis\n\nWe can suppose that the target orbit is a GEO, and the six elements of the reference\ntarget spacecraft are: a \u00bc 42164 km, e \u00bc 0, i \u00bc 0?, X \u00bc 0?, w \u00bc 0?, and M \u00bc 0?.\nWe can set the cruising radius R \u00bc 100 km, the cruising velocity V = 4 m/s; we can\nalso set the initial phase angle of the cruising spacecraft in the target orbit plane\nh \u00bc ?90?, and the initial angle in the normal direction u \u00bc 0? . It can be calculated\nthat the position vector and the velocity vector of the cruising spacecraft in the\nEarth centered inertial coordinate system are:\n\n~r \u00bc\n42164:1\n103:269\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 km ~v \u00bc ?0:003754973:07319\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 km=s\n\n110 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nThe STK software is used to simulate the spiral traversal cruising orbit of the\nspacecraft. It is shown in Fig. 4.10.\n\nIn Fig. 4.10, the orbit in the middle is the GEO, i.e., the target orbit; parallel to\nthe GEO, the two orbits on the top and at the bottom are orbits that are 100 km\nhigher and 100 km lower than the GEO, respectively; the spiral-shaped orbit in the\nmiddle is the traversal cruising orbit.\n\nFigure 4.11 shows the changes of the relative distance between the cruising\nspacecraft and the target orbit in 60 days. As is known from the figure, the cruising\nradius is within the 100 km distance range required in the design. In this case, the\ncruising spacecraft can stay in the vicinity of the target orbit for a long time, and can\nconduct close reconnaissance on and surveillance of all the spacecraft in the target\norbit.\n\nFig. 4.9 Value range of cruising velocity changing with cruising radius\n\nFig. 4.10 Spiral traversal cruising orbit\n\n4.3 Traversal Cruising Orbit: Design 111\n\n\n\nWe can take a target satellite in the GEO as an example. The abilities of the\nspiral cruising orbit is explored in three aspects\u2014the change of distance relative to\nthe target, the observation session, and the observation angle. The simulation result\nis shown in Fig. 4.12.\n\nFigure 4.12 shows the variation curve of the relative distance between the\ncruising spacecraft and the target spacecraft. It can be seen that the general variation\ntendency of their relative distance is that the cruising spacecraft slowly approaches\nthe target at first and then gradually moves away from it, without staying in the\nvicinity of the target for a long time. Therefore it enjoys a high quality of\nconcealment.\n\nFig. 4.11 Relative distance between cruising spacecraft and target orbit (in 60 days)\n\nFig. 4.12 Distance between cruising spacecraft and target spacecraft\n\n112 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13 shows the time distribution of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s surveillance\nof the target spacecraft. As is known from the figure, there are two surveillance\nperiods: the first one is [3 Jul 2007 00:20:18.255\u20133 Jul 2007 09:52:55.208], lasting\n9.54 h; the second one is [3 Jul 2007 15:38:12.678\u20133 Jul 2007 20:00:09.206],\nlasting 4.36 h. The total effective surveillance time of the cruising spacecraft of the\ntarget is about 13.9 h, suggesting that the cruising spacecraft can conduct long-time\nsurveillance of a specific target.\n\nFigure 4.14 shows the variation curve of the observation angle of the cruising\nspacecraft relative to the target spacecraft. As is known from the figure, the\nobservation angle of the cruising spacecraft relative to the target spacecraft varies\nwithin a range of ?90\u00b0\u20135\u00b0, indicating that the observation angle of the cruising\nspacecraft is large and that the target is comprehensively observed.\n\nFig. 4.13 Time period of cruising spacecraft\u2019s surveillance of target spacecraft\n\nFig. 4.14 Observation angle of cruising spacecraft relative to target spacecraft\n\n4.3 Traversal Cruising Orbit: Design 113\n\n\n\nThe time needed for a cruising spacecraft to complete a traversal observation of\nall the spacecraft in the GEO is:\n\nT \u00bc 2paT=V ? 768 days\n\nClose-range traversal research on all the spacecraft in the target orbit can be\nachieved by spiral traversal cruising; and a favorable effect can be achieved on the\nsurveillance of multiple targets. Theoretically speaking, if the cruising mode does\nnot change and effects of factors such as perturbation on the cruising orbit con-\nfiguration can be neglected, in the process of traversal cruising, the cruising\nspacecraft does not need to consume fuel, and its operation life is quite long. In\nspiral traversal cruising, in addition, the traversal period for a high-orbit target is\nrelatively long. Therefore, it is more suitable for long-term on-orbit space target\nsurveillance.\n\n4.4 Design of the Round-Trip Itinerant Orbit\n\nA round-trip itinerant orbit is a spiral-shaped relative orbit along which a spacecraft\nconducts multi-frequency round-trip surveillance of the target group within a\nspecific arc section of the target orbit. By exerting orbit control on the cruising\nspacecraft from the boundary of the target group, the direction of the spiral cruise is\nchanged, generally presenting a closed spiral round-trip fly-around configuration as\nFig. 4.15 shows.\n\nSimilar to the spiral traversal cruising orbit, in designing a spiral round-trip\ncruising orbit, such requirements as cruising range, observation ability and on-orbit\nworking life also need to be taken into consideration.\n\n4.4.1 Design Method\n\nIn designing a spiral round-trip cruising orbit, firstly, the target set is precisely\ndescribed and the cruising range is defined; next, for the spiral round-trip cruising\norbit configuration itself, the cruising velocity and the cruising radius are designed.\n\nFig. 4.15 Spiral round-trip cruising orbit\n\n114 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nWith regard to target groups in the same orbit, a certain satellite can be taken as\nthe reference. With relative state parameters, the target set can be described as:\n\nrj;DL1;DL2; . . .;DLn\n? ?\n\nHere, rj is the orbit element of the reference target j; DLn is the relative motion\nstate parameter of target n in the orbital coordinate system of target j.\n\nIf the target orbit is a GEO, and compared to the radius of the GEO, the distance\nbetween two adjacent targets is an infinitesimal amount, then the following\napproximation can be obtained:\n\nyc0i \u00bc yc0j \u00fe\u00f0Li ? Lj\u00deR \u00f04:57\u00de\n\nHere, yc0i and yc0j stand for the positions of targets i and j in the reference\ncoordinate system, respectively; Li and Lj stand for the geographic longitudes of\ntarget satellites i and j, respectively; R is the semi-major axis of the target orbit.\n\nThe starting point ys and the terminal point ye of the spiral round-trip cruising\norbit can be approximately determined by the relative position of the target satellites\nat the two ends of the target set. We suppose that the distance between the target\nsatellites at both ends is DLmax, then the round-trip distance DL can be approxi-\nmately obtained:\n\nDL \u00bc 2 ye ? ysj j \u00bc 2DLmax \u00f04:58\u00de\n\nAccording to the relative motion dynamics model, the drift distance d for a\ncruising spacecraft in one orbital period is:\n\nd \u00bc 3pxc0 \u00f04:59\u00de\n\nThen the time needed to complete one period of a spiral round-trip cruising can\nbe approximated to the number of orbital period as:\n\nTgo \u00bc DLd \u00f04:60\u00de\n\nBased on the requirements of the spiral round-trip cruising model, the cruising\ndirection of a cruising spacecraft can be divided into two types: positive and\nreverse. We suppose that the cruising distances in both directions are the same in\neach period, and that orbit switch is only conducted on the boundary of the target\ngroup without exerting any other control during the cruising process. It is known\nfrom the relative motion characteristics of the cruising spacecraft that, its cruising\ndirection is related to the sign of xc0: when xc0\\0, it is cruising in the positive\ndirection; when xc0 [ 0, it is cruising in the reverse direction. Therefore, the\ncruising spacecraft switches its cruising direction mainly via orbit control and\nchanging the value of xc0 as Fig. 4.16 shows.\n\n4.4 Design of the Round-Trip Itinerant Orbit 115\n\n\n\nAfter the transformation, xc0 can be described as:\n\nxc0 \u00bc 2_y0 \u00fe 4nx0n \u00f04:61\u00de\n\nWe suppose that the cruising spacecraft switches every time at the point where\nx0 \u00bc 0 (according to the relative motion characteristics of the cruising spacecraft,\nthat point always exists), then the following can be obtained:\n\n_y0 \u00bc 12 nxc0 \u00f04:62\u00de\n\nIf, during every switch, only the cruising direction of the cruising spacecraft is\nchanged while its cruising distance in every period remains the same, then it is\nknown from the relative motion dynamics model of the cruising spacecraft that it\nonly needs to apply along-track impulse control to the cruising spacecraft to change\nthe sign of _y0 without changing its value. Thus the following can be obtained:\n\nPositive direction cruising switch : DV1 \u00bc nxc0\nReverse direction cruising switch : DV2 \u00bc ?nxc0\n\n\n ?\n\u00f04:63\u00de\n\nIn one spiral round-trip cruising period, switches in both directions need to be\nconducted. Therefore, the total velocity increment required in each cruising period\nis:\n\nDVtotal \u00bc 2DV \u00bc 2nd3p \u00f04:64\u00de\n\nIt can be seen that the larger the drift distance d is, the greater the velocity\nincrement is required to complete a round-trip cruising period. Figure 4.17 shows\nthe relation between the drift distance of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s relative motion\ntrajectory in each period and the velocity increment.\n\nFig. 4.16 Direction switch of spiral round-trip cruising\n\n116 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Design Constraints\n\nA spiral round-trip cruising orbit is, on the basis of a spiral traversal cruising orbit, a\nclosed relative motion trajectory formed by constantly exerting control on the\nboundary of the target group and changing the direction of the spiral cruise. As a\nresult, the general constraints on designing a spiral traversal cruising orbit also need\nto be taken into consideration in designing a spiral round-trip cruising orbit.\n\nDifferent from the spiral traversal cruising orbit, in designing a spiral round-trip\ncruising orbit, the constraint of the responsive ability on the orbit design is twofold:\none is the constraint of responsive time when the cruising spacecraft switches its\ncruising mode, i.e., the design constraint of the cruising radius should be consid-\nered; the other is, in a round-trip cruise, the time interval between two adjacent\nreconnaissance by the cruising spacecraft on the same target in a round-trip cruise,\nor the requirement for the frequency of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s surveillance of the\nsame target in a period of time, i.e., the design constraint on the size of the cruising\nrange of the cruising spacecraft should be considered.\n\nFig. 4.17 Relation between drift distance and velocity increment per period\n\n4.4 Design of the Round-Trip Itinerant Orbit 117\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Simulation Analysis\n\nIn this section, three target satellites (Sat1, Sat2, Sat3) are taken as an example to\ndesign a spiral round-trip cruising orbit. A target orbital coordinate system is cre-\nated with Sat1 as the origin. The target group is described as:\n\n0; 1:4e\u00fe 003 km; 2:3e\u00fe 003 kmf g\n\nIt can be approximately determined that:\n\nys \u00bc 0 ye \u00bc 2:3e\u00fe 003 km\n\nIf the maximum cruising radius of the cruising spacecraft is 120 km, then it is\nknown from Eq. (4.60) that the maximum drift distance of the cruising spacecraft\nper day is dmax \u00bc 753:98 km. If we set d = 700 km, the round-trip period T is:\n\nT [ 2INT\u00f0 yej j\nd\n\u00de ) T [ 2INT\u00f03:3519\u00de\n\nIf we set eight days as the round-trip period T , then:\n\nT \u00bc 8 day; d \u00bc 586:5750 km; xc0 \u00bc 62:2375 km\n\nIt is known from Fig. 4.18 that the relative motion trajectory of the cruising\nspacecraft is a closed curve consisting of eight drifting ellipses, and that the cruising\nspacecraft takes round-trip cruises among the three target satellites, with a\nround-trip period of eight days.\n\nFigures 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21 are the change curves of the relative distances\nbetween the cruising spacecraft and the three target satellites in one cruising period,\nrespectively. It can be seen that, the distance between the cruising spacecraft and the\ntarget satellite changes periodically with time. In the figures, the value at the dotted\nline is 120 km, meaning the farthest point at which a cruising spacecraft can per-\nform detailed observation of the target. It is known from the simulation result that in\na spiral round-trip cruise, there always exists a certain period of time when the\ncruising spacecraft can perform short-range surveillance of the three satellites.\n\nFigure 4.22 shows the change curve of the relative distance between the cruising\nspacecraft and the target orbit.\n\nIt is known from Fig. 4.22 that the relative distance between the cruising\nspacecraft and the target orbit is always within 120 km, suggesting that in the\nprocess of a spiral round-trip, the cruising spacecraft can also perform short-range\nsurveillance of other spacecraft in the same arc section.\n\nThe drift distance of the cruising spacecraft per day is 586.6 km. It is known\nfrom Eq. (4.28) that in each period the velocity increment needed for the cruising\nspacecraft to switch is 9.1 m/s.\n\n118 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nFig. 4.18 Spiral round-trip cruising trajectory of cruising spacecraft\n\nFig. 4.19 Change curve of relative distance between cruising spacecraft and Sat1\n\n4.4 Design of the Round-Trip Itinerant Orbit 119\n\n\n\nFig. 4.20 Change curve of relative distance between cruising spacecraft and Sat2\n\nFig. 4.21 Change curve of relative distance between cruising spacecraft and Sat3\n\n120 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nThe spiral round-trip cruising method can achieve multi-frequency and\nshort-range round-trip inspection of the target group in the target orbit region. When\nthe round-trip region is relatively small, its round-trip period is relatively short, and\nthe responsive ability is very good. However, orbit control is only applied to the\nboundary of the target and no control adjustment is conducted during the process.\nTherefore, with regard to a group of evenly distributed targets, a favorable\nsurveillance effect of every satellite by the cruising spacecraft can be achieved by\nthe reasonable design of the cruising orbit; as for a group of unevenly distributed\ntargets, the cruising spacecraft can only guarantee the intensive surveillance of a\nfew targets in the region, while having difficulty in ensuring the surveillance effect\nof other targets.\n\n4.5 Controllable Cruising Orbit: Design\n\nDue to influences from factors such as the unevenness in the distribution of space\ntargets and orbit perturbation, it is difficult to obtain the ideal space target\nsurveillance effect by a single orbit configuration. For this purpose, this section will\npropose a controlled cruising method.\n\nThe controllable orbit design combines relative orbit with absolute orbit and\napplies the method of multiple orbit planning. The goal of the design is, in the\nprocess of a spiral motion (one positive direction or reverse direction cruise), the\n\nFig. 4.22 Change curve of relative distance between cruising spacecraft and target orbit\n\n4.4 Design of the Round-Trip Itinerant Orbit 121\n\n\n\ncruising spacecraft can conduct at least one or even multiple omnidirectional\nsurveillance of every target of the target group. This is shown in Fig. 4.23.\n\nBy adjusting the cruising velocity of the spiral round-trip orbit and the config-\nuration of relative drifting elliptical trajectory, etc., every target is able to be kept on\nthe fly-around trajectory of the spiral round-trip cruising orbit, thus enabling the\ncruising spacecraft in spiral motion to detect the target satellite at short range.\nAdditionally, in order to guarantee the stability of the imaging quality of the target\nsatellite, we should try our best to ensure that the target satellite is at the center of\nthe spiral fly-around region or in its vicinity so as to obtain the stable imaging\neffect.\n\n4.5.1 Spiral Ring: Design\n\nWe suppose that the number of target satellites needed to be monitored is N. When\nthe cruising spacecraft travels to the vicinity of target satellite i, if short-range\nfly-around observation is to be performed on the target satellite, then the relative\ntrajectory should meet the following constraint conditions:\n\n(1) The fly-around trajectory cannot enter the safety zone of the target satellite\n(i.e., the flight forbidden zone) to avoid collision;\n\n(2) The fly-around trajectory cannot exceed the effective action range of the\nimaging payload of the cruising spacecraft.\n\nWe suppose that the radius of the target satellite\u2019s flight forbidden zone is r1, and\nthe effective action distance of the platform\u2019s imaging payload is r2. In a target\nsatellite orbital coordinate system, we can set the position of the aiming point as x0,\nas Fig. 4.24 shows.\n\nAccording to the constraint conditions, the following can be obtained:\n\nr1 \t x0j j \t r2 \u00f04:65\u00de\n\nIf at moment t0, the position of aiming point A, i.e., xt0 , and the fly-around time\nT (T is the fly-around time of the spiral ring, less than or equal to the orbital period\n\nFig. 4.23 Controllable spiral orbit\n\n122 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nof the target satellite) are given, by using the dynamics model to perform orbit\nextrapolation, the spiral ring trajectory of the cruising spacecraft can be obtained.\nThe maximum relative distance between the cruising spacecraft and the aiming\npoint appears at the moment when t \u00bc t0 \u00fe 0:5T , and\n\nhmax \u00bc xt0 \u00fe 0:5T ? xt0j j \u00f04:66\u00de\n\nHere, hmax stands for the farthest distance between the cruising spacecraft and\nthe aiming point in the spiral ring. Therefore, for the minimum spiral ring, the\nfollowing constraint should be met:\n\nh\n x0j j \u00fe r1 \u00f04:67\u00de\n\nAs for the maximum spiral ring, the following constraint should be met:\n\nh\t x0j j \u00fe r2 \u00f04:68\u00de\n\nThe algorithm used to obtain the fly-around time constraint is a dichotomy that\nsolves the nonlinear equation. The flowchart is in Fig. 4.25.\n\nWe suppose that the target orbit is a GEO, the effective action distance of the\ncruising spacecraft with payload is 120 km. Figure 4.26 shows, when the target\nflight forbidden zones are 100, 500 m, 2, 10, 30, 50 km, respectively, the change\ncurves of the minimum fly-around time as it changes with the position distribution\nof the aiming point.\n\nWe can take Fig. 4.26a as an example. If the peak of the fly-around approaches\nthe forbidden zone of the target satellite from the radial distance, then the minimum\n\nFig. 4.24 Schematic figure of round-trip imaging trajectory constraint\n\n4.5 Controllable Cruising Orbit: Design 123\n\n\n\nfly-around period is about 24 h; if the radial distance of the fly-around peak is\n120 km from the target satellite, the minimum fly-around period is about 9.7 h.\n\nWith different position distributions of the aiming point, the variation tendency\nof the minimum fly-around configuration is shown in Fig. 4.27, in which the for-\nbidden zone of the target is 50 km, the minimum fly-around times are 23.9344,\n18.1850, and 15.7811 h, respectively.\n\nIt can be seen that, when the effective action distance of the cruising spacecraft\nwith payload is given, the shorter the radius of the target forbidden zone, the larger\nthe distance between the position of the aiming point and the target, then the less the\nminimum fly-around time; the longer the radius of the target forbidden zone,\nthe smaller the distance between the position of the aiming point and the target, then\nthe more the minimum fly-around time. In extreme cases, when the aiming point is\non the boundary of the target forbidden zone, the minimum fly-around time reaches\nits maximum value, which is also one orbital period of the target orbit.\n\n4.5.2 Entry Corridor: Design\n\nThe goal in designing an entry corridor is to enable the cruising spacecraft to\nperform omnidirectional observation of the target satellite in its vicinity in a natural\nspiral fly-around way. It therefore does not require extra orbit control.\n\nFig. 4.25 Flow chart of minimum flight period\n\n124 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\n(a) Radius of the target forbidden zone 100m (b) Radius of the target forbidden zone 500m\n\n(c) Radius of the target forbidden zone 2km (d) Radius of the target forbidden zone 10km\n\n(e) Radius of the target forbidden zone 30km (f) Radius of the target forbidden zone 50km\n\nFig. 4.26 Change curve of minimum fly-around time with changes in flight forbidden zones and\nposition distribution of aiming point\n\n4.5 Controllable Cruising Orbit: Design 125\n\n\n\nWhen the cruising spacecraft performs fly-around observation of the target\nsatellite, its relative distance cannot exceed the working range of its payload; its\nrelative motion trajectory cannot enter the forbidden zones of the target satellite in\norder to avoid collision. Therefore, when the cruising spacecraft performs spiral\nfly-around surveillance of a certain target satellite, besides the constraint on the\npeak of the relative position of the spiral fly-around, its relative initial velocity at the\npeak of the fly-around must enable the spiral fly-around trajectory of the cruising\nspacecraft to meet the constraint conditions.\n\nHence, the spiral fly-around surveillance by the cruising spacecraft of the target\nsatellite is an initial state set of position and velocity, i.e., the \u201centry corridor\u201d. After\nthe cruising spacecraft completes its surveillance mission of target satellite i? 1,\nplanning of surveillance of target satellite i will begin. In approaching target\nsatellite i, once the cruising spacecraft captures the \u201centry corridor\u201d of target\nsatellite i, it will be able to complete a comprehensive fly-around surveillance of\ntarget satellite i with a natural relative fly-around.\n\nThe entry corridor can be described as:\n\nSi \u00bc [ ~rj; [ \u00f0~vk\u00de\n? ?\n\nst\nx2i \u00f0tj\u00de\u00fe y2i \u00f0tj\u00de\n r2jinqu\nx2i \u00f0tj\u00de\u00fe y2i \u00f0tj\u00de\t r2zaihe\n\n(\n\ntj 2 0; Tj\n? ?\n\n\u00f04:69\u00de\n\nFig. 4.27 Minimum fly-around trajectory with different aiming points\n\n126 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\nHere, Si stands for the entry corridor of target satellite i, a set of a series of initial\nfly-around peaks ~rj and initial fly-around velocities ~vk. For any spiral fly-around\npeak~vk, its fly-around period Tj must meet the following condition:\n\nTj 2 \u00bdTmin\u00f0j\u00de;Tmax\u00f0j\u00de?\n\nHere,Tmin\u00f0j\u00de stands for theminimumfly-around period of the cruising spacecraft at\n~rj; Tmax\u00f0j\u00de stands for its maximum fly-around period. xi\u00f0tj\u00de; yi\u00f0tj\u00de are the relative\npositions of the cruising spacecraft at moment tj, satisfying the relative trajectory\nconstraint. As every spiral fly-around peak has a corresponding fly-around period\ninterval, according to the short-range relative motion dynamics model, a series of\ninitial relative fly-around velocities~vk at that peak can be obtained. The entire set of\npositions and velocities [ ~rj; [ \u00f0~vk\u00de\n\n? ?\nconstitutes the entry corridor of target satellite i.\n\nBased on the current state and mission requirements, the timing and size of the\nnext control impulse needs to be calculated. The key is that the cruising spacecraft\nmust, according to its predicted state, do iterative computation in real time to see\nwhether the spiral fly-around trajectory meets the mission requirement. Its defects\nlie in the fact that a long time and a great deal of computing are needed for every\niterative computation. Therefore, its defect is that the GNC System sets high\nrequirements on the performance of the cruising spacecraft\u2019s on-board computer.\nConsidering the target group monitored by the cruising spacecraft is quite fixed,\nbased on the features of the target group, the entry corridor of the target satellite can\nbe designed in advance to reduce the real-time computing of the cruising spacecraft.\nThe design pattern of the \u201centry corridor\u201d table is shown in Table 4.3.\n\nHere, \u00f0 _xij; _yij\u00de stands for the initial velocity that the cruising spacecraft should\nhave at the spiral fly-around peak ri when the spiral fly-around period is Tj. In the\nTable, the position of the fly-around peak ri and the fly-around period Tj can be\nreasonably distributed according to actual requirements of the mission.\n\n4.5.3 Single-Pulse Control Strategy\n\nIt can be known from Eq. (4.34) that in a relative motion coordinate system, the\ndrifting ellipse parameter b of the relative motion of the cruising spacecraft can be\ndescribed as:\n\nTable 4.3 \u201cEntry corridor\u201d table\n\nT1 \u00bc Tmin T2 T3 \u2026 Tn \u00bc Tmax\nr1 \u00bc rjinqu \u00f0 _x11; _y11\u00de \u00f0 _x12; _y12\u00de \u00f0 _x13; _y13\u00de \u2026 \u00f0 _x1n; _y1n\u00de\nr2 \u00f0 _x21; _y21\u00de \u00f0 _x22; _y22\u00de \u00f0 _x23; _y23\u00de \u2026 \u00f0 _x2n; _y2n\u00de\nr3 \u00f0 _x31; _y31\u00de \u00f0 _x32; _y32\u00de \u00f0 _x33; _y33\u00de \u2026 \u00f0 _x3n; _y3n\u00de\n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026\n\nrm \u00bc rzaihe \u00f0 _xm1; _ym1\u00de \u00f0 _xm2; _ym2\u00de \u00f0 _xm3; _ym3\u00de \u00f0 _xmn; _ymn\u00de\n\n4.5 Controllable Cruising Orbit: Design 127\n\n\n\nb \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2 _y0\nn\n\n\u00fe 3x0\n? ?2\n\n\u00fe _x0\nn\n\n? ?2s\n\u00bc\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2 _y\nn\n\n\u00fe 3x\n? ?2\n\n\u00fe _x\nn\n\n? ?2s\n\u00f04:70\u00de\n\nThe drift velocity of the center of the ellipse is:\n\nV \u00bc 1:5xc0n \u00bc 6nx0 \u00fe 3 _y0 \u00bc 6nx\u00fe 3_y \u00f04:71\u00de\n\nThe distance covered by the cruising spacecraft per day is:\n\nL \u00bc 1:5xc0nT \u00bc 12px0 \u00fe 6p _y0n \u00bc 12px\u00fe 6p\n_y\nn\n\n\u00f04:72\u00de\n\nHere, \u00f0x0; y0; _x0; _y0\u00de is the initial relative motion state of the cruising spacecraft;\n\u00f0x; y; _x; _y\u00de stands for the relative motion state of the cruising spacecraft at any one\nmoment.\n\nIn a relative motion coordinate system, the control impulses, which need to be\napplied when the configuration parameters of the spiral orbit are changed according\nto the requirements of the mission, can be classified into three types: along-track\ndirection Dvx, radial direction Dvy, and normal direction Dvz. When the impulses are\napplied in different directions, their effect also varies remarkably. For the design of\na spiral controllable cruising orbit, due to the decoupling of the control in the\nnormal direction and the control in the target satellite plane, the relative motion\ncontrol in the normal direction of the target orbit can be designed separately.\n\n(1) Impulse control in the along-track direction\n\nIf the velocity increment in the along-track direction is used to change the spiral\ncruising orbit, for a near-circular target orbit, we differentiate b and the following\ncan be obtained:\n\nDb \u00bc D\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2_y\nn\n\n\u00fe 3x\n? ?2\n\n\u00fe _x\nn\n\n? ?2s\n\u00bc 2\n\nnb\n2_y\nn\n\n\u00fe 3x\n? ?\n\nD _y \u00f04:73\u00de\n\nWhen we substitute the expression of the solution of x and _y into Eq.

At the highest point and the\nlowest point of the spiral cruising orbit in the radial direction, applying radial\nimpulse does not change the semi-minor axis of the spiral cruising orbit b.\n\n(4) Radial impulse control does not change the radial initial relative position of the\nspiral cruising orbit center xc.\n\nIn summary, for the impulse control method of the configuration parameter of a\ndrifting ellipse, the following control strategies can be adopted:\n\n\u2022 When the semi-minor axis of the drifting ellipse is to be adjusted, radial or\nalong-tack control is needed, and the along-track control has better effect;\n\n\u2022 When the drift velocity of the drifting ellipse center is to be adjusted, along-track\nimpulse control is needed;\n\n\u2022 When the radial migration of the drifting ellipse center is to be adjusted,\nalong-tack impulse control is needed;\n\n\u2022 When the along-track migration of the of the drifting ellipse center is to be\nadjusted, radial impulse control is needed.\n\nWe can take adjusting the orbit parameters of a spiral cruising orbit by using\nradial control as an example. We select three target satellites (as Fig. 4.29 shows),\nand the target set is 0; 1:4e\u00fe 003; 2:3e\u00fe 003 kmf g. If a natural spiral method is\napplied, the fly-around observation of target spacecraft 1 and target spacecraft 3 can\nbe achieved, without conducting the fly-around of target spacecraft 2. If the\nfly-around trajectory of target spacecraft 2 is to be formed, relative orbit control\nneeds to be conducted before the fly-around.\n\n4.5 Controllable Cruising Orbit: Design 131\n\n\n\nIf we do not change the basic configuration parameters such as the cruising\nradius of the cruising orbit, target 2 can also be included in the center of the\nfly-around area of the cruising orbit via changing the along-track initial relative\nposition of the center of the spiral cruising orbit, as Fig. 4.30 shows.\n\nTrajectory 1 is a natural spiral drift configuration without control, while tra-\njectory 2 is a spiral drift configuration with control.\n\nAccording to the general principle of orbit control, applying impulse control at\nthe intersection of two trajectories can achieve the switch of trajectories. Therefore,\napplying impulse control at intersection 332:2;?189:1\u00f0 \u00de can achieve control switch\nfrom trajectory 1 to trajectory 2; then applying impulse control at intersection\n189:3;?189:3\u00f0 \u00de can achieve control switch from trajectory 2 back to trajectory 1.\nThe velocity increment required for the control is 2.8 m/s, with the two controls\nhaving opposite directions. After applying the above controls, the trajectory of the\nspiral cruising orbit eventually obtained is shown in Fig. 4.31.\n\nFig. 4.30 Transfer control point from trajectory 2 to trajectory 1\n\nFig. 4.29 Natural spiral fly-around trajectory of target spacecraft 1 and 3\n\n132 4 Theory and Design Method of Spiral Cruising Orbit\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Fast Cruising Control Strategy\n\nWhen the natural drifting spiral trajectory method is applied to conduct fly-around\nobservation, relative motion control is easily achieved and the control quantity\nrequired, i.e., the fuel consumed, is less; but the moment to apply control quantity\nmust be stipulated, and the time of the transition process of the control is long.

Spacecraft operating in spiral\ncruising orbit are low in energy consumption (less energy consumed in control) but\nhigh in cost-effectiveness (with a single spacecraft being able to achieve the\ndetection of multiple spacecraft in the target orbit). It can carry out\nmulti-perspective (larger than 180\u00b0, able to reach 360\u00b0), short-range and\nhigh-precision detection and is of great application value in the realm of space\ntarget surveillance.\n\nIn this chapter, starting from different application goals, the design method of\nthree kinds of spiral cruising orbits (traversal orbit, round-trip orbit and controllable\norbit) are introduced; and detailed control methods are provided. Finally, combined\nwith typical cases, the feasibility and practicability of the design and control\nmethods of the spiral cruising orbit are analyzed by simulation.\n\n4.6 Summary 137\n\n\n\nChapter 5\nTheory and Design Method\nof Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit Based\non Traversing Points\n\nThis chapter will propose a new concept\u2014traversing point\u2014to deal with the orbital\nrendezvous of a servicing spacecraft and multiple target spacecraft. Based on the\nnew concept, it will provide the orbit rendezvous methods for coplanar multi-target\nspacecraft and non-coplanar multi-target spacecraft. The focus will be on the latter.\nThis method, with the introduction of the concept \u201ctraversing point\u201d, turns the\norbital rendezvous of non-coplanar multi-target spacecraft into the coplanar\nmulti-point orbital rendezvous. Therefore, it will provide a possibility for the fast\nand energy-efficient orbit rendezvous of one servicing spacecraft and multiple target\nspacecraft in different orbits.\n\n5.1 Multi-Target Orbital Rendezvous:\nProblem Description\n\nAs a kind of orbit maneuver, an orbital rendezvous refers to the course in which a\ntracking spacecraft conducts rendezvous with a target spacecraft at a certain time\nand place in space. Generally, orbit control is needed in an orbital rendezvous.\nThus, the degree of complexity in orbital control and its demand for energy and\ntime should be considered in order to achieve the orbit rendezvous. As we know,\namong a variety of ways for orbit maneuver, changing the orbit plane requires huge\nfuel consumption from the spacecraft and its control process is quite complex. So a\ncoplanar orbit plane is usually adopted as a way to achieve an orbit rendezvous. In\nother words, if the tracking spacecraft and the target spacecraft are in the same orbit\nplane, then the orbit rendezvous could be achieved simply by a coplanar orbital\nmaneuver of the tracking spacecraft.\n\nWith increasing types of space mission, the demand for the capability of an\norbital rendezvous is also growing. Because spacecraft manufacturing, launching\nand operating management are costly, to save cost and improve efficiency, we need\n\n\u00a9 National Defense Industry Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017\nY. Zhang et al., Theory and Design Methods of Special Space Orbits,\nDOI 10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6_5\n\n139\n\n\n\na servicing spacecraft capable of on-orbit serving as many target spacecraft as\npossible. In other words, a \u201cone-to-many\u201d on-orbit service mode should be adopted.\nAccording to statistics, the number of operational on-orbit spacecraft reached 1084\nas of September 1, 2013. They are distributed in multiple orbit planes (Fig. 5.1). If\nthose abandoned on-orbit satellites were also included, then the number of orbit\nplanes could be even bigger. When the traditional method of coplanar orbital\nrendezvous is adopted, even if a servicing spacecraft is able to serve multiple target\nspacecraft in its own orbit plane, it is still necessary to launch numerous servicing\nspacecraft into different orbit planes. This is apparently costly. Therefore, to better\nmeet the \u201cone-to-many\u201d on-orbit service requirements and improve its efficiency,\nhow to achieve the orbital rendezvous of multi-target spacecraft, especially those\nnon-coplanar ones, has become an important and urgent issue.\n\nIn this chapter, the problems in multi-target orbital rendezvous in space will be\ndivided into two parts: the orbital rendezvous of coplanar multi-target spacecraft\nand the orbital rendezvous of non-coplanar multi-target spacecraft. On the one\nhand, orbital rendezvous of coplanar multi-target spacecraft refers to the orbital\nrendezvous of a servicing spacecraft and multiple target spacecraft in one orbit\nplane, covering problems in the orbit design and orbit control of the rendezvous\norbit. On the other hand, orbital rendezvous of non-coplanar multi-target spacecraft\nrefers to the orbit design and orbit control of the rendezvous orbit when a servicing\nspacecraft separately conducts rendezvous with multiple target spacecraft in other\norbit planes through orbit maneuver.\n\nGenerally, orbit design includes the design of a parking orbit and the rendezvous\norbit of the servicing spacecraft. Orbit control contains two parts: the first is the\norbit control of the servicing spacecraft from the parking orbit to the rendezvous\norbit; and the second is the orbit control between the rendezvous orbits of the\nservicing spacecraft and each of the target spacecraft. It is obvious that, to make the\n\u201cone-to-many\u201d on-orbit rendezvous mode feasible, the operation procedures of the\norbit control should be simplified and the energy consumed in the orbit maneuver\nshould be reduced as much as possible.\n\nGenerally speaking, the spacecraft\u2019s operation orbit can be described by six orbit\nelements \u00f0a; e; i;X;x; s\u00de or geocentric coordinates \u00f0x; y; z\u00de. If we assume that the\n\nFig. 5.1 Distribution map of\non-orbit spacecraft orbit\ninclinations\n\n140 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\norbit elements of the servicing spacecraft are \u00f0aS; eS; iS;XS;xS; sS\u00de, then its orbital\nrendezvous positions with n target spacecraft can be written as:\n\nP1 : \u00f0t1; x1; y1; z1\u00de\nP2 : \u00f0t2; x2; y2; z2\u00de\n\n..\n\n.\n\nPn : \u00f0tn; xn; yn; zn\u00de\n\nHere, Pi\u00f0i \u00bc 1; 2; ? ? ? ; n\u00de represents the time and positions of orbital rendezvous\nbetween the servicing spacecraft and n target spacecraft. Apparently, these n posi-\ntions with time attributes are supposed to be in the servicing spacecraft\u2019s orbit.\nFigure 5.2 shows what it will be like when n \u00bc 3.\n\nIn Fig. 5.2, the rendezvous orbit conducts rendezvous with three target orbits at\npoints A, B and C, respectively. As we know, two random points in space can be\nconnected by an infinite number of orbits. But when there are three or more points,\nthe orbit which connects them all may not exist unless orbital maneuvers are\nconducted. Therefore, in orbital design, it is highly unlikely for a rendezvous orbit\nwhich can conduct rendezvous with more than three target orbits simultaneously to\nexist. In that case, orbit control is needed.\n\nFor most rendezvous missions in space, a zero distance between the servicing\nspacecraft and the target spacecraft is not required. It means that we only need to\nsend the servicing spacecraft to the vicinity of the target spacecraft (within a relative\ndistance from several dozens to hundreds of kilometers). Hence, the multi-target\norbital rendezvous method studied in this chapter is not only for multi-target ren-\ndezvous missions, but also for multi-target orbit interception missions.\n\nFig. 5.2 Schematic figure of orbital rendezvous of servicing spacecraft and target spacecraft\n\n5.1 Multi-Target Orbital Rendezvous: Problem Description 141\n\n\n\n5.2 Traversing Point: Concept and Determination Method\n\n5.2.1 Traversing Point: Concept\n\nTo reduce the complexity and the cost of orbit control in orbital rendezvous,\ncoplanar orbital maneuver, apparently, becomes a relatively ideal option. However,\nif the target spacecraft are in different orbit planes, it is obviously impossible for the\nservicing spacecraft to be coplanar with each target simultaneously. Actually, for an\norbital rendezvous to occur, the servicing spacecraft is not required to conduct\nrendezvous with the target spacecraft\u2019s entire orbit, but only with the target\nspacecraft\u2019s orbit at a certain point. That is, all we need is to make the rendezvous\npoint coplanar with the operational trajectory of the servicing spacecraft.\n\nAccording to Kepler\u2019s First Law, the orbit of every spacecraft rotating around the\nEarth is in the plane passing through the Earth-center. So it is certain that any two\nspacecraft\u2019s orbit planes will intersect. Therefore, if the plane of the parking orbit of\nthe servicing spacecraft is taken as the reference plane, it will intersect all the target\norbit planes and the intersection points in the reference plane will be on their inter-\nsection lines. It is obvious that the intersection line passes through the Earth-center\nand the intersection points are on both sides of the Earth-center, as Fig. 5.3 shows.\n\nFigure 5.3 shows the intersection of two orbit planes. The target spacecraft\npasses through the plane of the parking orbit of the servicing spacecraft (i.e., the\nreference plane) and there are two intersection points on the intersection line of the\ntwo planes. We call the intersection points \u201ctraversing points\u201d.\n\nHere, the one located in the northern hemisphere of the geocentric celestial sphere\nis called the north traversing point, and the other in the southern hemisphere\u2014the\nsouth traversing point. The phase difference of the two traversing points is 180\u00b0.\n\nFig. 5.3 Conceptual figure of traversing points\n\n142 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nClearly, in the orbit plane of the servicing spacecraft, two traversing points will\nbe formed by any target spacecraft that is not coplanar with the servicing spacecraft.\nAnd the target spacecraft will continuously pass through the orbit plane of the\nservicing spacecraft at the two traversing points.\n\nThat is, a large number of traversing points are scattered in the orbit plane of the\nservicing spacecraft. These points are both in the orbit of the target spacecraft and in\nthe orbit plane of the servicing spacecraft. If these traversing points are set as the\nrendezvous points of the target spacecraft and the servicing spacecraft, then the\nservicing spacecraft can achieve orbital rendezvous with the target spacecraft by\nconducting in-plane orbital maneuvers without having to change its orbit plane.\n\nThe method of conducting orbital rendezvous of the servicing spacecraft and\nseveral target spacecraft at traversing points is what we propose in this chapter\u2014the\nnon-coplanar multi-target orbital rendezvous method based on traversing points.\n\nUsing this method, a non-coplanar orbital rendezvous can be turned into a\ncoplanar one. For more than one target spacecraft, this method can also be applied\nand completely meets the demands of the \u201cone-to-many\u201d orbital rendezvous mode.\n\nIn reality, the coplanar rendezvous points can also be taken as the traversing\npoints, as is shown in Fig. 5.4.\n\nIn Fig. 5.4, A, B, C, D, E and F are the rendezvous points of the rendezvous\norbit with target orbits 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These points can be taken as the\ntraversing points formed by the target spacecraft when it traverses the servicing\nspacecraft orbit. Clearly, in a coplanar orbital rendezvous, it is the orbit of the\nservicing spacecraft that the target spacecraft traverses and the traversing points are\nin the orbit of the servicing spacecraft. However, in a non-coplanar orbital ren-\ndezvous, it is the orbit plane of the servicing spacecraft that the target spacecraft\npasses through and the traversing points are in the orbit plane of the servicing\nspacecraft. So the traversing points in a coplanar orbital rendezvous can serve as a\n\nFig. 5.4 Traversing points in\ncoplanar multi-target orbital\nrendezvous\n\n5.2 Traversing Point: Concept and Determination Method 143\n\n\n\nparticular case of the traversing points in a non-coplanar orbital rendezvous. Taking\nthis into consideration, we will focus on the non-coplanar multi-target orbital\nrendezvous method in this chapter.\n\n5.2.2 Traversing Point: Determination Method\n\nIn general, the operation orbit of a spacecraft can be described by six orbit elements\n\u00f0a; e; i;X;x; s\u00de. Here, we can use two orbit elements i;X to solely determine the\norbit plane in which the spacecraft operates.\n\nAccording to the definition of the traversing point, there will be two traversing\npoints formed by the orbit of each spacecraft in an appointed orbit plane. It means\nthat we need to first determine the plane through which the spacecraft will pass.\n\nWe assume that the orbit plane of the servicing spacecraft, denoted by orbit\nelements \u00f0is;Xs\u00de, is the rendezvous orbit plane. And we also suppose that a target\nspacecraft passes through the plane and its orbit elements are \u00f0at; et; it;Xt;xt; st\u00de as\nFig. 5.5 shows.\n\nIn Fig. 5.5, A and A0 are the two rendezvous points of the target spacecraft\u2019s\norbit and the rendezvous plane, namely, the north traversing point and the south\ntraversing point; point B is the ascending node of the orbit of the target satellite;\npoint C is the ascending node in the rendezvous orbit plane. The coordinates of the\ntraversing point in the rendezvous orbit plane can be denoted as \u00f0t; r;/\u00de. Here, t is\nthe time when the target spacecraft passes through the plane; r is the geocentric\ndistance of the traversing point; / is the argument of the ascending node of the\ntraversing point in the rendezvous orbit plane.\n\nFig. 5.5 Spatial geometric relationship diagram of traversing points in non-coplanar orbit\nrendezvous\n\n144 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nThus, the coordinates of north traversing point A are tN ; rN ;/N\u00f0 \u00de. Here, tN is the\ntime when the target spacecraft passes through north traversing point A; rN \u00bc OeA\nis the geocentric distance of north traversing point A; /N \u00bc \\AOeC is the argument\nof the ascending node of traversing point A in the rendezvous plane.

They only differ in the distance rN ; rS,\nwhich are related to the size, shape and perigee direction of the target spacecraft.\n\nOn the other hand, for traversing moment tN or tS, they are not the only moments\nbecause the target spacecraft passes through the north traversing point and the south\ntraversing point respectively in every orbit period.

In this way, the energy consumption in the non-coplanar orbital\nrendezvous can be reduced. On the other hand, in a multi-target orbit rendezvous\nbased on traversing point, the servicing spacecraft achieves orbital rendezvous with\nmultiple target spacecraft at the traversing points by multiple maneuverings in its\norbit plane. Through sound orbit design and the control of the orbit rendezvous, the\nservicing spacecraft can even achieve orbital rendezvous with multiple target\nspacecraft in a single orbit period. Thus, rendezvous time and energy consumption\nin the process can be greatly reduced.\n\nFor the lattermethodabove, the servicing spacecraft and the target spacecraft arenot\nrequired to be in the same orbit plane, andmultiple target spacecraft are not required to\nbe coplanar, either. The main constraining factors are the number of the target space-\ncraft, the positions of traversing points, the orbital rendezvous time with the target\nspacecraft and the energy constraint of orbital maneuver of the servicing spacecraft.\n\nAt present, on-orbit spacecraft are mainly located in three orbit regions\u2014low\nearth orbit (LEO; orbit altitude: 200\u20131500 km), medium earth orbit (MEO; orbit\naltitude: 19,000\u201323,000 km) and high orbit (GEO; orbit altitude: 36,000 km).\nAccording to the American UCS database,1 as of May 31, 2013, the number of\n\n1Union of Concerned Scientists. UCS Satellite Database [EB/OL]. http://www.ucsusa.Org/nuclear-\nweap-ons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html.\n\n5.2 Traversing Point: Concept and Determination Method 147\n\nhttp://www.ucsusa.Org/nuclear-weap-ons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html\nhttp://www.ucsusa.Org/nuclear-weap-ons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html\n\n\non-orbit spacecraft was 1071, consisting of 523 LEO satellites, 75 MEO satellites,\n435 GEO satellites, and 38 highly elliptical Earth orbit (HEO) satellites. Figure 5.7\nshows the distribution of on-orbit spacecraft in different orbits.\n\nTherefore, aiming at the target spacecraft in three different orbit regions (LEO,\nMEO and GEO), we need to design the orbit of the servicing spacecraft separately.\nFor the multi-target orbit rendezvous method based on traversing point, the ser-\nvicing spacecraft and the target spacecraft are not required to be coplanar. However,\nif the servicing spacecraft is coplanar with the most important target spacecraft in\nthe target spacecraft group, the chances of the orbital rendezvous between the\nservicing spacecraft and this target spacecraft will be increased.\n\n5.3.2 Rendezvous Orbit: Design Method\n\nThough the target spacecraft in different orbit regions are not coplanar with the orbit\nplane of the servicing spacecraft deployed in the regions, according to the concept\nof traversing point, it is certain that all the target spacecraft in this region will form\nseveral pairs of traversing points in the orbit plane of the servicing spacecraft. To\nachieve the orbital rendezvous of the servicing spacecraft and multiple target\nspacecraft more effectively, the design of the rendezvous orbit of the servicing\nspacecraft in this orbit plane should be optimized.\n\nTraversing points are spatial points with time stamps. Therefore, besides passing\nthrough these traversing points, the rendezvous orbit of the servicing spacecraft\nshould also pass through them at their marked time. If there are only two traversing\npoints to pass through, according to the Lambert Time Theorem, we can design a\nrendezvous orbit that passes through them both and the time of passing will also\nmeet the requirement of the marked time. However, if the servicing spacecraft are\nrequired to pass through three or more traversing points, then it would be difficult to\ndesign a rendezvous orbit. In such a case, an orbit maneuver is needed for the\nservicing spacecraft.\n\nWe assume that there are four target spacecraft, and they will form eight\ntraversing points in the orbit plane of the servicing spacecraft, as is shown in\nFig. 5.8.\n\nTo make the servicing spacecraft approach these traversing points as close as\npossible, we first need to conduct orbit fitting for these traversing points. According\n\nFig. 5.7 Distribution of\non-orbit spacecraft in different\norbits\n\n148 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nto orbit dynamics, the fitting obit should be an elliptic cone curve and the\nEarth-center should be on a focal point on the fitting curve, as is shown in Fig. 5.9.\n\nAfter that, we calculate the time when the servicing spacecraft passes through\neach traversing point respectively according to the fitting orbit. Then we compare\nthe time with the marked time when the target spacecraft pass through these\ntraversing points. By adjusting the initial phase of the servicing spacecraft or the\ntime when the servicing spacecraft passes through the perigee, we can ensure that\nthe servicing spacecraft passes through the traversing points at their marked time as\n\nFig. 5.8 Schematic figure of\nfour target spacecraft and\neight traversing points\n\nFig. 5.9 Rendezvous orbit\nbased on traversing point\nfitting\n\n5.3 Orbital Rendezvous: Strategies Based on Traversing Point 149\n\n\n\npunctually as possible. If the servicing spacecraft cannot pass through some\ntraversing points at their marked time, or if it cannot pass through the traversing\npoints with one rendezvous orbit, then the orbital rendezvous at the traversing\npoints can only be achieved by orbit control in the orbit plane.\n\n5.3.3 Orbital Rendezvous: Control Method\n\nBased on a traversing point set, we can design an optimized rendezvous orbit by\ncurve fitting. However, as traversing points are special positions marked by time\nstamps, and the optimized rendezvous orbit is designed to have the minimum sum\nof total distances, we can only ensure that the rendezvous orbit is as close as\npossible to the traversing point set. However, when the servicing spacecraft in the\nrendezvous orbit passes through or nears a traversing point, we cannot ensure that\nthe target spacecraft can pass through the traversing point there on time. In general,\nthe target spacecraft is not controllable or even non-cooperative. Therefore, orbit\ncontrol of the servicing spacecraft is needed to ensure that it reaches the vicinity of\na traversing point on time when a target spacecraft passes through it.\n\nIn this section, according to the relative position difference of a traversing point\nand a rendezvous orbit, we will propose three control methods for orbital ren-\ndezvous\u2014phase adjustment, time-fixed orbital maneuvering and separate ren-\ndezvous trajectory.\n\n(1) Method 1: Phase adjustment\n\nThis method is mainly used in multi-target orbital rendezvous missions in which\nthe rendezvous orbit passes through traversing points correctly and the rendezvous\ntime is not strictly required. It is shown in Fig. 5.10.\n\nFig. 5.10 Time and position\nrelationship among traversing\npoints and rendezvous orbit\n\n150 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nIn Fig. 5.10, traversing points A and B are both in the rendezvous orbit. By\ndesigning the time when the rendezvous orbit passes through the perigee, time t1\nwhen the servicing spacecraft in the rendezvous orbit reaches point A can be made\nequal to time tA when target spacecraft 1 passes through traversing point A. That is,\nthe orbital rendezvous of the servicing spacecraft and the target spacecraft 1 at\ntraversing point A can be achieved without an orbit control. However, time t2 when\nthe servicing spacecraft reaches traversing point B is different from time tB when\ntarget spacecraft 2 passes through traversing point B. And there is a time difference\nbetween them Dt \u00bc t2 ? tB\u00f0 \u00de. After t1, the servicing spacecraft moves along the\nrendezvous orbit and reaches point B. If it still cannot conduct rendezvous with\ntarget spacecraft 2, then orbit control of the servicing spacecraft is required.\n\nBy phase adjustment, the time when the servicing spacecraft passes through\ntraversing point B again can be adjusted to t02 \u00bc t2 ? Dt, as is shown in Fig. 5.11.\n\nThe method of phase adjustment shown above is to conduct orbit maneuver at\nthe apogee of the rendezvous orbit in order to make the servicing spacecraft go into\na phasing orbit with the same apogee. As the dotted line shows in Fig. 5.11, ta is the\ntime when the servicing spacecraft reaches the apogee before phasing, and t0a is the\ntime when the servicing spacecraft reaches the apogee after phasing. By means of\nphasing, after completing a period in the phasing orbit, the servicing spacecraft\nreturns to the apogee and then goes back into the original rendezvous orbit through\nmaneuvering. The time when it returns to the apogee ensures that it will conduct\nrendezvous with the target spacecraft when it moves along the rendezvous orbit and\nreaches point B. In other words, the relation between time t02 when the servicing\nspacecraft reaches point B and time tB when the target spacecraft reaches point B is:\n\nt02 \u00bc tB \u00fe nT2 \u00f05:10\u00de\n\nHere, T2 is the orbit period of target spacecraft 2 and n is an integer that is equal\nto or greater than 0.\n\nAccording to the method above, the servicing spacecraft will need many times of\nphase adjustment as the number of target spacecraft increases. In the most extreme\ncase, for N target spacecraft, the servicing spacecraft will need to conduct N?1\n\n(a) 0t? > (b) 0<? t\n\nFig. 5.11 Schematic figure of phase adjustment. a Dt[ 0 b Dt\\0\n\n5.3 Orbital Rendezvous: Strategies Based on Traversing Point 151\n\n\n\ntimes of phase adjustment. Apparently, it means more rendezvous time and multiple\ntimes of control. As a result, a fast multi-target spacecraft orbital rendezvous is not\npossible.\n\n(2) Method 2: Time-fixed orbital maneuvering\n\nThis method is mainly applied in multi-target orbital rendezvous missions in\nwhich the rendezvous orbit can pass through the traversing points correctly and\nthere are strict requirements for rendezvous time.\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 5.6, the rendezvous orbit passes through traversing points\nA and B, and the servicing spacecraft conducts a rendezvous with target spacecraft 1\nat t1 and at traversing point A. However, time t2 when the servicing spacecraft\nreaches traversing point B is different from time tB when target spacecraft 2 passes\nthrough traversing point B, meaning there is a time difference. If it is required by the\nmission that the servicing spacecraft should conduct rendezvous with target\nspacecraft 2 at t2, with Dt \u00bc t2 ? t1 not long enough for a phase adjustment, the\nservicing spacecraft can only travel from traversing point A to traversing point\nB along a time-fixed rendezvous orbit, as is shown in Fig. 5.12.\n\nIn Fig. 5.12, the dotted line is the trajectory of time-fixed orbital maneuvering.\nAccording to this method, the servicing spacecraft will need multiple times of orbit\nmaneuver as the number of target spacecraft increases. In the most extreme case, for\nN target spacecraft, the servicing spacecraft will need to conduct N?1 times of orbit\nmaneuver. Clearly, even though it is conducted in the orbit plane, the maneuver still\nconsumes more energy and needs more orbit control, thus inevitably increasing the\ncomplexity of the orbit control.\n\n(3) Method 3: Separate rendezvous trajectory\n\nThis method is mainly used in the multi-target orbital rendezvous missions when\nthe traversing points are not in the rendezvous orbit. In this method, it is necessary\nto separate a rendezvous trajectory from the rendezvous orbit and make it connected\n\nFig. 5.12 Schematic figure\nof time-fixed orbital\nmaneuvering\n\n152 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nto the traversing points which are far away from the rendezvous orbit, as is shown\nin Fig. 5.13.\n\nIn Fig. 5.13, the separation points are in the rendezvous orbit and the trajectories\nconnecting the separation points with the traversing points are called rendezvous\ntrajectories. Here, the term \u201ctrajectory\u201d means that it is not a closed curve but a part\nof a conical curve separated from the rendezvous orbit.\n\nEvery traversing point has its time constraint. When separation points are\ndetermined, a rendezvous trajectory can be solely determined by the Lambert Time\nTheorem. Obviously, for a certain traversing point, different separation points will\nhave different rendezvous trajectories.\n\nThis method differs from the time-fixed orbital maneuvering method in the fact\nthat it aims at achieving the orbital rendezvous with traversing points that are not in\nthe rendezvous orbit.\n\n5.4 Non-Coplanar Homogeneous Multi-Target\nRendezvous Orbit: Design Method\n\nA non-coplanar homogeneous multi-target orbital rendezvous refers to the orbital\nrendezvous of a servicing spacecraft and multiple target spacecraft that are with the\nsame orbit type and altitude and are evenly distributed in space. An example is the\ncase when the target spacecraft are the satellites in a certain Walker Constellation. It\nis shown in Fig. 5.14.\n\nIn Fig. 5.14, target orbits 1 and 2 are orbits in the first and the second orbit\nplanes of a Walker Constellation N/P/F respectively. Point B is the ascending node\nof target satellite 1 while point C is the ascending node of target satellite 2. When\n\nFig. 5.13 Schematic figure of rendezvous trajectory\n\n5.3 Orbital Rendezvous: Strategies Based on Traversing Point 153\n\n\n\nthe first satellite in the first orbit plane is at point B, the last satellite in the second\norbit plane is at point A. When travelling along a rendezvous orbit from point B to\npoint D, a servicing spacecraft conducts a rendezvous with target satellite 1 at point\nB, and with target satellite 2 at point D. Then a spherical triangle is formed by\npoints A, B and C.\n\nWe assume that A;B;C and a; b; c are the three angles and three sides of the\nspherical triangle respectively, then:\n\nC \u00bc i\nb \u00bc 2pS ? 2pN ? F\na \u00bc 2pP\n\n8<\n: \u00f05:11\u00de\n\nIn Eq. (5.11), i is the orbit inclination of the target orbit; N is the total number of\nsatellites in the Walker Constellation; P is the number of orbit planes in the Walker\nConstellation; S is the number of satellites in each orbit plane in the Walker\nConstellation; F is the phase factor.\n\nUsing the cotangent four-part formula, we obtain:\n\ntgA \u00bc sinCctga? sin b?cos b? cosC\ntgB \u00bc sinCctgb? sin a?cos a? cosC\n\n(\n\u00f05:12\u00de\n\nAccording to the properties of the Walker Constellation, the two target satellites\nare both in circular orbits and they are at the same velocity and the following can be\nobtained:\n\n_\nBD \u00bc _CD\n\nFig. 5.14 Spatial geometric\nrelationship among\nrendezvous orbit and satellite\norbits in Walker Constellation\n\n154 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nIn spherical triangle ABD:\n\n]DBA \u00bc ]DAB \u00bc ]A\n\nThen the orbit inclination of the rendezvous orbit is:\n\ni1 \u00bc ]DBC \u00bc ]A? ]B\n\nIf we adjust the phase of the servicing spacecraft, the following can be obtained:\n\nDf \u00bc 2p\nS\n\nThen it can conduct rendezvous with adjacent target satellites which are coplanar\nwith the target satellites in the Walker Constellation.\n\nSimilarly, for a servicing spacecraft, with each phase adjustment of\nmDf \u00f01?m? S? 1\u00de, it will be able to conduct rendezvous with other target\nsatellites in the Walker Constellation. Therefore, when the servicing spacecraft\nadjusts its phase for S? 1 times in the rendezvous orbit plane, it will conduct\nrendezvous with 3 ? S target satellites in three adjacent orbit planes in the Walker\nConstellation. If each phase adjustment can be completed in one orbit period, then\nthe total time needed to achieve an orbital rendezvous will be:\n\nT \u00bc \u00f0S? 1\u00de ? Tm \u00fe S? Tm \u00bc \u00f02? S? 1\u00deTm \u00f05:13\u00de\n\nIn Eq. (5.13), Tm is the orbit period of the target satellite. Here, we will take a\nWalker Constellation as an example. Its constellation configuration is 24/4/1, with\nan orbit inclination of 55\u00b0 and an orbit altitude of 20,200 km. We will design a\nrendezvous orbit which can conduct rendezvous with three target satellites\u2014Sat 11,\nSat 26 and Sat 41\u2014in the Constellation.\n\nFrom Eq. (5.11), we know:\n\nC \u00bc 55?; a \u00bc 90?; b \u00bc 45?\n\nWhen it is substituted into Eq. (5.12), the following can be obtained:\n\nA \u00bc 116:341?; B \u00bc 39:3227?\n\nSo the inclination of the rendezvous orbit is:\n\ni1 \u00bc 77:01?\n\nIn sum, the orbit parameters of the servicing spacecraft are shown in Table 5.1.\nThe satellites in the Walker Constellation pass through the rendezvous orbit\n\nplane and form six traversing points A, B, C, D, E and F. These traversing points\n\n5.4 Non-Coplanar Homogeneous Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026 155\n\n\n\nare evenly distributed at 60\u00b0 intervals in the rendezvous orbit of the servicing\nspacecraft, as is shown in Fig. 5.15.\n\nWith software STK, we can simulate the design result of the rendezvous orbit.\nThe simulation period is 24 h. Figure 5.16 shows the variation in relative distance\nbetween the servicing spacecraft and three target satellites in three adjacent orbit\nplanes in the Walker Constellation.\n\nIt is clear that, in one orbit period, there are two chances for the rendezvous\nbetween the servicing spacecraft and three target satellites.\n\nWith a phase adjustment of 60\u00b0 of the servicing spacecraft, an accurate ren-\ndezvous with Sat 12, Sat 21, and Sat 42 can be achieved. Similarly, for each phase\nadjustment of 60\u00b0 of the servicing spacecraft, the orbital rendezvous of the servicing\nspacecraft and three target satellites in three adjacent orbit planes can be achieved\nrespectively. Hence, by five phase adjustments, the servicing spacecraft can achieve\nrendezvous in its rendezvous orbit plane with 18 target satellites in three orbit\nplanes in the Walker Constellation. If every phase adjustment can be conducted\nwithin an orbit period, the total time needed for the orbital rendezvous is:\n\nT \u00bc 5? Tm \u00fe 6? Tm \u00bc 11Tm\n\nTable 5.1 Design results of rendezvous orbit\n\nSemi-major\naxis (km)\n\nEccentricity Orbit\ninclination (deg)\n\nRight ascension of\nascending\nnode (deg)\n\nArgument of\nperigee (deg)\n\nInitial\nphase (deg)\n\nRe+20,200 0 77.01 Same with sat 11 Same with\nsat 11\n\nSame with\nsat 11\n\nFig. 5.15 Schematic figure\nof distribution of traversing\npoints\n\n156 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nHere, Tm is the orbit period of the target satellite, namely, 12 h. That is to say,\nthe servicing spacecraft can achieve its orbital rendezvous with 18 satellites in the\nWalker Constellation within 132 h.\n\n5.5 Non-Coplanar Heterogeneous Multi-Target\nRendezvous Orbit: Design Method\n\nA non-coplanar heterogeneous multi-target orbital rendezvous refers to the orbital\nrendezvous of a servicing spacecraft and multiple target spacecraft which differ in\norbit parameters such as orbit plane, orbit type, and orbit altitude. An example is\nwhen the target spacecraft are operating respectively in circular orbits and elliptical\norbits that are non-coplanar.\n\nFig. 5.16 Relative distance between servicing spacecraft and three target satellites\n\n5.4 Non-Coplanar Homogeneous Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026 157\n\n\n\n5.5.1 Design Procedures\n\nThe design procedures of a non-coplanar multi-target rendezvous orbit are as\nfollows:\n\n(1) Determine the rendezvous orbit plane and traversing points\n\nAs we know, an orbit plane is determined by its orbit inclination and the right\nascension of the ascending node. So, if the rendezvous orbit plane is previously\ndetermined, we can use the target spacecraft\u2019s orbits to directly determine the\ntraversing points of the target spacecraft in the rendezvous orbit plane. If the\nrendezvous orbit is not previously determined, we then need to optimize the design\nof the orbit inclination and the right ascension of the ascending node of the ren-\ndezvous orbit.\n\n(2) Determine the traversing point set\n\nIf no key target is specified particularly, for m target orbits, there will be 2 m\ntraversing points. Then the traversing point set can have 3m possibilities. For each\npossibility, there are three likelihoods\u2014the rendezvous orbit passes through both of\nthe two traversing points or either one of the traversing points, so we need to\nexplore every likelihood through a search method.\n\n(3) Optimize the design of a rendezvous orbit\n\nAfter we have the traversing point set ready and know the orbit is elliptical, we\ncan determine the shape of the rendezvous orbit by maximum likelihood estimation.\nThe fitting results are semi-major axis, eccentricity and perigee argument.\n\n(4) Optimize the design of a rendezvous trajectory\n\nFor the traversing time of each traversing point, in designing the time of perigee\npassage of a rendezvous orbit, it is necessary that the servicing spacecraft and the\ntarget spacecraft reach a traversing point simultaneously. If the fitting rendezvous\norbit is quite far away from a certain traversing point, we then need to separate from\nthe rendezvous orbit a rendezvous trajectory which passes through the traversing\npoint. The design of this rendezvous trajectory should be based on the maneuvering\ncapability of the servicing spacecraft and the specific goals of an optimized design.\nA general design goal could be time optimization or correction speed optimization,\nor a weighted comprehensive combination of both.\n\n5.5.2 Rendezvous Orbit: Design Method\n\nIn essence, rendezvous orbit design is to fit an elliptical orbit that satisfies Kepler\u2019s\nLaws based on traversing points formed by the target spacecraft in the rendezvous\norbit plane in order to make the sum of total distances from each traversing point to\n\n158 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nthe elliptical orbit relatively small. This will ensure the servicing spacecraft\u2019s\nmaximum approximation to the target spacecraft in space.

That is, for m target orbits, there should be 2m traversing\npoints. The number of traversing points, n, available for use in the design of a\nrendezvous orbit satisfies m? n? 2m. Apparently, when the number of traversing\npoint sets, n, is different, the rendezvous orbit designed on the basis of this number\nis very likely to be different.\n\nFor example, three target orbits will form six traversing points in a rendezvous\norbit plane, as is shown in Table 5.2.\n\nFor a rendezvous orbit, we assume that its iteration precision of the semi-major\naxis, the eccentricity and the perigee argument are 500 m, 1e?8 and 0:01?,\nrespectively. The optimized design result is:\n\nn \u00bc 7:72545e + 006 m; 0:00378887; 0:109803?\u00f0 \u00deT\n\nWhen the first five traversing points are selected, the optimized design result is:\n\nn \u00bc 7:6466e\u00fe 006 m; 0:0191879; 0:711686?\u00f0 \u00deT\n\nApparently, the rendezvous orbits designed on the basis of the two traversing\npoint sets above are different, as is shown in Fig. 5.18.\n\nFor one target orbit, there are two traversing points A and B, so there will be\nthree options for a traversing point set: (1) point A only; (2) point B only; (3) point\nA and point B simultaneously. Similarly, when there are n target orbits, there will be\n2n traversing points and 3n possibilities for traversing point sets.\n\nWhen both of the traversing points of a certain target orbit are selected, the\nrendezvous orbit to be designed will be closer to the two traversing points and\nfurther away from other traversing points. Hence, when we need to determine the\ntraversing point set, the principles below are to be followed:\n\n(1) For a key target orbit, its two traversing points can be included in the\ntraversing point set.\n\nTable 5.2 Position Coordinates of six traversing points\n\nSerial number of\ntraversing point\n\nAltitude (m) Polar coordinate\nangle (\u00b0)\n\n1 1,200,000.0 30.0\n\n2 1,300,000.0 120.0\n\n3 1,400,000.0 200.0\n\n4 1,250,000.0 250.0\n\n5 1,500,000.0 180.0\n\n6 1,500,000.0 0.0\n\n5.5 Non-Coplanar Heterogeneous Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026 161\n\n\n\n(2) For a general target orbit, just one of its traversing points is to be selected and\nincluded in the traversing point set. The selection of two traversing points\ndepends on the minimum distance between the rendezvous orbit and other\ntraversing points.\n\n(3) When the target orbits are of the same importance, for every target orbit, one\ntraversing point can be selected. Then the specific traversing point set can be\ndecided by the minimum sum of total distances between the rendezvous orbit\nand each traversing point in the traversing point set.\n\n5.5.4 Rendezvous Trajectory: Design Method\n\nThe design of a rendezvous orbit based on traversing point set can only determine the\nsize and shape of the rendezvous orbit and the direction of perigee. A complete ren-\ndezvous orbit can be specified onlywhen the time of perigee passage, s, is determined.\n\nAs to the rendezvous with a single target spacecraft, i.e., when only one\ntraversing point rm; fm\u00bd ? is to be selected, the rendezvous orbit can pass through the\ntraversing point directly. By designing the time of perigee passage of the ren-\ndezvous orbit, the servicing spacecraft can pass through the traversing point along\nthe rendezvous orbit exactly when the target spacecraft also passes through it. The\nrequirement is:\n\ns \u00bc tm ? Em ? e sinEmn \u00f05:17\u00de\n\nFig. 5.18 Comparison of\ndesign results of five\ntraversing points and six\ntraversing points\n\n162 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nHere, for the rendezvous orbit, a is its semi-major axis, e is its eccentricity, and\nn \u00bc ffiffiffiffila3p is its mean angular rate. Em is the eccentric anomaly of the traversing point\nin the rendezvous orbit, and:\n\ntg\nEm\n2\n\n\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1? e\n1\u00fe e\n\nr\ntg\nfm\n2\n\n\u00f05:18\u00de\n\nHowever, it will be more complicated when it comes to the rendezvous with\nmultiple target spacecraft. Firstly, a single rendezvous orbit may not be able to pass\nthrough all traversing points. Secondly, even if it can pass through them all, it may\nnot be able to meet the requirement for the traversing time. Hence, in this section,\nthe control method of orbital rendezvous by separating a rendezvous trajectory\nproposed above will be adopted to determine the time of the perigee passage of the\nrendezvous orbit. It is shown in Fig. 5.19.\n\nApparently, for every traversing point, numerous rendezvous trajectories can be\nseparated from any point of a rendezvous orbit. These trajectories differ from each\nother only in separation velocity and separation time. If there is a constraint on the\nseparation velocity from the rendezvous orbit, some rendezvous trajectories can be\neliminated, yet there are still multiple rendezvous trajectories. In other words, as\nlong as the energy constraint is satisfied, there will be multiple rendezvous tra-\njectories between a point in the rendezvous orbit and a traversing point. And each\ntrajectory has its own separation time, i.e., it corresponds to a time of perigee\npassage.\n\nWe assume a point k expressed as rk; fk; tk\u00bd ? in the rendezvous orbit, and a\ntraversing point i expressed as ri; fi; ti\u00bd ?. The rendezvous trajectory separated from\npoint k and then reaching traversing point i to conduct rendezvous is only related to\ntime difference Dtk \u00bc ti ? tk. We can design the rendezvous trajectory by Lambert\n\nFig. 5.19 Schematic figure of rendezvous trajectory\n\n5.5 Non-Coplanar Heterogeneous Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026 163\n\n\n\nTime Theorem, and figure out the velocity increment needed for separating from the\ntrajectory, namely,\n\nD~vk \u00bc~vki ?~vk\nHere,~vk is the velocity vector of point k in the rendezvous orbit, and~vki is the\n\nvelocity vector of point k in the rendezvous trajectory.\nIf D~vk ?DVmax and DVmax is the maximum separation velocity a servicing\n\nspacecraft can provide, the rendezvous trajectory will be usable. Then corre-\nsponding to tk , the time of perigee passage sk is:\n\nsk \u00bc tk ? Ek ? e sinEkn \u00f05:19\u00de\n\nHere, Ek is the eccentric anomaly of traversing point k in the rendezvous orbit, and\n\ntg\nEk\n2\n\n\u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1? e\n1\u00fe e\n\nr\ntg\nfk\n2\n\n\u00f05:20\u00de\n\nSimilarly, if we find out all sk that meet the requirements above when\n0? tk ? Tp, we can construct a set \u00bdsk? consisting of all rendezvous trajectories\nwhich separate from point k in the rendezvous orbit and then conduct rendezvous\nwith traversing point i on time.\n\nTherefore, for traversing point i, multiple rendezvous trajectories meeting the\nrequirement on energy constraint can be separated from any point in the rendezvous\norbit, i.e., there is a time set of perigee passage. They will form a time set of perigee\npassage for traversing point i and can be written as:\n\n\u00bdsi? \u00bc \u00bdsi1? [ \u00bdsi2? [ ? ? ? [ \u00bdsin?\n\nHere, n is the number of separation points available in the rendezvous orbit.\nIt can be seen that for every traversing point in a traversing point set, there is a\n\ntime set of perigee passage \u00bdsi? i \u00bc 1; ? ? ? ;m\u00f0 \u00de. Here, m is the number of traversing\npoints in the traversing point set. The time of perigee passage when these traversing\npoints all appear is the intersection of these sets, namely,\n\n\u00bds? \u00bc \u00bds1? \\ \u00bds2? \\ ? ? ? \\ \u00bdsm?\n\nFinally, from the intersection set, we can choose the time of perigee passage\nwhich meets the requirements of the mission to the greatest extent.\n\nInversely, if s, the time of perigee passage of the rendezvous orbit, is given, we\ncan also figure out a separable arc section and its corresponding rendezvous\ntrajectory.\n\nNext, we will illustrate the design method above with a simulation case. We\nassume there are three target orbits. Their traversing point sets in the rendezvous\norbit plane are shown in Table 5.3.\n\n164 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nThe goal of an optimized design is to minimize the sum of total velocity\nincrements for the rendezvous with the three traversing points, so the objective\nfunction is:\n\nJ \u00bc min\nX3\ni\u00bc1\n\nDVijDVi ?VL\n\nHere, VL \u00bc 3000 m/s is the maximum separation velocity of each rendezvous\ntrajectory.\n\nTo search for possible solutions to the greatest extent, we include all the six\ntraversing points in the traversing point set to design a rendezvous orbit. The result is:\n\nn \u00bc \u00f07771008:7714; 3:4916e? 017; 4:6824\u00deT\n\nThe optimized design result at the time of perigee passage is shown in Fig. 5.20.\nIt can be seen that the time of perigee passage of the optimal rendezvous orbit is\n\n2045.26 s.

The orbit parameters of the three target satellites are shown in Table 5.4.\n\nRequirements of the design: the total rendezvous time with the three target\nsatellites is 24\u201326 h; the time interval is 2 h; the optimized goal is to minimize the\nsum of total correction speeds.\n\nWe assume that the right ascension of the ascending node is 180\u00b0 and the orbit\ninclination of the rendezvous orbit is 45\u00b0.

Figure 5.23 shows how the separation arc of each traversing point\nchanges as the time of perigee passage varies.\n\nIt can be seen from Fig. 5.23 that it is not the case that every time of perigee\npassage has a corresponding separation arc.

Figure 5.25 shows how the\ntotal correction speed changes when there is a feasible solution for the rendezvous\ntrajectory of all six traversing points.\n\nIt can be seen from Fig. 5.25 that the range of feasible solutions is relatively\nsmall, mainly between 2700 and 3500 s, and, at the same time, the total correction\nspeed is relatively high.\n\nFig. 5.23 Relationship\nbetween time of perigee\npassage of rendezvous orbit\nand separable arc section\n\nFig. 5.24 Minimum\ncorrection speeds of six\ntraversing points\n\n168 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nWith all factors taken into account, we can specify that the time of perigee\npassage corresponding to the optimal rendezvous orbit is 3079.56 s.

The reasons are\nanalyzed below:\n\n\u2022 The period of the rendezvous orbit is relatively close to that of the target orbit.\n\u2022 Time range for the rendezvous is relatively small.\n\nHence, this section suggests that we correct the semi-major axis of the ren-\ndezvous orbit to expand the time difference between the rendezvous orbit period\nand the target orbit period and to expand the time range of the rendezvous. This can\nhelp to expand the range of the separable arc section in the rendezvous orbit.\n\nBased on the example in Sect. 5.5, we will increase the semi-major axis of the\nrendezvous orbit by 300 km and the time range of the rendezvous to 10 h to\nsimulate the optimal design result of a rendezvous with three target satellites.\n\nWe assume that the right ascension of the ascending node of the rendezvous\norbit is 180\u00b0 and the orbit inclination is 45\u00b0. We also increase the semi-major axis\nof the rendezvous orbit by 300 km. After the correction, parameters of the ren-\ndezvous orbit are:\n\nn \u00bc \u00f07:28556e + 006; 0:041125; 5:50577\u00deT\n\nFigure 5.26 shows the separable arc sections in the rendezvous orbit corre-\nsponding to each traversing point. It is basically similar to the situation before the\nsemi-major axis is adjusted, yet the separable time for a single traversing point\nincreases.\n\nFigure 5.27 shows, when there are separable arc sections, the minimum cor-\nrection speed needed for the rendezvous with a target spacecraft passing through\nevery traversing point within the required rendezvous time. It can be seen that the\nshape is basically similar to that before the correction of the semi-major axis.\n\nFigure 5.28 shows, when conducting rendezvous with all target spacecraft, the\nchange of the total correction speed. It can be seen that there is a relatively large\n\nFig. 5.26 Separable arc\nsection of rendezvous orbit\nwhen semi-major axis\nincreases by 300 km and time\nrange is 10 h\n\n170 5 Theory and Design Method of Multi-Target Rendezvous Orbit \u2026\n\n\n\nrange for the feasible solutions, which are mainly between 1200 and 4000 s.\nBesides, compared with the time range of the rendezvous, i.e., 2 h, the range of\nsolutions increases considerably, and the total correction speed decreases greatly.\n\nBased on the simulation result above, we can specify that the time of perigee\npassage of the optimal rendezvous orbit is 2073.24 s. The optimal rendezvous\ntrajectory is shown in Table 5.7.\n\nTable 5.8 shows the design results when time ranges are 2 and 10 h respectively\nand the corrected semi-major axis are 100 and 300 km respectively.\n\nIt can be seen from Table 5.8 that, for the three non-coplanar target satellites in\nLow-Earth-Orbit, the optimal rendezvous plan is to increase the semi-major axis of\nthe rendezvous orbit by 300 km under the 10 h rendezvous time constraint.

The\norbital rendezvous method based on traversing point turns the non-coplanar orbital\nrendezvous problem in space into a coplanar one. This method does not impose any\nrestrictions on the position and the number of orbit planes of the target spacecraft. It\nis a \u201cone-to-many\u201d orbit rendezvous mode in its real sense. In other words, a\nservicing spacecraft can conduct orbit rendezvous with multiple non-coplanar target\nspacecraft without changing its orbit plane. This method greatly reduces the cost of\nmulti-target rendezvous and improves the efficiency of orbital rendezvous. It has\nbroad applications.\n\nAccording to the different orbit configurations of multiple target spacecraft, this\nchapter proposes the multi-target orbital rendezvous method for both non-coplanar\nhomogeneous target spacecraft and non-coplanar heterogeneous target spacecraft.\nBoth methods achieve multi-target rendezvous by the traversing points formed by\nthe target spacecraft in the rendezvous orbit plane. For the rendezvous with multiple\nsatellites in the Walker Constellation, a specific design method of the rendezvous\norbit is given. For the non-coplanar heterogeneous multi-target orbital rendezvous,\nafter offering the design procedures of the rendezvous orbit, we propose the design\nmethods for the rendezvous orbit and the rendezvous trajectory. Finally, through the\nanalysis of a typical simulation case, we propose a correction method of\nnon-coplanar multi-target orbital rendezvous based on the traversing point. It is\nachieved by extending the semi-major axis of the rendezvous orbit and the range of\nrendezvous time. By correcting the rendezvous orbit, the demand for separation\nvelocity can be reduced effectively, thus making the method more practical.\n\n5.6 Simulation Analysis and Method Correction 173\n\n\n\nChapter 6\nTheory and Design Method of Initiative\nApproaching Orbit\n\nWith the improvement of space resolution ratio and communication capacity, the\nspacecraft is becoming heavier, and more costs in manufacturing and launching are\nrequired. So on-orbit services for spacecraft have been put on the agenda.\n\nBesides, human space activities are becoming more frequent and over 90 % of\nspace debris is ineffective or uncontrolled, which pose threats to on-orbit spacecraft.\nThus, a fast or slow approach to on-orbit cooperative or non-cooperative targets has\nbecome the premise and foundation for space missions to carry out on-orbit services\nand space debris cleaning.\n\n6.1 Initiative Approaching Orbit: Concept\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) summarize seven key\nfactors in on-orbit service research in On-Orbit Satellite Servicing Study Project\nReport1: service category, executive body, rendezvous and docking, position, time\ndelay, target design and target attitude. Rendezvous and docking means how a\nservicing spacecraft approaches its target spacecraft which is either cooperative or\nnon-cooperative (Fig. 6.1).\n\nAs the mission requires, the servicing spacecraft takes the initiative to approach\nthe target spacecraft through orbit and attitude control and this process is called\ninitiative approach. After this, space missions, such as rendezvous and docking,\nspace target surveillance, on-orbit service, are accomplished.\n\nThe initiative approach discussed in this section includes the approach phase in\nthe approaching orbit and the final approach phase in the final approaching orbit.\nThe two spacecraft involved are called the approaching spacecraft and the target\nspacecraft respectively.\n\n1NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

The phasing orbit is used to reduce the orbit phase angle between the\napproaching spacecraft and the target spacecraft. After phasing, the approaching\nspacecraft is very close to the target orbit. Then the long-distance rendezvous can be\nconducted. The long-distance approaching orbit shifts the approaching spacecraft to\nthe first position which is very close to the target spacecraft. This process is called\n\u201ctarget seeking\u201d, which aims to further reduce orbit error.\n\nThe final approaching orbit is used to further reduce the relative distance\nbetween the approaching spacecraft and the target spacecraft to meet the final\nconditions of service. It should be noted that the non-centroid relative motion of the\ntarget spacecraft should be considered in the final approaching phase. It not only\ndepends on the relative position of the spacecraft\u2019s centroids, but also involves the\nrelative spacecraft attitude change.\n\n6.2 Approaching Orbit: Design\n\n6.2.1 Phasing Orbit\n\nThe phasing orbit can move the initiative approaching spacecraft to the vicinity of\nthe target spacecraft and reach the target. We suppose the approaching spacecraft\nand the target spacecraft are located in different phases of the same orbit as Fig. 6.2.\n\nIt can be seen that there are two different relative positions for the target\nspacecraft and the approaching spacecraft. Next, analyses of the target spacecraft\u2019s\nphases in Fig. 6.2 are conducted.\n\nIn the first case, when the approaching spacecraft is in the front of the target\nspacecraft (in the direction of motion), there is the advanced angle. Define the phase\ndifference as positive, namely, a[ 0.\n\nFig. 6.1 Research scope of on-orbit service\n\n176 6 Theory and Design Method of Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\n\n\nThe phasing elliptical orbit is used to eliminate the phase difference between the\ntwo spacecraft. Specifically, the approaching spacecraft is maneuvered to a phasing\nelliptical orbit, the perigee of which is the initial orbit maneuver point. The geo-\ncentric distance of the apogee is larger than the radius R of the initial circular orbit.\nWe suppose dh (dh \u00bc ra ? R[ 0) is the difference in height between the apogee of\nthe phasing orbit and the initial circular orbit. When the approaching spacecraft\nreturns to the perigee after completing one circle in the phasing orbit, the operation\nphase of target spacecraft along the initial circular orbit can be defined as 2p\u00fe a. At\nthis point, an impulse is applied to the approaching spacecraft to make it return to\nthe initial circular orbit as Fig. 6.3.\n\nIn the second case, when the approaching spacecraft is behind the target\nspacecraft, there is the receding angle. The phasing difference is negative, namely,\na\\0.\n\nThe approaching spacecraft is first maneuvered onto a phasing elliptical orbit,\nthe apogee of which is the initial orbit maneuver point. The geocentric distance of\nthe perigee is smaller than the radius of the initial circular orbit. We suppose dh\n(dh \u00bc rp ? R\\0) is the difference in height between the phasing orbit\u2019s perigee and\nthe initial circular orbit. When the approaching spacecraft returns to the apogee after\ntravelling one circle in the phasing orbit, the operation phase of the target spacecraft\nalong the initial circular orbit is 2p\u00fe a. At this point, an impulse is applied to the\napproaching spacecraft to make the spacecraft return to the initial circular orbit as\nFig. 6.4.\n\nFollowing the two phasing methods above, the phase difference between the\napproaching spacecraft and the target spacecraft can be eliminated after the\n\nFig. 6.2 Initial phase of\napproaching spacecraft and\ntarget spacecraft\n\n6.2 Approaching Orbit: Design 177\n\n\n\nFig. 6.3 Phasing elliptical\norbit used to eliminate\nadvance angle\n\nFig. 6.4 Phasing elliptical\norbit used to eliminate\nreceding angle\n\n178 6 Theory and Design Method of Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\n\n\napproaching spacecraft completes one full circle in the phasing orbit.

Their relative position in the final approach phase is shown in Fig. 6.7.\n\nSymbols in Fig. 6.7 are defined as follows:\nx0y0z0 ? CM0 represents the body coordinate system which is fixedly connected\n\nwith the target spacecraft, while x1y1z1 ?

CM0 system. Assume P j0 is the optimal capture point in the target\nspacecraft by the approaching spacecraft, and also the point where the approaching\nspacecraft detects the target spacecraft.\n\nPi1 is the position vector of a certain point in the approaching spacecraft in the\nx1y1z1 ? CM1 system. We suppose Pi1 is the front end of the approaching space-\ncraft\u2019s robot arm, and is mounted with a detector.\n\nq is the position vector of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s centroid relative to the\nx0y0z0 ? CM0 system.\n\nqij is the position vector of P\ni\n1 in the approaching spacecraft relative to P\n\nj\n0 in the\n\ntarget spacecraft.\nWe suppose that the target spacecraft rotates at a certain angular velocity. Then\n\nin the final approach toward the target without attitude control, the approaching\nspacecraft needs to keep the attitude tracking to the target spacecraft and qij should\nbe reduced constantly to zero. It can be seen from Fig. 6.2 that qij is not only related\nto q, but also to the relative attitude between these two spacecraft. Therefore, the\nrelative attitude motion and the relative position motion under such circumstance\nshould be analyzed.\n\n6.3.1 Dynamics Model of Relative Attitude\n\nWe suppose that the target spacecraft\u2019s angular velocity is x0, and the approaching\nspacecraft\u2019s angular velocity is x1.

It not only depends on the relative position of the space-\ncraft\u2019s centroids, but also involves the spacecraft\u2019s relative attitude change. There\nare mainly two cases:\n\n1. The target spacecraft with attitude control\nCurrently, most of the spacecraft which are worthy of on-orbit repair are\nthree-axis-stabilized, in addition, their attitude change rate is usually not higher\nthan 0.1\u00b0/s. The final approach strategy for the cooperative rendezvous of those\nthree-axis-stabilized target spacecraft is generally the V-bar straight-line\napproximation or the R-bar straight-line approximation, like the final\napproach towards the International Space Station (ISS) by American space\nshuttles, European ATV and Japanese HTV. However, the target spacecraft may\nnot be able to provide effective information for cooperation in some space\nmissions like on-orbit service and maintenance. For this kind of non-cooperative\nautonomous rendezvous, straight-line approximation in random directions\nshould be considered and docking and capture should be conducted within a\ncertain range around the capture point.\n\n2. The target spacecraft without attitude control\nThe target spacecraft without attitude control is commonly a piece of space\ndebris or some dysfunctional satellites with a faulty attitude and orbit control\nsystem. The uncontrolled target spacecraft rotates around its largest inertia\nprincipal axis. Its attitude change rate is usually not lower than 1\u00b0/s. For these\ntargets, the approaching spacecraft should achieve the tracking and control of\nthe attitude and position relative to the target spacecraft simultaneously, and\nreduce the relative angular velocity to zero. Meanwhile, the approaching\nspacecraft should gradually approach the capture point along a certain capturing\naxis in the target spacecraft\u2019s body coordinate system. However, for those\nspacecraft with a higher rotating angular velocity and without attitude control,\nthe straight-line approximation along the target\u2019s rotation axis can be adopted.\n\n6.4.1 The Final Approach for Three-Axis-Stabilized Target\nSpacecraft\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 6.8, the approaching spacecraft in the target\u2019s orbit coordinate\nsystem is in the initial position r0 when t \u00bc 0, and then arrives at the capture and\ndocking point within the transfer time T (when t \u00bc T).\n\nIn Fig. 6.8, the dotted line from r0 to rT is the reference trajectory of the\nstraight-line approximation, which is denoted with the vector q, while the real\ntrajectory (the bold solid line in Fig. 6.8) under the control thrust may change back\n\n6.4 Ultimate Approaching Orbit: Design 187\n\n\n\nand forth around the reference trajectory. r represents the position of the\napproaching spacecraft at the time t in the target\u2019s orbit coordinate system, and\nq \u00bc r? rT .\n\nWe suppose that the target spacecraft is three-axis-attitude-stabilized, and the\napproaching spacecraft is ultimately to dock at a certain point in the vicinity of the\ntarget spacecraft, so this section only discusses the control of the approaching\nspacecraft\u2019s relative position.\n\nWith the sliding-mode variable structure control, the switching function can be\nexpressed as:\n\nsi \u00bc k1\u00f0r? rd\u00de\u00fe k2 _r \u00f06:39\u00de\n\nHere, r is the position vector of the approaching spacecraft in the target\u2019s orbit\ncoordinate system, and rd represents the expected position vector in the target\u2019s\norbit coordinate system and is same as rT , the position vector of the capture and\ndocking point after the final approach is completed. r and _r can be obtained based\non the C-W equation. If components of control parameters k1 and k2 in the target\u2019s\norbit coordinate system are both positive, then Eq. (6.39) will satisfy:\n\nlim si _si \u00bc 0\nsi\u00f00; ? ? ? ; 0\u00de \u00bc 0\n\n\t\n\u00f06:40\u00de\n\nIt indicates that the sliding-mode motion is asymptotic stable.\nThe external force acceleration ci in the C-W equation is set as the following\n\nswitching control acceleration constants:\n\nci \u00bc\n?T ; si [ 0\n0; si \u00bc 0\nT ; si\\0\n\n8<\n: \u00f06:41\u00de\n\nFig. 6.8 Schematic figure of straight-line approximation for three-axis-stabilized target spacecraft\n\n188 6 Theory and Design Method of Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\n\n\nWe suppose that a thrust can be applied to all of the three axes in the target\u2019s\norbit coordinate system. If the component of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s relative\nposition vector r in the x axis is larger than the expected value (si [ 0), then the\ncontrol thrust should be applied along the x axis in the negative direction. If the\ncomponent of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s relative position vector r in the x axis is\nequal to the expected value, then no thrust is applied along the x axis. If the\ncomponent of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s relative position vector r in the x axis is\nsmaller than the expected value, then the control thrust is applied along the x axis in\nthe positive direction.\n\nAccording to the above analysis, the Simulink model of the straight-line\napproximation under sliding-mode control can be constructed in MATLAB as is\nshown in Fig. 6.9.\n\nIn Fig. 6.9, the C-W module is the relative motion model constructed based on\nthe C-W equation; the Simulink module is the model under sliding-mode control\nconstructed based on Eq. (6.39); and the Switch module switches the control\nacceleration based on the value of si in Eq. (6.39).\n\nThe straight-line approximation simulation conditions for three-axis-stabilized\ntarget spacecraft are set as:\n\n1. The angular velocity of the target orbit:\n\nn \u00bc 7:292? 10?5 rad/s;\nr0 \u00bc \u00bd 104 10 60 ?T m;\n_r0 \u00bc \u00bd 0 0 0 ?T m/s;\nrd \u00bc \u00bd 5 0 2 ?T m:\n\nFig. 6.9 Simulink model under sliding-mode control\n\n6.4 Ultimate Approaching Orbit: Design 189\n\n\n\n2.

Simulation time: 1000 s.\n\nThe variation of the relative velocity and position with time is shown in\nFig. 6.10.\n\nIt can be seen from Fig. 6.10 that the change curve of the relative velocity and\nthe relative position under sliding-mode control can converge quickly in the first\n300 s. When it arrives at rd around the 140th second, the approaching spacecraft\u2019s\nvelocity is nearly zero in the target\u2019s orbit coordinate system. Ultimately, the\napproaching spacecraft can keep in the expected docking position. When we extract\ndata of the relative position and draw a three-dimensional curve, then the\nstraight-line approximation simulation trajectory of the approaching spacecraft in\nthe final approach phase can be obtained as Fig. 6.11.\n\nFigure 6.11 shows that, except the initial phase, the approaching spacecraft can\napproach the docking point along the straight line trajectory in the final approach\nphase. Therefore the sliding-mode variable structure control discussed in this sec-\ntion can achieve the straight-line approximation and control for the high-orbit,\nthree-axis-stabilized and non-cooperative target spacecraft in the final approach\nphase of autonomous rendezvous.\n\nFig. 6.10 Change curve of relative velocity and position under sliding-mode control with time\n\n190 6 Theory and Design Method of Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Final Approach to the Target Without Attitude Control\n\nThe control process of the position and attitude tracking and approaching in the\nfinal approach phase is: firstly, according to the estimation of the relative position\nand attitude, we suppose the current values of the relative attitude, the relative\nattitude angular velocity, the relative position and the relative velocity are obtained.\nThen, by comparing the current values with the nominal values, the deviation value\nbetween them is obtained. Finally, based on the feedback control law, the control\nquantity is generated to eliminate the difference.\n\nFor the controlled targets with relatively large inertia, the dynamic characteristics\nin system adjustment can be improved via Proportion-Differentiation Control (PD\ncontrol). The transfer function under PD control is:\n\nGc\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc KP \u00feKPss \u00f06:42\u00de\n\nHere, KP is the proportional coefficient, and s is the differential time constant.\nThe output signal of the PD controller can be denoted as:\n\nu\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc KPe\u00f0t\u00de\u00feKPs de\u00f0t\u00dedt \u00f06:43\u00de\n\nV-bar\n\nH-b\nar\n\nR\n-b\nar\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n60\n\n80\n100 0 5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nX: 104\nY: 10\nZ: 60\n\nX: 5.194\nY: 0.0163\nZ: 2.039\n\nFig. 6.11 Final approaching trajectory of approaching spacecraft under sliding-mode control\n\n6.4 Ultimate Approaching Orbit: Design 191\n\n\n\n1. Relative attitude and tracking control\n\nWe suppose all of the unknown quantities in the relative attitude motion are\ninterference torque Td, and then Eq. (6.25) can be reduced to:\n\ndx\ndt\n\n\u00bc DI?11 T1 ? DI?11 x1 ? I1x1 ? Td \u00f06:44\u00de\n\nTherefore, the law of the attitude tracking PD control of the approaching\nspacecraft to the target spacecraft can be expressed as follows:\n\nTc \u00bc x1 ? I1x1 ? I1DT\u00f0K1Dq\u00feK2x\u00de \u00f06:45\u00de\n\nAccording to Eqs. (6.20) and (6.21), the Simulink model of spacecraft\u2019s attitude\ndynamics can be constructed as shown in Fig. 6.12.\n\nFigure 6.12 shows the attitude dynamic model of the approaching spacecraft,\nwhich can ultimately output the approaching spacecraft\u2019s angular velocity x1.\nSimilarly, the attitude dynamic model of the target spacecraft can also be obtained.\nIt should be noted that Tc in Fig. 6.12 is the control torque output of the attitude\ntracking PD controller in Eq. (6.45) and can be obtained from the Simulink model\nin Fig. 6.14. However, there is no corresponding input in the target spacecraft\u2019s\nattitude dynamic model.\n\nBased on the Simulink model in Fig. 6.11 and Eq. (6.23), the Simulink model of\nrelative attitude calculation can be constructed as Fig. 6.13.\n\nFive inputs are needed in the model in Fig. 6.13. Input 1 is the attitude dynamics\nof the target spacecraft; input 2 is the attitude dynamics of the approaching\nspacecraft; input 3 is the direction cosine form of the target spacecraft\u2019s angular\nvelocity; input 4 is the direction cosine form of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s angular\nvelocity, and D in Fig. 6.13 is the coordinate transfer matrix from the approaching\nspacecraft\u2019s body coordinate system to the target spacecraft\u2019s body coordinate\nsystem; input 5 is the angular velocity of the target spacecraft. According to\nEq. (6.10), the relative attitude dynamics in the target system can be acquired with\nthese five inputs above.\n\ncT\n\n1I 1Inv(A)\n(3x3)\n\nCross\nProduct\nC=AxB\n\nA\n\nB\nC\n\nFig. 6.12 Simulink model of approaching spacecraft\u2019s attitude dynamics\n\n192 6 Theory and Design Method of Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\n\n\nBased on Eq. (6.45) and the Simulink model in Fig. 6.13 and 6.12, the Simulink\nmodel of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s relative attitude tracking PD controller can\nbe constructed. The model can output the control torque Tc to control the\napproaching spacecraft\u2019s attitude dynamics as Fig. 6.14.\n\n2. Relative position and tracking control\n\nWe suppose that the unknown quantities in the relative position motion are also\ninterference factors, and that the target spacecraft is in slow rotation. To simplify\nthe problem, if the relative attitude has already been already tracked, through\ncontrolling the relative position of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s centroids, the rel-\native position motion between the robot arm\u2019s front end Pi1 and the capture point P\n\nj\n0\n\ncan be realized indirectly.

In its tracking and approaching under the closed\nloop control, the approaching spacecraft needs to conduct the final approach along\nthis axis from 50 meters away. In its final approach, the spacecraft\u2019s relative\nvelocity is 0:1 m/s and it keeps a stable relative attitude.\n\nWe also set the target spacecraft\u2019s orbit angular velocity\nn \u00bc 7:292? 10?5rad=s, its angular velocity of rotation is 1?=s, and\n\nP0 \u00bc \u00f0 2 4 0 \u00deT m\nP1 \u00bc \u00f0 3 4 5 \u00deT m\nI0 \u00bc \u00bd 100 0 0 ; 0 50 0 ; 0 0 50 ?T kgm2\nI1 \u00bc \u00bd 10 0 0 ; 0 10 0 ; 0 0 10 ?T kgm2\n\nWith the Simulink model above, we set 500 s as the simulation time and 0.1 s as\nthe step size, then several curves can be obtained (as is shown in Figs. 6.16, 6.17\nand 6.18), including the variations of the target spacecraft\u2019s attitude Euler angle,\n\nFig. 6.15 Simulink model of relative position tracking control\n\n194 6 Theory and Design Method of Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\n\n\nrelative angular velocity, relative position, relative velocity, the approaching\nspacecraft\u2019s control acceleration and control torque.\n\nIt can be seen from the curve of the target attitude that the target spacecraft is not\nmotionless but rolls and rotates around the x axis of its body coordinate system. The\ncurve of the relative angular velocity in Fig. 6.16 indicates that the relative angular\nvelocity of the approaching spacecraft and the target spacecraft converges to nearly\nzero ultimately, and attitude tracking is achieved.\n\nIt can be seen from Fig. 6.17 that the relative position can finally converge to\nabout zero, indicating that the front end of the approaching spacecraft\u2019s robot arm\nreaches the capture point. The initial fluctuation of the curve is caused by the\nlimiting of the control acceleration. The relative velocity of the approaching\nspacecraft and the target spacecraft converges finally and keeps at about 0.1 m/s.\n\nFigure 6.18 shows that, with the convergence of the relative position and the\nsynchronization of the attitude, the control acceleration reduces from around\n0:1m/s2 to about 0:01m/s2. The control torque first varies from ?1Nm to about\n1Nm, and then converges to around zero.\n\nTo create a simulation scene in STK, it\u2019s necessary to set up the target space-\ncraft\u2019s attitude and orbit data. Meanwhile, according to the simulation data about\nthe relative position and relative attitude, an approaching spacecraft is also set up to\nconduct visual simulation. This is shown in Fig. 6.19.\n\nIn Fig. 6.19, the target spacecraft is rotating around the grey dotted line in bold\n\u2014the rotation axis, the red fine dotted line here is the capture axis fixedly connected\n\nFig. 6.17 Variation curves of relative position and relative velocity\n\nFig. 6.16 Variation curves of target spacecraft\u2019s attitude Euler angle and relative angular velocity\n\n6.4 Ultimate Approaching Orbit: Design 195\n\n\n\nwith the target\u2019s body coordinate system, and it also rotates around the target\nspacecraft\u2019s rotation axis.

It shows that the approaching spacecraft successfully tracks and\napproaches the target without attitude control and reaches the effective capture point.\n\n6.5 Summary\n\nIn the initiative approaching process, an approaching spacecraft, with a target\nspacecraft being the target, through the maneuver control of the relative orbit and\nrelative attitude, finally approaches the target in a specific way. The design of the\ninitiative approaching orbit is an important part in the research on debris clearance\nand on-orbit services.\n\nFig. 6.18 Variation curves of control acceleration and control torque\n\nFig. 6.19 STK simulation of\nposition and attitude tracking\nand approaching\n\n196 6 Theory and Design Method of Initiative Approaching Orbit\n\n\n\nThis chapter first introduces the concept of the initiative approaching orbit, and\nthen presents the target approaching orbit from two aspects: the design of the\nphasing orbit and the short-range approach. Furthermore, specific algorithms of\norbit control are provided. Finally, dynamic models of the relative attitude and\nrelative position between the approaching spacecraft and the target spacecraft are\nconstructed, and for the three-axis-stabilized target spacecraft and the target\nspacecraft without attitude control, strategies for attitude and orbit control are put\nforward. Besides, simulation and analysis are conducted to verify the correctness\nand feasibility of them.\n\n6.5 Summary 197\n\n\n\nChapter 7\nTheory and Design Method\nof Responsive Orbit\n\nAn orbit which meets the demands of fast responsive missions is called a fast\nresponsive orbit. Fast responsive missions mainly aim at emergent geological\nhazard, earthquake, nuclear leakage, and military conflict. These emergencies are\ngenerally unexpected and very destructive and cause huge losses if we cannot get\ninformation timely and act decisively. This chapter will start with the concept of the\nresponsive orbit, and then focus on the theories and design methods of several\ntypical responsive orbits such as the fast access orbit and the fast phasing orbit.\n\n7.1 Fast Responsive Orbit: Concept\n\nA response is a system\u2019s reaction to incentives. It starts when the system receives\nincentives and ends when the system responds. In aerospace application, the\nresponsive time is usually defined as the period of time from the proposal of the\nmission to the moment the mission\u2019s demands are satisfied.\n\nDue to the constraint from the Keplerian orbit, once the spacecraft\u2019s orbit is\ndetermined, its operation law in space and its motion relative to the ground are both\nfixed. Many natural and man-made disasters are highly unexpected. For example,\nthe sea to the east of Miyagi-ken, a prefecture in northeastern Japan, was struck by a\n9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011, triggering a mega tsunami and\ncausing mass casualties. Consequently, power outage occurred successively in the\nsix units of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. Alternate diesel-generators were\ndestroyed, the cooling systems were no longer effective, and then reactors exploded\nin succession. Because the resultant nuclear leakage damaged the environment\nseriously, the detection personnel could hardly enter the disaster-stricken area. In\naddition, owing to the territorial sky and sea restrictions, some countries directly\ninvolved in this disaster, like China, had no access to first-hand data. If a fast\nresponsive spacecraft was available then, near real-time information of high\n\n\u00a9 National Defense Industry Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017\nY. Zhang et al., Theory and Design Methods of Special Space Orbits,\nDOI 10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6_7\n\n199\n\n\n\naccuracy could be obtained, providing firsthand data to aid in the fast formulation of\ncounter-measures.\n\nThis is the case in the civil field. The same is true in the military field. As a\nmatter of fact, the concept of \u201cthe responsive space\u201d was first put forward by the\nU.S. military. In 1999, the United States Air Force (USAF) introduced the concept\nof \u201cthe responsive space\u201d for the first time in its Operational Responsive Space-lift\nMission Needs Statement, or ORSMNS in short. Afterwards, this concept was\nconstantly modified and enriched. In the memorandum of the Deputy Secretary of\nDefense on July 9, 2007, the ORS is defined as \u201cassured space power focused on\ntimely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders\u2019 needs, the capability of fast and\naccurate deploying in space and near space, and the operation of national and\nmilitary assets with affordable costs.\u201d\n\nThe ORS strikes a balance between the emergent space requirements of the Joint\nForce Commanders and the requirements of other users. Meanwhile, the ORS\nprovides \u201ccapacity to respond to unexpected loss or degradation of selected func-\ntions and/or to provide timely availability of tailored or new capabilities\u201d\n(NSPD-40, American Space-lift Strategy). The strategic or long-term demand is not\nthe focal point of ORS, however.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Joint Space Operation Regulations, the ORS synchronizes\nand integrates space technologies and other forces available to the Joint Force\nCommanders in a timely and proactive way.\n\nThe advantages include:\n\n\u2022 Rapid response to the new or improved space technologies required by Joint\nForce Commanders.\n\n\u2022 Fast improvement and strengthening of existing space technologies as desired.\n\u2022 Fast restructure or complement of key space technologies to ensure the opera-\n\ntion, and provide continuous space forces for Joint Force Commanders.\n\nThe limitations are:\n\n\u2022 The shortened time limit which presents challenges to all aspects of the\ndevelopment and deployment process, and also increases risks.\n\n\u2022 The Congress limits maximum expenses and requires detailed explanation of\nJoint Force Commanders\u2019 needs, which may lead to a technical scheme that is\n\u201cjust adequate\u201d.\n\nAn orbit that meets the demand of a fast responsive mission is called a fast\nresponsive orbit. The foremost goal in the design of a responsive orbit is to\naccomplish the mission quickly. The design also takes into account the Keplerian\norbit constraint, the service life and the follow-up application of the spacecraft.\n\nThe fast responsive orbits designed for different responsive missions can be\ndivided into several categories. This chapter will mainly introduce the fast\nfly-around orbit and the fast access orbit.\n\n200 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\n1. Fast fly-around orbit\n\nFlying around means a spacecraft travels around another spacecraft. These two\nspacecraft are called the flying-around spacecraft and the target spacecraft,\nrespectively. The period of the natural flying around is usually equal to the orbital\nperiod of the target spacecraft. For example, it takes 24 h for the target spacecraft in\nthe earth-synchronous orbit to fly in a complete circle around the Earth. This natural\nflying around is designed on the basis of the orbit\u2019s mechanical characteristics and\nthe short-range relative motion equation. Relevant studies have recently matured.\n\nThe period of the natural flying around is equal to the orbital period of the target\nspacecraft, which is inconvenient in practical uses such as in the comprehensive\nobservation of GEO satellites and the fast checking and maintenance of space\nstations. With the natural flying around, 24 h is needed for a 360\u00b0 observation of\nthe GEO satellite. Owing to the characteristics of the GEO, the spacecraft is in the\nshadow area for a while (a few minutes to an hour), so the visible light camera can\u2019t\nform images. With the fast flying around, only a few hours is needed to finish the\nobservation and the shadow area can also be avoided. This can even be done in tens\nof minutes. So the fast flying around method is more practical.\n\nIn addition, to inspect and maintain the space station quickly, the inspecting\nspacecraft is required to fly around the target in a very short time so that the\nproblem can be fixed rapidly. The XSS-10 satellite of the US XSS plan is a typical\ncase of the fast flying around method.\n\nThe XSS plan aims to develop a micro satellite under fully-autonomous control.\nThis kind of satellite can be used for on-orbit inspection, rendezvous and docking,\nand short-range maneuver around the on-orbit target. The XSS satellite will ulti-\nmately enhance the ability of the US Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) in space\nrepair and maintenance, and other special space missions. The XSS-10 satellite, the\nfirst micro satellite of the XSS plan, was launched into orbit by the Delta-2 rocket\non January 29, 2003. The XSS-10 satellite was in service for only 24 h and mainly\nworked to demonstrate and verify the short-range inspection between spacecraft and\nthe autonomous navigation technology. It successfully conducted the demonstration\nand verification test of the fast flying around in the 10-minute period (Fig. 7.1).\n\n2. Fast access orbit\n\nIf there is an emergency but no appropriate spacecraft to deal with it, a new\nspacecraft must be launched from the ground. That is to say, the spacecraft must be\ntested and launched into orbit as soon as possible and then arrive at the region of\ninterest or the vicinity of the target spacecraft at the appointed time so that it can\nobtain highly accurate information and support the decision making on the ground.\nFor instance, the responsive orbit in Fig. 7.2 can be applied in covering the\nFukushima area in Japan. After being launched into the responsive orbit, the\nsatellite can arrive at the space over Fukushima and conduct the first reconnaissance\nwithin ten minutes and then the second reconnaissance after one and a half hours.\n\n7.1 Fast Responsive Orbit: Concept 201\n\n\n\nFig. 7.1 Mission of XSS-10\n\nFig. 7.2 Responsive orbit designed for Fukushima\n\n202 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\nThe reconnaissance result can be transmitted back to the ground in real time using\nthe data relay satellite and provide decision support for the formulation of coun-\ntermeasures on the ground.\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit\n\nGenerally speaking, a natural fly-around doesn\u2019t need an external force and the\nfly-around relative trajectory is elliptical. The fly-around period is also fixed (equal\nto the orbital period of the target spacecraft). However, a circular fast fly-around\nrequires an external force. In this case, the fly-around spacecraft can fly with the\ntarget spacecraft periodically along the circular fly-around trajectory within a short\ndesignated time.\n\n7.2.1 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit: Design\n\nWhen the initial state of the fly-around spacecraft meets certain conditions, the\nelliptical natural flying around the target spacecraft can be achieved. But it takes an\norbital period to fly a circle. If the fly-around spacecraft needs to fly around the\ntarget spacecraft in a shorter time, or must keep a constant distance to the target\nspacecraft for some special reasons, the circular fast fly-around method is adopted.\nIt can be divided into in-plane circular fast fly-around and out-of-plane circular fast\nfly-around.\n\n1. In-plane circular fast fly-around\n\nThe in-plane circular fast fly-around means that the fly-around trajectory of the\nfly-around spacecraft is in the orbit plane of the target spacecraft and the trajectory\nis circular.\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 7.3, rfa is the fly-around radius, _afa is the fly-around angular\nvelocity, and afa \u00bc _afat.\n\nfa?&\n\nfar\n\nV-bar\n\nR-bar\n\nfa?\n\n0x\nFig. 7.3 Schematic figure of\nin-plane circular fast\nfly-around\n\n7.1 Fast Responsive Orbit: Concept 203\n\n\n\nWe assume that the in-plane clockwise circular fly-around starts from the ?V-\nbar, and the motion equations are:\n\nx \u00bc ?rfa cos\u00f0 _afat\u00de\nz \u00bc rfa sin\u00f0 _afat\u00de\n\n?\n\u00f07:1\u00de\n\nThe fly-around spacecraft needs to meet the following condition at the initial\nfly-around point.\n\nx0 z0 _x0 _z0\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ?rfa 0 0 rfa _afa\u00f0 \u00de \u00f07:2\u00de\n\nIf we ignore the influence of perturbation, the thrust acceleration applied to the\nfly-around circle is:\n\ncx \u00bc ?rfa _afa\u00f02x? _afa\u00de cos\u00f0 _afat\u00de\ncz \u00bc ?rfa\u00f0 _a2fa ? 2x _afa \u00fe 3x2\u00de sin\u00f0 _afat\u00de\n\n?\n\u00f07:3\u00de\n\nHere, x is the angular velocity of the target spacecraft\u2019s orbit. The instantaneous\nvelocity at any point on the fly-around circle is:\n\n_x \u00bc rfa _afa sin\u00f0 _afat\u00de\n_z \u00bc rfa _afa cos\u00f0 _afat\u00de\n\n?\n\u00f07:4\u00de\n\nGiven that the fly-around radius r is 120 m, and the angular velocity of the fast\nfly-around is k (k = 2, 3, 4) times that of the target\u2019s orbit, the change curve of the\nthrust acceleration with time can be shown in Fig. 7.4.\n\nIt can be seen that the variation of the thrust with time follows a periodical sine\ncurve, and the period is 1k that of the target\u2019s orbit. Meanwhile, as the value of\n\nFig. 7.4 Relation between\nthrust acceleration and\nfly-around velocity in in-plane\ncircular fly-around\n\n204 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\nk becomes bigger, the maximum and minimum values of the thrust acceleration\nwithin a fly-around period will both increase.\n\nWe suppose k = 2, namely, the fly-around velocity is twice the angular velocity\nof the target spacecraft\u2019s orbit. With different fly-around radiuses (100, 120, and\n150 m), the change curves of the thrust acceleration with time can be shown in\nFig. 7.5.\n\nIt is clear that, with the increase of the fly-around radius, the maximum value of\nthe thrust within a period becomes bigger.\n\n2. Out-of-plane circular fast fly-around\n\nIn the out-of-plane circular fast fly-around, there is an included angle between\nthe fly-around trajectory of the fly-around spacecraft and the orbit plane of the target\nspacecraft, and the trajectory is circular.\n\nWe assume that the initial point of the out-of-plane circular fly-around is on the\n+R-bar, the distance between it and the target is rfa, the fly-around angular velocity\nis _afa, and the fly-around angle (the angle the fly-around spacecraft travels on the\nfly-around circle from the initial point) is afa. The fly-around trajectory intersects\nwith the R-bar, and the included angle between the fly-around plane and the\nx\u2013z plane is h.\n\nAs the geometrical relationship in Fig. 7.6 shows, the motion equations of the\nfly-around spacecraft in the target orbit coordinate system can be expressed as:\n\nx \u00bc rfa cos h sin\u00f0afa\u00de\ny \u00bc rfa sin h sin\u00f0afa\u00de\nz \u00bc rfa cos\u00f0afa\u00de\n\n8<\n: \u00f07:5\u00de\n\nThen the fly-around spacecraft needs to satisfy the following condition at the\ninitial point:\n\nFig. 7.5 Relation between\nthrust acceleration and\nfly-around radius in in-plane\nfly-around\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit 205\n\n\n\nx0 y0 z0 _x0 _y0 _z0\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0 0 rfa rfa cos h rfa sin h 0\u00f0 \u00de \u00f07:6\u00de\n\nA continuous thrust must be imposed onto the spacecraft, and the thrust accel-\neration is:\n\ncx \u00bc ?rfa _a2fa\u00f0cos h sin\u00f0 _afat\u00de ? 2n cos\u00f0 _afat\u00de\u00de\ncy \u00bc ?rfa sin h sin\u00f0 _afat\u00de\u00f0 _a2fa sin h\u00fe n2\u00de\ncz \u00bc ?rfa cos\u00f0 _afat\u00de\u00f0 _a2fa ? 2n cos h\u00fe 3n2\u00de\n\n8><\n>: \u00f07:7\u00de\n\nThe instantaneous velocity at any point on the fly-around circle is:\n\n_x \u00bc rfa _afa cos h cos\u00f0 _afat\u00de\n_y \u00bc rfa _afa sin h cos\u00f0 _afat\u00de\n_z \u00bc ?rfa _afa sin\u00f0 _afat\u00de\n\n8<\n: \u00f07:8\u00de\n\nWe suppose that the included angle between the fly-around plane and the\nx\u2013z plane is 30\u00b0, the fly-around radius r is 120 m, and the angular velocity of the\nfast fly-around is k (k = 2, 3, 4) times that of the target\u2019s orbit. The variation curve\nof the thrust acceleration with time is shown in Fig. 7.7.\n\nAs revealed in Fig. 7.7, in the out-of-plane fly-around, the fly-around velocity\nhas little effect on the thrust acceleration. This is mainly because the thrust accel-\neration is used to support the out-of-plane motion, namely, the motion in the\nZ direction. Figure 7.8 shows the relation between the thrust acceleration in the\nZ direction and the fly-around velocity.\n\nWe suppose k = 2, namely, the fly-around velocity is twice that of the target\nspacecraft. With different fly-around radiuses (100, 120, and 150 m), the change\ncurve of the combined thrust acceleration with time is shown in Fig. 7.9.\n\nFig. 7.6 Schematic figure of\nout-of-plane fast circular\nfly-around\n\n206 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\nFig. 7.7 Relation between\nthrust acceleration and\nfly-around velocity in\nout-of-plane circular fast\nfly-around\n\nFig. 7.8 Relation between\nthrust acceleration in Z\ndirection and fly-around\nvelocity in out-of-plane\nfly-around\n\nFig. 7.9 Relation between\nthrust and fly-around radius in\nout-of-plane fly-around\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit 207\n\n\n\nIt is clear that, as the fly-around radius increases, the maximum value of the\nthrust in a period will also increase, but the change is small.\n\n7.2.2 Target Forbidden Zone: Definition\n\nThe target forbidden zone, also known as the safety zone of the target spacecraft, is\nan important factor in determining whether the fly-around trajectory is safe or not.\nThe target forbidden zone can be expressed by a sphere with the target spacecraft as\nits center. Its radius rKOZ observes the following condition:\n\nrSR ? rKOZ ? rTE \u00fe 2\u00f0rSE \u00feDGNC \u00feDPM\u00de \u00f07:9\u00de\n\nHere, rSR is the valid detection scope of the fly-around spacecraft\u2019s detection\npayload. rTE is the maximum one among the extended radiuses of the target\nspacecraft\u2019s body, its solar array and the parabolic antenna. rSE is the fly-around\nspacecraft\u2019s envelope radius. DPM is the fly-around spacecraft\u2019s position measuring\nprecision. DGNC is the control precision of the fly-around spacecraft\u2019s GNC system.\n\nIf the spherical forbidden zone is projected into the x\u2013z plane of the target orbit\ncoordinate system, a corresponding circular forbidden zone can be obtained. It is\nshown in Fig. 7.10.\n\nWe can take the TDRS-1 satellite in the GEO as an example. The extended\nlengths of its solar array and parabolic antenna are about 11 m and 7 m, respec-\ntively. Therefore, assumptions about the factors which influence its target forbidden\nzone can be made, as is shown in Table 7.1.\n\nWhen we substitute the values in Table 7.1 into Eq. (7.9), then the value range\nof rKOZ is: 20 km? rKOZ ? 47m.\n\nDue to the strong sensitivity of the high-orbit environment to collisions, the\ntarget forbidden zone should have adequate safety boundaries. Thus the target\nforbidden zone\u2019s radius in high-orbit fast circular fly-around orbit is usually\ndesigned as: rHKOZ \u00bc 2rKOZ .\n\nSRr\n\nx\n\nz\n\n)2( SE GNC PMr + ? + ?\n\nCZr\n\nTEr\n\nFig. 7.10 Schematic figure\nof circular forbidden zone\n\n208 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Safety Analysis\n\nIt is known from the fly-around radius that, to achieve safe fly-around in the\nx\u2013z orbit plane, the following condition must be satisfied:\n\nx2 \u00fe z2 ? r2KOZ \u00f07:10\u00de\n\nIf a continuous thrust is applied according to Eq. (7.7), the fast circular\nfly-around can achieve active safety. To test the passive safety of this fast circular\nfly-around, the situation of whether the fly-around spacecraft will enter into the\ntarget forbidden zone after the thrust disappears should be considered.\n\nWe suppose that the thruster fails after the fly-around spacecraft arrives at a\ncertain point on the fly-around circle. At this moment, the angle the spacecraft has\ncovered is afailure. According to Eqs. (7.1) and (7.4), the state of the fly-around\nspacecraft at the thrust failure point can be expressed as follows:\n\nXfailure \u00bc\n?rfa cos\u00f0afailure\u00de\nrfa sin\u00f0afailure\u00de\n_afarfa sin\u00f0afailure\u00de\n_afarfa cos\u00f0afailure\u00de\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00f07:11\u00de\n\nAccording to the state above, the free flight trajectory of the fly-around space-\ncraft after the thruster fails is:\n\nXfree \u00bc Ux?z\u00f0s\u00deXfailure \u00f07:12\u00de\n\nThe free flight trajectory after the thruster fails is simulated and calculated with\nMATLAB. In the reference trajectory of the circular fly-around, eight points, from\n0\u00b0 and at an interval of 45\u00b0, are selected as the failure points. We assume the radius\nof the target forbidden zone is 100 m, the fly-around radius is 120 m, and the\nangular velocity of the circular fly-around is still n. Ignoring the influence of\nperturbation, the simulation result is shown in Fig. 7.11.\n\nIt can be seen that, if the angular velocity of the circular fly-around is n, the\ntrajectory is closed only when afailure \u00bc 0?; 180?. In this case, the closed trajectory\nenters into the target forbidden zone, so its safety is low. However, at other failure\npoints, it can always stay far away from the reference trajectory, and its safety is\nguaranteed. But it is not easy for the fly-around spacecraft to return to the reference\ntrajectory after the problem is solved.\n\nTable 7.1 Assumptions about factors that influence TDRS-1 target forbidden zone\n\nrTE rSR DPM DGNC rSE\n12 m 20 km 5 m 5 m 8 m\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit 209\n\n\n\nBelow, the impact of different fly-around angular velocities on the free trajec-\ntories when afailure \u00bc 0?; 45?; 90?; 135? will be analyzed. It is shown in Fig. 7.12.\n\nIt is clear from Fig. 7.12 that, when the fly-around angular velocity _afa \u00bc 2n, the\ntrajectories of the failure points are all elliptical. Next, a mathematical derivation of\nthis case will be conducted.\n\nThe free flight trajectories when afailure \u00bc 180?; 225?; 270?; 315? are cen-\ntrosymmetric with those when afailure \u00bc 0?; 45?; 90?; 135?. So the analysis will not\nbe repeated.\n\nWe suppose that the angular velocity of the circular fly-around is:\n\n_afa \u00bc 2n \u00f07:13\u00de\n\nFig. 7.11 Trajectory simulation after thruster fails at failure points in fast circular fly-around\n\n210 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\nWhen we expand Eq.

(7.14), the following can be obtained:\n\nxfree?3rfa cos\u00f0afailure\u00de\n2rfa\n\n\u00bc sin\u00f0afailure\u00de sin\u00f0ns\u00de ? 2 cos\u00f0afailure\u00de cos\u00f0ns\u00de\nzfree\nrfa\n\n\u00bc sin\u00f0afailure\u00de cos\u00f0ns\u00de\u00fe 2 cos\u00f0afailure\u00de sin\u00f0ns\u00de\n\n(\n\u00f07:15\u00de\n\nIf we square both sides of the above equations and add them, the following can\nbe obtained:\n\n\u00f0xfree ? 3rfa cos\u00f0afailure\u00de\u00de2\n\u00f02rfa\u00de2\n\n\u00fe \u00f0zfree\u00de\n2\n\n\u00f0rfa\u00de2\n\u00bc 1\u00fe 3 cos2\u00f0afailure\u00de \u00f07:16\u00de\n\nFig. 7.12 Free trajectories with different failure points as fast fly-around angular velocity\nincreases\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit 211\n\n\n\nIt can be seen from Eq. (7.16) that, when the angular velocity of the circular\nfly-around is 2n, the free trajectory is always elliptical wherever the thruster of the\nfly-around spacecraft fails in the fast fly-around circle. It accords with the simu-\nlation result. Therefore, the free trajectory in such a case is called a \u201cfree ellipse\u201d.\n\nThe center of the free ellipse is on the V-bar. Its x coordinate is 3rfa cos\u00f0afailure\u00de.\nThe semi-major axis is 2rfa\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u00fe 3 cos2\u00f0afailure\u00de\n\np\n, and the semi-minor axis is\n\nrfa\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u00fe 3 cos2\u00f0afailure\u00de\n\np\n. The free ellipse is tangent to the reference trajectory, and\n\nthe coordinates of the tangency point are:\n\nxtan\nztan\n\n? ?\n\u00bc ?rfa cos\u00f0afailure\u00de?rfa sin\u00f0afailure\u00de\n\n? ?\n\u00f07:17\u00de\n\nEquation (7.17) shows that, if afailure \u00bc 0; p, then there is only one tangency\npoint within a single period between the free ellipse and the reference trajectory,\nand it is \u00f0 rfa 0 \u00de or \u00f0?rfa 0 \u00de. If afailure 6\u00bc 0; p, then there are two tangency points\nwithin a single period between the free ellipse and the reference trajectory.\n\nIt can be seen from the above analysis that, because the free ellipse is tangent to\nthe reference trajectory of the circular fly-around, as long as the reference trajectory\nis designed according to Eq. (7.10), the free ellipse can also satisfy Eq. (7.10). In\nthis way, the passive safety of the fly-around spacecraft along the trajectory can be\nguaranteed even if the thruster fails at any point.\n\nOnce the fly-around spacecraft is restored and back to normal, it can return to the\nreference trajectory utilizing this tangency relationship if a continuous thrust is\nimposed on the position denoted by Eq. (7.17). It can be derived from Eq. (7.3) that\nthe continuous thrust only has a component in the radial direction and it is:\n\ncz \u00bc ?3rfan\n2 sin\u00f0afailure \u00fe 2nt\u00de \u00f0return at afailure\u00de\n\n3rfan2 sin\u00f0afailure ? 2nt\u00de \u00f0return at 2p? afailure\u00de\n?\n\n\u00f07:18\u00de\n\nIt can be seen that, if the fly-around angular velocity is twice that of the target\nspacecraft\u2019s orbit, the balance between safety, fuel and time can be achieved, that is:\n\n\u2022 Its fly-around period is only half of the natural fly-around period, and the\nfly-around spacecraft can keep a constant distance to the non-cooperative target\n(s) so that the detector can work in a stable way.\n\n\u2022 The reference trajectory will not enter into the target forbidden zone. Once the\nthruster fails, the free trajectory of the fly-around spacecraft is an ellipse tangent\nto the reference circle and will not enter into the target forbidden zone. In this\nway both active and passive safety are achieved.\n\n\u2022 The fly-around spacecraft doesn\u2019t need to move far away before it conducts\nmaneuver and returns. It can go back to the pre-set circular fly-around mission\nthrough the tangency point between the free ellipse and the reference circle.\n\n212 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\nSimilar to the in-plane fly-around, to achieve the safe out-of-plane fly-around,\nthe following condition is required:\n\nx2 \u00fe y2 \u00fe z2 ? r2KOZ \u00f07:19\u00de\n\nLikewise, we can assume the thruster of the fly-around spacecraft fails at a\ncertain point on the fly-around circle and the angle it has covered at this time is\nafailure. The state of the fly-around spacecraft at the failure point can be obtained\naccording to Eqs. (7.5) and (7.8).\n\nrfa cos h sin\u00f0afailure\u00de\nrfa sin h sin\u00f0afailure\u00de\nrfa cos\u00f0afailure\u00de\nrfa _afa cos h cos\u00f0afailure\u00de\nrfa _afa sin h cos\u00f0afailure\u00de\n?rfa _afa sin\u00f0afailure\u00de\n\n2\n6666664\n\n3\n7777775\n\n\u00f07:20\u00de\n\nAccording to Eq. (7.20), the free trajectory after the thruster fails is:\n\nXfree \u00bc Uxyz\u00f0s\u00deXfailure \u00f07:21\u00de\n\nTo ensure the passive safety of the free trajectory at the failure point, the fol-\nlowing condition is required:\n\nx2free \u00fe y2free \u00fe z2free ? r2KOZ \u00f07:22\u00de\n\nThe free trajectory after the thruster fails is also simulated and computed with\nMATLAB. In the fast fly-around reference trajectory, eight points from 0\u00b0 at an\ninterval of 45\u00b0 are selected as failure points. We suppose the radius of the target\nforbidden zone is 100 m, h is 45\u00b0, the fast fly-around radius is 120 m, and the\nangular velocity of the fast fly-around is still n. Ignoring the influence of pertur-\nbation, the simulation result is shown in Fig. 7.13.\n\nIt can be seen that, the trajectories in the out-of-plane fly-around are far more\ncomplex than those in the in-plane fly-around. It is hard to obtain from Fig. 7.13 the\nrelation between the free trajectory and the target forbidden zone after thrust failure.\nSo next, the relative distances between free trajectories and the target forbidden\nzone (100 m) after the thrust failure at different angular velocities will be illustrated\nin Fig. 7.14.\n\nAccording to Fig. 7.14, when h \u00bc 45?, the free trajectory can stay out of the\ntarget forbidden zone within two orbital periods as the fly-around angular velocity\nincreases. In such cases, the out-of-plane fast circular fly-around enjoys relatively\nhigh passive safety.\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit 213\n\n\n\nAs revealed in Eq. (7.20), if rfa is determined, the trajectory after the thruster\nfails at a point in the out-of-plane fast circular fly-around is related to _afa, h and\nafailure. Obviously, their relationship is quite complicated. We know the failure point\ncannot to be predicted. The free trajectory of the fly-around spacecraft enters into\n\nFig. 7.13 Trajectory simulation with different failure points in out-of-plane fast circular\nfly-around\n\nFig. 7.14 Relative distances at different fly-around angular velocities when h \u00bc 45?\n\n214 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\nthe target forbidden zone as long as the thruster fails at a certain point on the\nfly-around circle, namely,\n\nqin \u00bc min\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nx2free \u00fe y2free \u00fe z2free\n\nq\n? rKOZ\n\n? ?\n\\0 \u00f07:23\u00de\n\nThe fast fly-around circle cannot be considered passively safe. Hence, we need\nto analyze the passive safety of the fly-around spacecraft\u2019s free trajectories with\ndifferent values of _afa and h.\n\nTherefore, if rfa is determined, a triple-loop structure can be designed, and the\nloops from the outside to the inside are: the first one is the for loop of the fast\nfly-around angular velocity _afa from low to high; the second one is the for loop of\nthe included angle between the fly-around plane and the x? z plane from low to\nhigh; the last one is the for loop of afailure from low to high. The flow chart of this\nprocess is as follows Fig. 7.15.\n\nIt should be noted that this is similar to the in-plane fly-around. When the value\nof afailure varies from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0, the free trajectory in the first half 180\u00b0 is sym-\nmetric with that in the second half 180\u00b0 relative to the origin of the TOF coordinate\nsystem. When the value of h varies from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0, the free trajectory in the first\nhalf 180\u00b0 is symmetric with that in the second half 180\u00b0 relative to the x\u2013z plane.\nHence, we only need to consider the cases when the values of afailure and h vary\nfrom 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nIn simulation and computing, the fly-around radius rfa is 120 m, and the target\u2019s\norbit angular velocity is 7:292? 10?5 rad=s. Ignoring the influence of perturbation,\nthe free flight trajectory after the thruster fails is expanded by two orbital periods.\nAccording to the final results, a surface color map and a plane color map are drawn\nas Figs. 7.16 and 7.17 show respectively.\n\nIn Figs. 7.16 and 7.17, each color block indicates how far the free trajectory\ndetermined by the corresponding _afa and h enters into the forbidden zone, namely,\nqin in Eq. (7.23). The bigger the color block\u2019s value, the smaller the value of qin.\nThis indicates that the free trajectory enters more deeply into the target forbidden\nzone and the passive safety of the fly-around circle is lower. It can be seen that,\nwhen rfa \u00bc 120 m, the bigger the angular velocity of the fast fly-around and the\nincluded angle between the fly-around plane and the x\u2013z plane, the higher the\npassive safety of the fast fly-around. However, the free trajectory may enter into the\ntarget forbidden zone when the thruster fails under some circumstances, which is\ndenoted by the color blocks of high value in Figs. 7.16 and 7.17. Therefore, _afa and\nh corresponding to the color blocks of small value should be selected in practical\napplication.\n\nThere is a precondition for the above analysis, i.e., rfa \u00bc 120 m. If the fly-around\nradius changes, the values of qin brought about by different _afa, h and afailure should\nalso be calculated. The results are as follows Fig. 7.18.\n\nIt can be seen that, as the fly-around radius constantly increases, the value of qin\nbecomes bigger and the less the free trajectory enters into the target forbidden zone.\nrfa is proportional to qin as follows:\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit 215\n\n\n\nFig. 7.15 Flow chart designed to determine whether free trajectory enters into target forbidden\nzone\n\n216 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\nFig. 7.16 Surface color map the free trajectory enters into target forbidden zone when\nrfa \u00bc 120m\n\nFig. 7.17 Plane color map the free trajectory enters into target forbidden zone when rfa \u00bc 120m\n\n7.2 Circular Fast Flying-Around Orbit 217\n\n\n\nqin \u00bc 0:00675rfa ? 99:975 \u00f07:24\u00de\n\nThus in the high-orbit non-cooperative autonomous rendezvous, we should try to\nmake qin ? 0. In other words, only when the value of rfa is bigger than 14.8 km can\nwe guarantee that the fly-around spacecraft in the fast circular fly-around will not\nenter into the target forbidden zone under any circumstances.\n\n7.3 Fast Access Orbit\n\nWhen disasters like earthquakes, nuclear leakages and military conflicts happen, to\nhave a timely understanding of the emergency, some new spacecraft need to be\nlaunched from the ground. If the spacecraft can reach the space orbit rapidly, the\nobservation data regarding the region of interest can be obtained as quickly as\npossible. Therefore, the most salient feature of a fast access orbit is its rapid\nresponsiveness. After an emergency occurs, a fast access orbit can transmit the\ninformation to users within just a few hours.\n\nThe response time of the fast access orbit is defined as:\n\nTResponse \u00bc TPrepare \u00fe TWaitWindow \u00fe TLaunchTime \u00fe TOrbitMission \u00f07:25\u00de\n\nHere, TPrepare is the launch preparation time; TWaitWindow is the waiting time for\nlaunch window; TLaunchTime is the time from launching the spacecraft to its entering\n\nFig. 7.18 Depths to which free trajectory enters into target forbidden zone as rfa changes\n\n218 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\ninto the predetermined orbit; TOrbitMission is the orbit response time which starts\nwhen the spacecraft enters into the orbit and ends when the ground receives the first\nbatch of data, or the communication and navigation services begin.\n\n7.3.1 Low-Earth-Orbit Fast Access Orbit: Design\n\nThe Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) fast access orbit was first put forward by Microcosm,\nwhich aimed to acquire firsthand information as soon as possible in order to\nrespond timely to an emergency. The LEO fast access orbit is mainly used for\nreconnaissance on sensitive regions. Its design principle is shown in Table 7.2.\n\nFor any launch site, if the launching azimuth is not considered, two fast access\norbits can be designed to cover any point on Earth. One is anterograde and the other\nis retrograde as shown in Fig. 7.19.\n\nFor an appointed target, the orbit can be determined by selecting a launching\nazimuth. The major steps are:\n\n\u2022 Set a launch site and obtain its longitude and latitude;\n\u2022 Select a target and obtain its longitude and latitude;\n\u2022 Determine the observation requirements, including the resolution of ground\n\nimaging and the regression period. Determine the altitude and eccentricity of the\norbit.\n\n\u2022 According to the launch time TLaunchTime, and the positions of the launch site and\nthe target, obtain the orbit elements of the LEO fast access orbit.\n\nWe can use an example here. If the launch site is in Xichang, China, the target is\nFukushima, Japan, and the orbit is a recursive circular orbit with 15 days as a\nperiod, then the design is shown in Fig. 7.20.\n\nLimited by the minimum elevation in optical reconnaissance (30\u00b0), the fast\naccess orbit thus designed covers the target area as Fig. 7.21.\n\nIt can be seen that the satellite in the fast access orbit can cover the target area\ntwice a day, satisfying the design requirements.\n\nTable 7.2 Design principle of LEO fast access orbit\n\nSerial\nnumber\n\nDesign principle Method\n\n1 Cover the target within 90 min after\nbeing launched\n\nEnters into the orbit covering the target in\nthe first circle\n\n2 Repeatedly observe per day Via recursive orbit\n\n3 Observe twice a day if possible Observed once when the orbit ascends\nand once when it descends\n\n7.3 Fast Access Orbit 219\n\n\n\nFig. 7.19 Coverage of any point on Earth from any launch site\n\nFig. 7.20 Fast access orbit designed for Fukushima\n\n220 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Cobra Orbit: Design\n\nThe Cobra orbit was first brought up by John Draim, aiming to provide highly\nefficient communication support for middle-longitude regions. Through reasonable\ndesign, a Cobra orbit can cover regions of specific longitude and latitude at a specific\ncommunication time. The Cobra orbit has big eccentricity (800 km ? 27,000 km).\nIts orbit inclination is the critical inclination 63:4?\u00f0 \u00de, so its apogee and perigee do not\nrevolve. Hence the Cobra orbit can keep stable for a long time.\n\nWe can take the communication coverage of China as an example. The design\nsteps of a Cobra orbit is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Design the orbit: the altitudes of the apogee and the perigee are 27,000 and\n800 km, respectively; the orbit inclination is 63.4\u00b0;\n\n\u2022 Determine the region of interest, and set the orbit\u2019s apogee over this region;\n\u2022 Set the time when the satellite passes the apogee as the expected time.\n\nFollowing the steps above, the Cobra orbit used to provide communication\ncoverage for China can be designed as Figs. 7.22, 7.23.\n\nWe suppose that the minimum elevation required in communication is 10\u00b0. The\nspacecraft in the Cobra orbit can support the communication for seven hours in an\neight-hour orbital period (Fig. 7.24).\n\nAccording to the Cobra orbit\u2019s coverage, a network formed by three to four\nspacecraft in the Cobra orbit can achieve continuous coverage of China, so it is very\npractical.\n\nFig. 7.21 Time on observing Fukushima\n\n7.3 Fast Access Orbit 221\n\n\n\nFig. 7.22 Cobra orbit designed to provide communication coverage for China\n\nFig. 7.23 Ground track of Cobra orbit\n\n222 7 Theory and Design Method of Responsive Orbit\n\n\n\n7.4 Summary\n\nThe fast responsive orbit significantly shortens the response time at the cost of some\ntraditional performance indexes like coverage and service life, which makes it\nsuperior in carrying out emergent space missions. The fast responsive orbit is\ndirectly related to space missions, so it is highly oriented. This chapter mainly\nfocuses on two such responsive orbits, i.e., the fast fly-around orbit and the fast\naccess orbit. There are other types not dealt with here. Readers can come up with\nother fast responsive orbits according to their practical demands.\n\nFig. 7.24 Coverage of China from spacecraft in Cobra orbit (within one period)\n\n7.4 Summary 223\n\n\n\nChapter 8\nTheory and Design Method of Earth\nPole-Sitter Orbit\n\nDuring the late 1970s and the early 1980s, inspired by the science fiction work Two\nPlanets, Driver described a spacecraft which was able to hover over the Earth\u2019s\npoles for a long time, and the earth pole-sitter orbit is exactly the orbit designed for\nthis spacecraft.\n\n8.1 Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit: Concept\n\nAn earth pole-sitter is a spacecraft that hovers over the South Pole or the North Pole\nof the Earth and flies in the earth pole-sitter orbit. The ground track of the spacecraft\nis always around the South Pole or the North Pole, and in this way, the spacecraft\nachieves the long-time coverage of the South Pole or the North Pole.\n\nThe spacecraft operating in the earth pole-sitter orbit are on the rotation axis of\nthe Earth. Seen from space, the spacecraft seems to be residing on the South Pole or\nthe North Pole of the Earth. If the distance between the spacecraft and the South\nPole or the North Pole remains unchanged, then in the Earth-fixed coordinate\nsystem, the spacecraft will remain static.\n\nAt present, the continuous coverage of the Earth\u2019s surface is mainly achieved by\nthe GEO. But as the orbit inclination of the GEO is 0?, the coverage of high latitude\nregions and Polar Regions is unrealizable. Therefore, with regard to the coverage of\nPolar Regions, multiple low and medium-orbit satellites with a large inclination are\noften used to constitute a constellation to achieve the coverage. However, the arc of\nthe satellite when it is passing through the observation region is limited, so when\nthe number of satellites in the constellation is restricted, continuous coverage is not\nable to be achieved and the frequency of the coverage depends on the number of\n\nMatteo Ceriotti, Colin R.

Moreover, if\nthe constellation consists of imaging satellites, in order to obtain the observation\nresult with a full field of view, the reconstruction of multiple images must be done.\n\nIf the earth pole-sitter orbit is adopted, one spacecraft will be enough to achieve\nthe continuous coverage of the Polar Regions. It is not only beneficial to real-time\nreconnaissance, monitoring and communication with a full field of view, but also\nprovides weather observation data with moderate precision, instead of the tradi-\ntional periodic data, to the meteorological departments.\n\n8.2 Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit: Design Method\n\n8.2.1 Dynamic Model in Circular Restricted\nThree-Body Problem\n\nThe circular restricted three-body problem is to study the motion of an object (the\nspacecraft) with a very small mass under the universal gravitation of two large\ncelestial bodies, i.e., the circular motion around the centers of mass of the two\ncelestial bodies. This model ignores the gravitation of the spacecraft to the two large\ncelestial bodies.\n\nWe assume that the masses of the two large celestial bodies P1 and P2 are m1 and\nm2 respectively, and they move in a circular motion around each other with a\nrotational angular velocity of x. Now we define the centroid rotation coordinate\nsystem as Oxyz, which is shown in Fig. 8.1.\n\n\u2022 The origin represents the centroid of the two-body system consisting of two\nlarge celestial bodies P1 and P2;\n\n\u2022 x? y Plane represents the motion planes of P1 and P2;\n\u2022 x axis is fixed with the line connecting P1 and P2, points to the smaller celestial\n\nbody P2, and does a circular motion with it.\n\u2022 z axis is consistent with the rotation axis of the system;\n\n\u20acr\u00fe 2x? _r\u00fex? x? r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ?rV \u00fe a \u00f08:1\u00de\n\nFig. 8.1 Centroid rotation\ncoordinate system in\nrestricted three-body problem\n\n226 8 Theory and Design Method of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit\n\n\n\nHere: r is the position vector; a is the non-gravitational acceleration, such as the\nthrust; V is the gravitational potential function of the large celestial bodies, and\n\nV r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ? 1? l\nr1\n\n\u00fe l\nr2\n\n? ?\n; l \u00bc m2\n\nm1 \u00fem2 \u00f08:2\u00de\n\nThen, the gravitational constants of the two celestial bodies are:\n\nGm1 \u00bc 1? l\nGm2 \u00bc l\n\nHere: G represents the universal gravitational constant.\nWe will use a normative dimensionless form in the following equations, i.e., we\n\nassume x \u00bc 1 and the unit of distance is the distance between the two celestial\nbodies. In this way, the coordinate of m1 on X axis is ?l, that of m2 is 1? l. If the\nlarge celestial body m1 represents the Sun and m2 represents the Earth, then l \u00bc\n3:0404? 10?6 and r1; r2 are the radius vectors of the spacecraft to the two large\ncelestial bodies m1;m2, then\n\nr1 \u00bc r\u00fe 0 0 l\u00bd ?T\nr2 \u00bc r? 0 0 1? l\u00bd ?T\n\n?\n\u00f08:3\u00de\n\nIf we define U r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ? 12 x2 \u00fe y2\u00f0 \u00de, then x? x? r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc rU; and if we let\nU \u00bc V \u00feU, then Eq. (8.1) can be changed into:\n\n\u20acr\u00fe 2x? _r \u00bc ?rU\u00fe a \u00f08:4\u00de\n\nIt is already known that the spacecraft in the earth pole-sitter orbit remains on the\nrotation axis of the Earth during the whole mission. If the Earth\u2019s pole shift and\nnutation are ignored, then the rotation axis of the Earth will not go through rotation\nand other changes when the Earth revolves around the Sun. Hence, in the rotation\ncoordinate system mentioned above, the rotation axis of the Earth rotates at a\nvelocity opposite to that of the three-body system, and the rotational angular\nvelocity is ?x. In this way, after a one-year rotation, the rotation axis of the Earth\nwill form a cone as is shown in Fig. 8.2.\n\nIn order to keep the spacecraft on the rotation axis of the Earth all the time, we\nassume that at the moment when t0 \u00bc 0, the spacecraft is at the winter solstice point\nin Fig. 8.2, then the position vector of the spacecraft can be described as:\n\nr\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\nd\u00f0t\u00de sin deq cosxt\u00fe 1? l\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?d\u00f0t\u00de sin deq sinxt\nd\u00f0t\u00des cos deq\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f08:5\u00de\n\nHere: d\u00f0t\u00de represents the distance between the center of the Earth and the\nspacecraft, and is often a continuous function of time. When we substitute Eq. (8.5)\n\n8.2 Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit: Design Method 227\n\n\n\ninto Eq. (8.4), the value and the direction of the controlling acceleration required in\ncompleting the earth pole-sitter orbit control can be obtained.\n\n8.2.2 Design of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit with Fixed\nResidence Distance\n\nWe assume that the combination control by SEP/solar sail is adopted, the initial\nposition of the spacecraft is at the winter solstice point, the initial mass is 1000 kg,\nand the geocentric distance is 0.01AU. Then we use the dynamic model of the\nspacecraft in the earth pole-sitter orbit formulated in the previous section to sim-\nulate the operation of the spacecraft in one year. The simulation result is shown in\nFig. 8.3.\n\nFigure 8.3 illustrates the controlling accelerations (the illumination of the solar\nsail b0 \u00bc 0:05) needed for a one-year earth pole-sitter mission. The black bold\narrows, which are in proportion, represent the value and direction of the acceler-\nation needed to stay in the orbit; the green arrows represent the normal direction of\nthe solar sail\u2019s surface. As the solar sail adopted in the calculation is not ideal, the\ndirection is not totally consistent with the direction of the controlling force (the blue\narrows) produced in practice by the solar sail; the black arrows represent the\nacceleration provided by the solar electric propulsion.\n\nFrom Fig. 8.3, it can be seen that on the whole, the gravitational accelerations\npoint to the ?z? axis, so the thrust imposed has to be in the opposite direction;\nthe direction of the accelerations provided by the solar sail has a component in the\ndirection of the \u00fez? axis, and obviously, it has a component in the direction of the\n\u00fex? axis (i.e., the direction of the line connecting the Sun and the spacecraft).\nTherefore, the direction of the accelerations provided by SEP mainly supplements\nthe acceleration in the direction of the \u00fez? axis, and offsets the remaining com-\nponents in the direction of y?.\n\nFig. 8.2 Motion of Earth\u2019s\nrotation axis in three-body\nsystem\n\n228 8 Theory and Design Method of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4 illustrates the value of the acceleration (the dotted line) provided by\nthe solar sail and SEP. In the figure, the line with circles represents the value of the\nacceleration needed to complete the earth pole-sitter mission; b0 \u00bc 0 indicates that\nthe acceleration provided by the solar sail is 0 and there is only SEP to provide the\ncontrolling acceleration; the green line represents the controlling acceleration pro-\nvided by the solar sail and SEP when b0 \u00bc 0:05; the red line represents the con-\ntrolling acceleration provided by the solar sail and SEP when b0 \u00bc 0:1.\n\nFrom Fig. 8.4, it can be seen that the controlling acceleration needed from SEP\naround summer solstice (t 2 100; 250\u00bd ?) is relatively big.\n\nFigure 8.5 illustrates the changes in the mass of the spacecraft, mainly the\nconsumption of propellant during the propulsion control by SEP.\n\nFigure 8.6 illustrates the influence of the residence distance of the spacecraft (the\ndistance between the spacecraft and the earth center) on propellant consumption.\nFrom Fig. 8.6, it can be seen that as the residence distance becomes shorter, the\ngravitation of the Earth starts to take the leading role and fuel consumption\n\nFig. 8.3 Controlling\nacceleration needed for\none-year earth pole-sitter\nmission\n\nFig. 8.4 Thrust acceleration\nprovided by SEP and solar\nsail\n\n8.2 Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit: Design Method 229\n\n\n\nincreases sharply. And when the geocentric distance d ffi 0:017AU, the consump-\ntion of propellant reaches the lowest point.\n\n8.2.3 Design of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit with Unfixed\nResidence Distance\n\nIf there are fewer constraints on the residence distance and an inclined orbit is\nadopted, the solar sail might be better utilized and thus we can decrease propellant\nconsumption and extend residence time.\n\nWe assume the residence geocentric distance of the spacecraft at the winter\nsolstice point is d1 and that at the summer solstice point is d2, the changes in\nresidence height in one year is shown in Fig. 8.7.\n\nFig. 8.5 Changes in\nspacecraft\u2019s mass\n\nFig. 8.6 Residence distance\nand propellant consumption\n\n230 8 Theory and Design Method of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit\n\n\n\nWith regard to the residence method mentioned above, the following equations\ncan be obtained:\n\nd\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc d1 \u00fe d2 ? d1\u00f0 \u00de cos xt\u00fe p\u00f0 \u00de\u00fe 12 \u00f08:6\u00de\n\nr\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\nd\u00f0t\u00de sin de cosxt\u00fe 1? l\u00f0 \u00de\n\n?d\u00f0t\u00de sin de sinxt\nd\u00f0t\u00des cos de\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f08:7\u00de\n\nWe assume d1 \u00bc 0:01AU, d2 \u00bc 0:015AU. Through simulation, the controlling\nacceleration (b0 \u00bc 0:05) needed for a one-year earth pole-sitter mission can be\nobtained as Fig. 8.8 shows.\n\nThe accelerations provided by the solar sail and SEP respectively in one year are\nshown in Fig. 8.9. In the figure, the dotted line represents the acceleration provided\n\nFig. 8.7 Changes in\nresidence position\n\nFig. 8.8 Controlling\nacceleration needed for\none-year residence (with\nchanging residence heights)\n\n8.2 Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit: Design Method 231\n\n\n\nby SEP and the line with circles represents the total controlling acceleration needed\nin completing the earth pole-sitter mission.\n\nIt can be seen that the controlling acceleration needed from SEP decreases\nsubstantially around summer solstice and this can save the propellant remarkably.\n\nFigure 8.10 illustrates the changes in the spacecraft\u2019s mass along with time.\nCompared with the situation when the residence height is unchanged, the propellant\nis quite obviously saved.\n\nIt is worth noting that the saving in propellant is not because the residence height\nbecomes higher during the summer only. The more important fact is that inclined\nresidence is adopted. Generally, with regard to the north pole-sitter mission,\nkeeping shorter residence distance in winter and longer residence distance in\nsummer will save more propellant.\n\nFig. 8.9 Thrust acceleration\nprovided by SEP and solar\nsail (with changing residence\nheights)\n\nFig. 8.10 Changes in\nspacecraft\u2019s mass (with\nchanging residence heights)\n\n232 8 Theory and Design Method of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit\n\n\n\n8.3 Optimization Design of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit\n\nIt can be known from the above analysis that, by means of designing the residence\ndistance of the spacecraft, the propellant needed in the control of the earth\npole-sitter spacecraft can be saved effectively. In practical application, we should,\non the basis of the specific requirement of the payload on the spacecraft, choose\nbetween the fixed residence height and the changing residence height. If the\nrequirement of the payload is not considered, then an optimal change law of the\nspacecraft\u2019s residence distance can be found through optimization in order to save\nthe propellant as much as possible.\n\nWe take b0 \u00bc 0; 0:05; 0:1 and dmax \u00bc 0:1AU, and pick 60 sampling points in\none year to optimize them. The variation in the geocentric distance of the spacecraft\nwhen energy is saved most is shown in Fig. 8.11.\n\nFigure 8.12 illustrates the variation of the spacecraft\u2019s geocentric distance under\nthree conditions, i.e., b0 \u00bc 0; 0:05; 0:1. Under the first condition, the spacecraft is\n\nFig. 8.11 Optimal paths\nwhen b0 \u00bc 0; 0:05; 0:1\n\nFig. 8.12 Variation of the\nspacecraft\u2019s geocentric\ndistance\n\n8.3 Optimization Design of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit 233\n\n\n\nsolely propelled by SEP (i.e., b0 \u00bc 0), the optimal path is symmetric in summer and\nwinter, and as b0 increases, the residence orbit becomes closer to the geo-center in\nwinter and becomes farther from the geo-center in summer; when b0 \u00bc 0:1, the\ndistance in summer is two times of that in winter.\n\nFigures 8.13 and 8.14 illustrate the controlling acceleration needed from the\nsolar sail and SEP with the optimal path and the variation in the spacecraft\u2019s mass\nrespectively.\n\nFrom Fig. 8.13, it can be known that under the sole control of SEP (i.e., b0 \u00bc 0),\nthe controlling acceleration includes two regions: one passes the summer solstice\npoint and one passes the winter solstice point. In the two regions, the controlling\nacceleration provided by SEP is almost constant. The two regions are divided by\ntwo narrow V shapes at the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox. In the two\nV-shaped regions, the controlling acceleration needed from SEP becomes very\nsmall, the motion of the spacecraft along the direction of the z? axis will reverse, i.e.,\nthe minimum controlling acceleration appears when the spacecraft is farthest from\nthe geo-center.\n\nIf b0 \u00bc 0:05, less acceleration provided by SEP will be needed in the V-shaped\nregions. Meanwhile, the thrust region around the summer solstice point becomes\nsmaller and the two regions with weaker thrust become larger.\n\nIf b0 \u00bc 0:1, the thrust region around the summer solstice point disappears, the\ntwo ballistic arcs merge, i.e., from spring all the way to autumn.\n\nFrom Fig. 8.14, it can be known that adopting the solar sail can reduce the\nconsumption and loss of propellant effectively. We can take one year as a period,\nand it can be seen that the control solely by SEP consumes 158 kg of propellant.\nBut if a solar sail of b0 \u00bc 0:05 is adopted, the propellant consumption is reduced to\n97 kg.\n\nTable 8.1 provides the parameter comparison of the three optimal paths when\nb0 \u00bc 0; 0:05; 0:1.\n\nHere, Tmax is the maximum control force provided by SEP.\n\nFig. 8.13 Controlling\nacceleration provided by solar\nsail and SEP with optimal\npath\n\n234 8 Theory and Design Method of Earth Pole-Sitter Orbit\n\n\n\n8.4 Summary\n\nThe geostationary orbit (GEO) is not able to achieve the coverage of high latitude\nregions and Polar Regions. So generally, in order to achieve the continuous cov-\nerage of these regions, multiple spacecraft should be used to form a constellation\nand the number of the spacecraft has to be large. The earth pole-sitter orbit uses\norbit control to achieve the long-term residence of the spacecraft at the Earth\u2019s\npoles. Therefore, with only one spacecraft, the coverage of the high latitude regions\nin the northern or southern hemisphere (including the North Pole or the South Pole)\ncan be achieved. This has significant application values in navigation, communi-\ncation, meteorological reconnaissance, and other areas.\n\nOf course, from the above analysis, it can be seen that the defects of this orbit are\nalso quite obvious. As the orbit is very far from the Earth\u2019s surface, it is difficult for\nit to be used in reconnaissance that has a high demand for precision and in other\nfields.\n\nFig. 8.14 Variation of\nspacecraft\u2019s mass with\noptimal path\n\nTable 8.1 Parameter comparison of three optimal paths when b0 \u00bc 0; 0:05; 0:1\nb0 mint\n\nd\u00f0t\u00de; AU max\nt\n\nd\u00f0t\u00de; AU mf ; kg mprop =m0 Tmax; N\n0.0 0.015675 0.020332 843.430417 0.156570 0.180648\n\n0.05 0.013116 0.023422 901.896219 0.098104 0.141085\n\n0.1 0.011896 0.028363 925.192867 0.074807 0.134256\n\n8.4 Summary 235\n\n\n\nAppendix A\nOptimization Design of Rendezvous Orbit\nwith MATLAB\n\nWe assume that there are n target spacecraft whose orbits are all circular orbits,\nwhich means they will form 2n traversing points in the rendezvous orbit plane.\nAccording to the determination method of traversing points, the positions of the 2n\ntraversing points can be expressed as:\n\n\u00f0r1;/1\u00de; \u00f0r1;/1 \u00fe p\u00de; \u00f0r2;/2\u00de; \u00f0r2;/2 \u00fe p\u00de; . . .; \u00f0rn;/n\u00de; \u00f0rn;/n \u00fe p\u00de\n\nAnd the positions are shown in Fig. A.1.\nFig. A.1 illustrates four pairs of traversing points, i.e., eight traversing points\n\nformed when the four orbits of the target spacecraft passing through the rendezvous\norbit plane, and they are \u00f0A1;A10\u00de, \u00f0A2;A20\u00de, \u00f0A3;A30\u00de, \u00f0A4;A40\u00de respectively. The\nphase angles of these points relative to the direction of the ascending node of the\nrendezvous orbit are \u00f0/1;/1 \u00fe p\u00de, \u00f0/2;/2 \u00fe p\u00de, \u00f0/3;/3 \u00fe p\u00de, \u00f0/4;/4 \u00fe p\u00de\nrespectively. Obviously, through curve fitting, an elliptical curve can be fitted and it\nis realizable to require one of the focuses on the elliptical curve to be at the\nspherical center of the Earth. The relation between the direction of the perigee and\nthe direction of the ascending node is shown in Fig. A.2.\n\nIf the orbit plane of the rendezvous orbit is determined, which means the two\norbit elements of the rendezvous orbit, i.e., the orbit inclination i and the right\nascension of the ascending node X, are already known. Then, the remaining orbit\nelements needed to be determined are the size, the shape and the direction of the\nrendezvous orbit in the orbit plane, i.e., the semi-major axis a, the eccentricity e and\nthe argument of perigee x.\n\nAccording to Kepler\u2019s First Law, it can be known that the rendezvous orbit is an\nelliptical curve and the Earth is at one of the focuses of the ellipse. We define a\ntwo-dimensional reference coordinate system o? xy and a two-dimensional\ntranslational coordinate system o0 ? x0y0 in the rendezvous orbit plane. Here, ox\npoints to the direction of the ascending node. And then, we define another coor-\ndinate system o0 ? x00y00 along the rendezvous orbit, with o0 ? x00 pointing to the\ndirection of the perigee of the rendezvous orbit. This is shown in Fig. A.3.\n\n\u00a9 National Defense Industry Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017\nY. Zhang et al., Theory and Design Methods of Special Space Orbits,\nDOI 10.1007/978-981-10-2948-6\n\n237\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that the included angle w between the ox axis and the o0x00 axis is\nthe argument of perigee x of the elliptical orbit. When we assume the semi-major\naxis of the ellipse is a, the semi-minor axis is b, and the coordinates of the ellipse\u2019s\ncenter in o? xy are \u00f0xc0; yc0\u00de, then the following equation can be obtained:\n\na2 ? b2 \u00bc c2 \u00bc x2c0 \u00fe y2c0 \u00f0A:1\u00de\n\nIt is already known that in the o0 ? x00y00 coordinate system, the rendezvous orbit\ncan be described by the following elliptic equation:\n\nFig. A.1 Distribution of traversing points in rendezvous orbit plane\n\nFig. A.2 Schematic figure of parameters of rendezvous orbit\n\n238 Appendix A: Optimization Design of Rendezvous Orbit with MATLAB\n\n\n\nx00\n\na2\n\u00fe y\n\n00\n\nb2\n\u00bc 1 \u00f0A:2\u00de\n\nNow we convert Eq.

(A.4), it can be found that the\nA;B;C;D;E in Eq. (A.6) are only related to three parameters (b; xc0; yc0).\n\nBased on different mission requirements and the distribution of traversing points,\nvarious rendezvous orbits can be designed. In this section, we take the minimum\nsum of total distances between every traversing point and the rendezvous orbit as\nthe optimization index to design an optimal rendezvous orbit. The design method is\nas follows.\n\nWe assume that there is a group of given traversing points \u00f0x1; y1\u00de. . .\u00f0xn; yn\u00de, and\nrecord the minimum distance between the i-th traversing point and the rendezvous\norbit as Li, then the question can be described as.\n\nFind a rendezvous orbit, i.e., find a group of A;B;C;D;E where min\nPn\n\ni\u00bc1 Li. As\nA, B, C, D, E are the functions of parameters b; xc0; yc0\u00f0 \u00de, the question is now\ntransformed into looking for a group of parameters b; xc0; yc0\u00f0 \u00de where min\n\nPn\ni\u00bc1 Li.\n\nIn other words, the optimization design of a rendezvous orbit is the optimization\ndesign of multiple parameters under constraint conditions.\n\nHere we take the four low-orbit satellites as an example and try to find a\nrendezvous orbit by which fast approaching detection can be achieved according to\nthe above design method. The orbit parameters of the four target satellites are\nshown in Table A.1.\n\nWe assume the orbit inclination of the rendezvous orbit plane is 45\u00b0 and the right\nascension of the ascending node is 100\u00b0, then the traversing points of the four target\nsatellites formed in the rendezvous orbit plane are shown in Table A.2.\n\nTable A.1 Orbit parameters of four target satellites\n\nSerial\nnumber\n\nOrbit\naltitude (km)\n\nOrbit\ninclination\n\nRight ascension of ascending\nnode\n\n1 715 57\u00b0 30\u00b0\n\n2 800 63\u00b0 40\u00b0\n\n3 850 99\u00b0 60\u00b0\n\n4 1100 63\u00b0 70\u00b0\n\n240 Appendix A: Optimization Design of Rendezvous Orbit with MATLAB\n\n\n\nNow we use the optimization toolbox in MATLAB and take the minimum sum\nof total distances between the traversing points and the rendezvous orbit as the\noptimization index to design the orbit parameters of the rendezvous orbit in the\norbit plane. The orbit parameters are shown in Table A.3.\n\nIf we convert the parameters into orbit elements and combine them with the\nparameters of the rendezvous orbit plane, then the orbit parameters of the ren-\ndezvous orbit are shown in Table A.4.\n\nTable A.2 Coordinates of traversing points in rendezvous orbit plane\n\nTraversing\npoint 1\n\nTraversing\npoint 2\n\nTraversing\npoint 3\n\nTraversing\npoint 4\n\nGeocentric distance r (km) 7093.1 7178.1 7228.1 7478.1\n\nArgument of ascending\nnode / (deg)\n\n76.976 89.554 315.481 296.756\n\nTraversing\npoint 5\n\nTraversing\npoint 6\n\nTraversing\npoint 7\n\nTraversing\npoint 8\n\nGeocentric distance\nr (km)\n\n7093.1 7178.1 7228.1 7478.1\n\nArgument of ascending\nnode / (deg)\n\n25.6.976 26.9.554 135.481 116.756\n\nTable A.4 Orbit elements of rendezvous orbit\n\nOrbit\ninclination i\n\nRight ascension of\nascending node X\n\nArgument of\nperigee x\n\nSemi-major\naxis a\n\nEccentricity\ne\n\n45 deg 100 deg 327.898 deg 7209.903 km 0.00249\n\nTable A.3 Parameters of rendezvous orbit in orbit plane\n\nSemi-major axis a Semi-minor axis b x_c0 y_c0 Argument of perigee x\n\n7209.903 km 7209.88 km 15.18 km ?9.63 km 327.898 deg\n\nAppendix A: Optimization Design of Rendezvous Orbit with MATLAB 241\n\n\n\nThe distribution of the eight traversing points in the rendezvous orbit plane and\nthe optimal rendezvous orbit designed are shown in Fig. A.4.\n\nThe rectangular coordinates of the eight traversing points in the rendezvous orbit\nplane and their minimum distances to the rendezvous orbit are shown in Table A.5.\n\nFig. A.4 Schematic figure of traversing points and rendezvous orbit\n\nTable A.5 Minimum distances between traversing points and rendezvous orbits\n\nSerial\nnumber\n\nTraversing point Coordinates of traversing point (km) Minimum\ndistance (km)\n\n1 Traversing point 1 (1598.5, 6910.6) 110.8348\n\n2 Traversing point 2 (5587.5, 7177.9) 22.24078\n\n3 Traversing point 3 (5153.8, ?5068.0) 0.6784\n\n4 Traversing point 4 (3366.6, ?6677.4) 252.752\n\n5 Traversing point 5 (?1598.5, ?6910.6) 122.7575\n\n6 Traversing point 6 (?5587.5, ?7177.9) 41.2657\n\n7 Traversing point 7 (?5153.8, 5068.0) 35.8368\n\n8 Traversing point 8 (?3366.6, 667.74) 283.6231\n\nLayout: T1_Standard Book ID: 370757_1_En Book ISBN: 978-981-10-2947-9\n\nChapter No.: BM 2 Date: 20-11-2016 Time: 1:58 pm Page: 242/243\n\n242 Appendix A: Optimization Design of Rendezvous Orbit with MATLAB\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nClassification of Geosynchronous objects, issue 15.
