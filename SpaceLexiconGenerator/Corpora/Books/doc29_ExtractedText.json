It is still the most compre-\nhensive book on that subject. While later editions do cover some spacecraft hardware \ndesign issues, the book\u2019s main emphasis is on the analysis and design of space mis-\nsions, rather than the design of spacecraft hardware itself.\n\nSince 1991, interest in LEO spacecraft has increased tremendously, as has the \nnumber of young workers in the field. With the advent of CubeSats, the number of \nsatellites being built and launched today has skyrocketed.\n\nThis book, Low Earth Orbiting Satellite Design, is intended to complement \nSpace Mission Analysis and Design. It focuses on the design of the spacecraft hard-\nware and software, and it intends to provide the new crop of space enthusiasts with \nthe tools they need to design hardware and software for space. At the end of the \nbook, a spacecraft design problem is given. The reader is encouraged to complete \nthe design posed by the problem with the spreadsheets and equations provided in \nthe book, thereby affirming all that has been learned over the course of this text.\n\nMcLean, VA, USA George\u00a0Sebestyen\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nvii\n\nContents\n\n 1  The Space Environment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1\n 1.1   The Environment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1\n\n 1.1.1   The Earth Magnetic Field  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1\n 1.1.2   Solar Energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   3\n 1.1.3   Residual Atmosphere . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   3\n 1.1.4   Gravity and\u00a0Gravity Gradient  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   5\n\n 1.2   The Earth and\u00a0Spacecraft Coordinate System . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   5\n 1.3   Other Space Environmental Matters  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   7\n\n 2  Satellite Missions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   9\n 2.1   Satellite Orbits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   9\n 2.2   Satellites Today  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  10\n 2.3   Satellite Imaging  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  13\n\n 2.3.1   Imaging Payload Fundamentals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  15\n 2.3.2   The Telescope  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  16\n 2.3.3   Image Quality. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  18\n 2.3.4   Adequacy of\u00a0the\u00a0Light Input  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  19\n 2.3.5   Image Integration (Exposure) Time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  21\n 2.3.6   Pointing to\u00a0a\u00a0Target on\u00a0the\u00a0Ground . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  23\n 2.3.7   Swath Width . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  26\n 2.3.8   Spacecraft Agility and\u00a0Targeting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  28\n 2.3.9   Imaging Spacecraft Attitude Sensing,  \n\nControl Requirements  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  28\n 2.3.10   Data Quantity and\u00a0Downlink Data Rate  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  29\n 2.3.11   An Imaging Scenario . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  30\n\n 2.4   Satellite Constellations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  31\n 2.4.1   Present Constellations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  31\n 2.4.2   Coverage and\u00a0Gaps  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  33\n 2.4.3   Other Satellite Constellation Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . .  37\n\n\n\nviii\n\n 3  Orbits and\u00a0Spacecraft-Related Geometry  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   39\n 3.1   Acceleration of\u00a0Gravity, Velocity, Period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  39\n 3.2   Position of\u00a0Spacecraft as\u00a0a\u00a0Function of\u00a0Time  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  40\n 3.3   Spacecraft Elevation, Slant Range, CPA, Ground Range  . . . . . . . .  42\n 3.4   Pointing to\u00a0a\u00a0Target on\u00a0the\u00a0Ground From\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft. . . . . . . . .  47\n 3.5   Ballistic Coefficient and\u00a0On-Orbit Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  49\n 3.6   Computing the\u00a0Projection of\u00a0the\u00a0Sun on\u00a0Planes  \n\non\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  51\n\n 4  Electric Power Subsystem Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   55\n 4.1   Required Orbit Average Power (OAP) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  56\n 4.2   Battery Capacity and\u00a0Battery System Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  57\n\n 4.2.1   Battery Capacity. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  57\n 4.2.2   Battery Choice . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  59\n\n 4.3   Solar Arrays Configuration  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  60\n 4.4   Beta Angle Vs.

degree in Mechanical Engineering. \nHe worked in spacecraft thermal analysis and design during his entire career, first at \nRCA/GE/Martin Marietta and later at Swales and Orbital-ATK.\u00a0After becoming an \nindependent contractor, he went on to work on many spacecraft at Ford Aerospace, \nFairchild, Lockheed Martin, and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. He \nworked on the thermal design of the GOES-R series, Quik TOMS, Indostar, CGS \nWind and Polar, GPS-2R, TOPEX, GOES-1 series, Satcom-Ku, and several other \nspacecraft. He is a contributing author of the Aerospace Corporation Spacecraft \nThermal Control Handbook. He imparts to the reader an understanding of the design \ndrivers, the bounding thermal cases, and the way these influence spacecraft design.\n\nSteve\u00a0Fujikawa received a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering \nfrom Stanford University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical and \nAerospace Engineering from Cornell University. His expertise is in spacecraft \nAttitude Determination and Control Systems, and he has contributed to their devel-\nopment at many large aerospace primes and most agencies of the Federal \nGovernment, including NASA and the DOD.\n\nMr. Fujikawa is the Founder and President of Maryland Aerospace, Inc., which \nmanufactures CubeSats, SmallSats, subsystems, and components, including inte-\ngrated ADACS systems for cost-sensitive applications.\n\nNicholas\u00a0 Galassi received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical \nEngineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He spent the first decade of his \ncareer performing structural analysis of military aircraft such as the F/A-18 and \nA-6F attack fighters and AV8B Harrier jump jet. He has spent the last three decades \nperforming analysis of space structures. His experience includes managing engi-\nneering groups and providing analysis support to over 18 space programs.\n\nMr. Galassi founded his own analysis consulting company, which has supported \nNASA, DOD, and private spacecraft programs. His support on this book provides \nguidance to the engineer in analyzing spacecraft and instrument and component \nstructures for a typical spacecraft mission.\n\n\n\nxvi\n\nGeorge\u00a0Sebestyen received his Doctor of Science degree in Electronics from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He has done research in radar, digital com-\nputer technology, speech bandwidth compression, signal processing, and the auto-\nmation of video image analysis. He managed the research activities of a division of \nE-Systems and later of Litton Industries. After a stint in the Office of the Secretary \nof Defense, where he was an Assistant Director for Tactical Warfare for the Director \nof Defense Research and Engineering, he returned to industry.\n\nHe was first Vice President of Systems Engineering at Sanders Associates (now \nBAE), then General Manager of the radar and ordnance division of the company, \nand later Group Vice President of the Federal Systems Group. This Group consisted \nof six divisions with a very broad range of products in most aspects of electronics. \nThe Group developed and manufactured (1) Air Force and Navy ECM equipment \nfor aircraft; (2) Sonobuoys and ASW signal processors, displays, and oceanographic \nbuoys; (3) Army air search radars; (4) IR countermeasures for aircraft and helicop-\nters; (5) communication intercept and DF systems for aircraft, ships, and subma-\nrines; and (6) command and control systems.\n\nSebestyen went on to become Vice President of the Engineering Division of the \nBoeing Aerospace Company. This 8200-people division and its test facilities provided \nengineering for strategic and tactical missiles and airborne early warning aircraft. \nThe division was also responsible for a number of large spacecraft programs.\n\nSebestyen then started his own company, Defense Systems, Inc., which built sur-\nveillance systems and spacecraft. The company, now part of Orbital-ATK, built 34 \ndifferent spacecraft in the range of 50\u20133300 lbs.\n\nThis book is based on his experiences and is intended to help spacecraft hardware \ndesigners and builders.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\n\n\nxvii\n\nBook Overview\n\nThis book is intended for the practical, hands-on spacecraft designer community. It \ndoes not provide a comprehensive treatment of the Earth environment, \nAstrodynamics or Spacecraft Mission Design. Only what is necessary for space-\ncraft hardware design is covered. The book assumes that the spacecraft mission has \nalready been defined and specified. In the last chapter, a sample problem is given \nfor the reader to solve.\n\nChapter 1 Space Environment describes the magnetic field, acceleration of gravity \nand solar and Albedo radiation. These are quantified so that the satellite designer \ncan use these in developing the electric power and attitude control and propulsion \nsystems, and also calculate atmospheric drag forces and tipoff torques that the \nADACS and propulsion systems must overcome.\n\nChapter 2 Satellite Missions describes various types of orbits, satellites and the \ngrowth of the number of small LEO satellites. This chapter also contains a detailed \ndescription of an imaging satellite and imaging satellite design. Design equations \nand graphs are provided. The chapter ends with a discussion of satellite constella-\ntions, ways of deploying the individual satellites to their stations and station \nkeeping.\n\nChapter 3 Orbits and Spacecraft-Related Geometry begins by defining the space-\ncraft orbital elements, obtaining the satellite ground track, ground station access \ntimes and elevation angles during each pass. It covers the most often used geometri-\ncal relationships, orbit period, pass durations for various minimum elevation angles, \nhow a ground station off the spacecraft ground track would see the spacecraft and \nhow pass durations and peak elevation angles would be affected by the ground sta-\ntion Closest Point of Approach (CPA) to the ground trace.\n\nChapter 4 Electric Power Subsystem Design details the procedure for obtaining the \nrequired Orbit Average Power (OAP) and Battery Capacity. It discusses how to \nobtain the instantaneous and orbit average power generated by a set of solar panels, \nthen ends with a block diagram of an electric power subsystem.\n\n\n\nxviii\n\nChapter 5 Spacecraft Communications discusses frequency allocations for space-\ncraft, modulation types and Forward Error Correction. It presents the Eb/No required \nfor different Bit Error Rates and Modulation Types. It develops the RF link equa-\ntions as a function of elevation angle for a typical spacecraft antenna and a large \ndish ground station. Various antennas and their gain patterns are described.

It varies inversely with \nthe cube of the radius from the center of the Earth, and it also varies with the mag-\nnetic latitude. A simplified dipole model of the scalar magnetic field (MF) in nano-\nTesla is in Eq. (1.1); and the picture of the magnetic field around the Earth and its \nvariations with altitude, H, magnetic latitude, ?, are shown in Fig.\u00a01.1a, b. R is the \nradius of the Earth. An accurate model of the field is given in Appendix H of \nReference 71, based on the International Geomagnetic Field Model, from which the \nfield can be computed as a function of altitude, Latitude, Longitude and time.\n\n \nMF nT R R H 1 3\n\n3 2 0 5( ) = +( )( ) + ( )( )?? ??\n? ? ?30,000 / sin\n\n.\n\n?\n \n\n(1.1)\n\n\n\n2\n\nFig. 1.1 (a) The earth magnetic field. (b) The earth magnetic field vs. altitude  \nand magnetic latitude\n\n1 The Space Environment\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field at midlatitudes is nearly parallel to the surface \nof the Earth, as seen from the picture of Fig.\u00a01.1a. It \u201csucks in\u201d towards the Poles. \nThe property that the field is nearly parallel to the Earth at midlatitudes is used by \nsome CubeSat spacecraft to align one dimension of the spacecraft with the local \nhorizon. The spacecraft includes a horizontal magnet. At midlatitudes, the magnet \naligns itself with the magnetic lines and provides a degree of stabilization to the \nspacecraft. When the spacecraft approaches the Polar region, it tends to first \u201csuck \nin\u201d then flip.\n\nThe magnetic field of Earth varies with time. Models representing the field are \nupdated every 7 years. To illustrate the variation of the magnetic field, consider the \nmotion of the Poles. In 2015, the magnetic North Pole was located at 86.27\u00b0 N and \n159.18\u00b0 W.\u00a0The South Pole was at 62.26\u00b0 S and 136.59\u00b0 E.\u00a0The North Pole was \ndrifting North at about 40\u00a0miles per year. It was also getting weaker.\n\n1.1.2  Solar Energy\n\nThe heat sources seen by a spacecraft are direct radiation by the sun, Earth-reflected \nradiation of the Sun (Albedo) and outgoing long wave Earth radiation. The sun \nincident power varies between 1322 and 1414\u00a0W/m2, with a median of 1367\u00a0W/m2.\n\nThe Earth-reflected power (Albedo) and Long Wave outgoing radiation from \nEarth vary with altitude and position around the Earth. Albedo radiation is mostly \nin the visible range and has a mean reflectance of 0.3, meaning that 0.3 times the \nincident sun energy is reflected from Earth omnidirectionally. The reflection coef-\nficient is less 0.25 near the Equator and about 0.7 toward the Poles.\n\nThe challenge faced by most spacecraft designs is how to get rid of the large \namount of incident heat.\n\n1.1.3  Residual Atmosphere\n\nAtmospheric density is a function of altitude and solar sunspot activity. Figure\u00a01.2 \nshows the atmospheric density as a function of altitude for High, Low and Medium \nsun spot numbers.\n\n1.1 The Environment\n\n\n\n4\n\nFig. 1.3 Sunspot activities (NASA)\n\nFig. 1.2 Atmospheric density varies with altitude & sun spot activity\n\nAtmospheric density at any given altitude varies significantly, depending on sun-\nspot activities. Sunspot activity follows a seven-year cycle and is shown in Fig.\u00a01.3. \nThe red line is a projection.\n\nAt low orbit altitudes (below ? 650\u00a0km), atmospheric density results in signifi-\ncant drag on a spacecraft, causing it to lose altitude. Atmospheric drag can also \ninduce torques if the spacecraft Center of Gravity (CG) and its Center of Pressure \n\n1 The Space Environment\n\n\n\n5\n\n(CP) are not near each other. Since sunspot activity has a major impact on atmo-\nspheric density at low altitudes, it is important to take it into consideration over the \nmission life of the spacecraft.\n\n1.1.4  Gravity and\u00a0Gravity Gradient\n\nThe acceleration of gravity at Earth\u2019s surface is 9.806\u00a0m/s2, and it varies inversely \nwith the square of the altitude. This functional relationship is shown in Eq. (1.2), \nwhere G(H) in m/s2 is the acceleration of gravity at altitude H.\u00a0The gradient of the \nacceleration of gravity is an important quantity, as it determines how well spacecraft \nwith gravity gradient booms will function. These spacecraft utilize the gravity gra-\ndient to create a restoring force for a pendulum formed by the spacecraft mass, the \ngravity gradient boom and the tip mass. This subject will be covered in more detail \nin the ADACS chapter. More detailed descriptions of the Space Environment are in \nreferences 3, 36 and 72.\n\n G H H H\n2( ) = +( )?? ???9.806 6378.14 6378.14/ , is Altitude in km  (1.2)\n\n1.2  The Earth and\u00a0Spacecraft Coordinate System\n\nThe position of a spacecraft in orbit at any instant is defined by the six Keplerian \norbital parameters, given below.

Optical \ninstruments on spacecraft need to take this into account to assure they do not point \nto the Sun or Moon unintentionally.\n\nThe angular positions of stars are maintained in a Star Catalog by the Goddard \nSpace Flight Center (GFSC). This catalog is matched against the star field seen by \na Star Tracker on a spacecraft to establish the spacecraft position and attitude.\n\n1.3 Other Space Environmental Matters\n\n\n\n9\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_2\n\nChapter 2\nSatellite Missions\n\n2.1  Satellite Orbits\n\nThe most frequent orbits are shown in Fig.\u00a02.1. Polar orbits are those where the \nplane of the orbit passes through the poles. They have inclinations of 90\u00b0 and are \nusually circular. Because the Earth rotates under the orbit, these satellites can survey \nthe entire Earth.\n\nBeta angle is the angle between the Sun line and the orbit plane. In a Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 \nPolar orbit, the Sun will see the orbit edge on. For Beta\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0 (top left figure), the \nSun will see the orbit at normal incidence. Figure\u00a02.1 also shows a Polar orbit at \nBeta\u00a0=\u00a045\u00b0 and a 60\u00b0 inclination orbit, used when mid- latitude coverage is required. \nIn the top three figures, a nadir pointing four-sided spacecraft is also shown.\n\nSun Synchronous orbits are near Polar orbits inclined so that the spacecraft sees \nthe same points on Earth at the same time each day. For example, a 97.8\u00b0 inclined \norbit at 540\u00a0km will describe exactly 15 orbits per day, and each day the spacecraft \nwill cover every point on Earth at the same time. Such orbits are very useful for \nimaging, as the orbit will ensure that the spacecraft will be over a specified area of \nthe Earth during (say) mid-morning hours.\n\nElliptical orbits that dip low at Perigee are often used by spacecraft that must be \nat low altitudes over designated areas of the Earth, but could not survive long at the \nlow altitude. For this reason their orbit is elliptical, so that they would spend a lot of \ntime at higher altitude, thereby reducing average drag and maximizing surveillance \ntime. A special case of the elliptical orbit is the Molnya orbit, which is highly ellipti-\ncal. It has an Apogee of 40,000\u00a0km, and its orbital period is 12\u00a0h. A spacecraft in this \norbit can survey the Northern hemisphere for half a day at a time.\n\nThe GPS satellite orbit is at an altitude of 20,180\u00a0km at an inclination of 55\u00b0. The \n32 spacecraft provide continuous worldwide coverage for navigation systems.\n\nWhile this book does not address Geostationary Satellites, circular orbits at \n35,786\u00a0km have 24-h orbit periods, so the satellite appears to hang over a single point \non Earth. Such orbits are used for commercial radio and television broadcasts.\n\n\n\n10\n\n2.2  Satellites Today\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, there were about 1100 active satellites in orbit in 2015, and \nabout 2600 that no longer work. More than 50 countries have spacecraft programs \nof one sort or another. In 2015, a total of 86 spacecraft were launched, 32 of which \nwere GEO and 44 that were LEO.\u00a0Additionally, 33 Cubesats were launched in 2014. \nThis number is not included in the previously mentioned satellites launched or on \norbit. So far, some 300 CubeSats have been launched, and there are another 150 or \nso in the pipeline.\n\nThe GEO satellite missions are mostly for communications or television. \nThere are some MEO satellites (GPS) that provide navigational capabilities to \nits users. Almost all of the rest are LEO satellites. Their missions range from \nweather, science, communications, Earth observation and imaging. The number \nof small LEO satellites is increasing dramatically. It is expected that in the \nperiod from 2014 to 2023 an average of 115 small LEO satellites will be \nlaunched per year.\n\nSome representative LEO satellites are illustrated in the following figures:\n\nFig. 2.1 Polar, inclined, sun-synchronous and elliptical orbits seen from the sun\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n11\n\nThe satellite in Fig.\u00a02.2 has an explosive bolt separation system. Figure\u00a02.3 shows \nhorizontal mating of the satellites with the launch vehicle. Two satellites are \nlaunched, one on top of the other.\n\nThe spacecraft below illustrate the great variety of LEO spacecraft, orbits, meth-\nods of stabilization, types of propulsion systems and methods of deploying a variety \nof solar arrays and antennas (Figs.\u00a02.4 \u2013 2.7).\n\nFig. 2.2 180 lbs, 89.5\u00b0, 756\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0887\u00a0km orbit, gravity gradient stabilized communications satellite\n\nFig. 2.3 Two 170-lbs polar orbit digital store-forward communications satellites\n\n2.2  Satellites Today\n\n\n\nFig. 2.4 190 Ibs Polar orbit, 800 km altitude radar calibration satellite  \nwith 17 deployable antennas\n\nFig. 2.5 400 Ibs, 822 km Polar orbit, 3-axis pitch bias momentum stabilized satellite.  \nGimbaled dish antenna & deployable solar panels\n\nFig. 2.6 900 lbs, 548\u00a0km, 40\u00b0 Orbit satellite with hydrazine propulsion, 3-axis stabilized,  \n3 reaction wheels, deployable solar panels with solar array drive\n\n\n\n13\n\nFig. 2.7 579 lbs, 430\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01375\u00a0km, 68.9\u00b0 Orbit 3-axis stabilized satellite with 3 reaction  \nwheels, hydrazine propulsion, deployable solar panels\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\nImaging spacecraft are used for remote sensing and for taking images or strip photo-\ngraphs of points on Earth. Remote sensing satellites are typically in Polar or near- Polar \norbits to cover the entire Earth. Often, near-Polar orbits are also sun synchronous so that \nany given point on Earth is covered at the same time each day. Figure\u00a02.8 illustrates such \nan orbit and several imaging spacecraft.\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n14\n\nThere are basically two different types of imaging spacecraft, shown in Fig.\u00a02.9. \nA few imaging spacecraft \u201cfly\u201d horizontally, with the telescope parallel to the hori-\nzon. These use a 45\u00b0 elliptical mirror in front of the telescope to image the Earth. To \nchange the image position, only a light mirror needs to be moved in pitch and roll. \nThe spacecraft itself does not change attitude and can be pitch bias stabilized, sav-\ning the cost and weight of 2 reaction wheels. One advantage of this type of space-\ncraft is that pointing agility is easily achieved. Another is that it presents a small \ncross section, so aerodynamic drag is reduced, and aerodynamic torques are elimi-\nnated because the spacecraft CG and Center of Pressure are essentially colocated. \nOne of the disadvantages, however, is that the spacecraft is substantially longer to \nmake room for the gimbaled mirror in front of the telescope.\n\nFig. 2.8 Imaging spacecraft orbit and several imaging spacecraft\n\nTelescope and SC Horizontal with\nAttitude Fixed. Gimballed Mirror Steers\nImage in Pitch/Roll\n\nEntire SC is\nMoved to Point\nthe Target\n\nFig. 2.9 Two types of imaging spacecraft\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n15\n\nMost imaging spacecraft point to the target on the ground. To change aim point, \nthe spacecraft attitude must be changed. This requires a 3-axis stabilization system \nwith large enough reaction wheels to achieve the aim point agility required by the \nmission.\n\n2.3.1  Imaging Payload Fundamentals\n\nMost imaging spacecraft contain a telescope that looks at the Earth. The area on \nthe Earth imaged is centered at the telescope aim point. Ground resolution \nachievable is defined by the telescope Diffraction Limit, given in the equation at \nthe top of Fig.\u00a02.10. Diffraction limit (DL), telescope aperture (D), orbit altitude \n(H) and wavelength (?) are all in meters. For a spacecraft at 540-km altitude \nwith a 35-cm diameter telescope, the DL is given for three wavelengths in the \ntable in Fig.\u00a02.10. The DL varies between 0.753\u00a0m and 1.223\u00a0m, depending on \nthe wavelength.\n\nGeometrical resolution on the ground is usually defined as the Ground Sample \nDistance (GSD) and is given by the equation at the bottom of Fig.\u00a02.10. The space-\ncraft GSD (for nadir-pointing) depends on the spacecraft altitude (H), telescope \nfocal length (FL) and camera pixel size (P). At an off-nadir angle, ?, the GSD \nincreases as 1/cos(?).\n\nA numerical example is given in Fig.\u00a02.10 for ?\u00a0=\u00a00, H\u00a0=\u00a0540\u00a0km, camera pixel \nsize of 5.5*10?6\u00a0 m, telescope FL\u00a0 =\u00a0 3\u00a0 m and telescope aperture of 35\u00a0 cm. The \nGSD\u00a0=\u00a00.99 meter.\n\nA telescope with a 10-cm aperture may be flown on a CubeSat, while a tele-\nscope with a 35-cm aperture may be the largest that experimenters might fly. \nNote that the geometrical resolution, determined by the focal length of the tele-\nscope (for a given pixel size camera) is well matched to the diffraction limit in \nthese examples. In other words, trying to increase the focal length to get better \nresolution is not worth the effort, as the diameter establishes the diffraction \nlimit that cannot be bettered. Note that F#\u00a0=\u00a0FL/D\u00a0?\u00a0 8.57. The camera pixel \nsize, in this example, is 5.5\u00a0?m, such as the Truesense (Kodak) KAI-16050 16 \nMP CCD array.\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n16\n\nFig. 2.10 Diffraction limit as a function of wavelength\n\nGSD=1.22*?*H/D GSD=P*H/FL\nFL= FL= m\n\nm5.5E-06\n0.85\n\nDiff\nLimit m\n\n2.44\n2.75\n3.05\n3.36\n3.66\n3.97\n4.27\n4.58\n4.88\n\n8.50F#=FL/D=8.57F#=FL/D=\n5.1810\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n1035 0.73\n\n0.83\n0.92\n1.01\n1.10\n1.19\n1.28\n1.38\n1.47 1.39\n\n1.31\n1.22\n1.13\n1.05\n0.96\n0.87\n0.78\n0.70\n\n35\n35\n35\n35\n35\n35\n35\n35\n\n2.59\n\nGSD\n(nadir)D (cm)\n\nDiff\nLimit m\n\nGSD\n(nadir)\n\nD (cm)H (km)\n\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n\n?\n\n700\n750\n800GSD\n\nGSD=P*(H/FL)/cos(?)\n\n2.91\n3.24\n3.56\n3.88\n4.21\n4.53\n4.85\n\nFL\n\nP=pixel siz\n\nH\n\nP = P =\n3.00 m\n\nm5.5E-06\n\nFig. 2.11 Geometrical resolution and diffraction limit\n\n2.3.2  The Telescope\n\nA picture of a typical Cassagrain telescope is shown in Fig.\u00a0 2.12. The Primary \nMirror (PM) reflects the incident light, which is reflected by the Secondary Mirror \n(SM) to the camera Focal Plane. First, however, the light passes through corrector \nlenses, shown in the central tube. Since the Cassagrain Telescope folds the optical \npath in two, the actual length of the telescope is about half of the focal length.\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n17\n\nThe telescope is made of nearly zero temperature coefficient materials to ensure \nthat the telescope remains in focus over the temperature variations it will encounter in \nspace. The determination of how much of a dimensional change or elongation is per-\nmitted for the telescope to remain in focus is a very complicated matter and will not \nbe addressed here. However, according to a simple rule of thumb, the change in the FL \ndue to temperature variations should not cause the diameter of a spot to increase much \nover half the size of the camera CCD pixel. For a 35-cm diameter, nominally 3.0\u00a0m FL \ntelescope and 5.5*10?6 pixel size, this is a FL change of about 0.047\u00a0mm. Because the \noptical path is folded, the telescope structure must not change dimensions by more \nthan 0.023\u00a0mm. The thermal design of the telescope must achieve such dimensional \nstability over the temperature range the telescope will encounter in space.\n\nThis is a very challenging task. The temperature coefficients of different materi-\nals often used for constructing telescopes are Aluminum, Graphite Epoxy and Invar \n36. Their Temperature Coefficients are, respectively, 22.2\u00a0 pp/m/C\u00b0, 2.1\u00a0 pp/m/C\u00b0 \nand 1.2\u00a0pp/m/C\u00b0. The telescope length is approximately 1.5\u00a0m.\n\nThe fractional elongation of the telescope structure permitted is 7.66\u00a0 ppm. If \nmade of Aluminum, the maximum temperature change permitted is only 0.345 C\u00b0. \nIf made of Graphite Epoxy, the temperature could change by 3.64 C\u00b0; and if made \nof Invar 36, the temperature could change by 6.38 C\u00b0 before the telescope would \ndefocus. The thermal designs of the spacecraft and telescope are a major engineer-\ning challenge.\n\nFig. 2.12 Cassagrain telescope with camera and ray paths\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n18\n\n2.3.3  Image Quality\n\nFrom an optical design point of view, the performance of a telescope is typically \ncharacterized by the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). MTF is the spatial fre-\nquency response of the optical system. As in electronics, where a filter is character-\nized by its transfer function in the frequency domain, the MTF describes the ability \nof the optical system to pass or transfer an image.\n\nFigure 2.13 shows increasing frequency sinusoidal and rectangular amplitude bar \npatterns as inputs to an optical system. The spatial frequency is measured in line \npairs/mm. The output for each pattern and the system frequency response are shown \nbelow. Note that for a frequency response amplitude >10% of the low frequency response, \nthe image is reasonably good and usable. MTF\u00a0=\u00a010%, for this example, occurs at 70 \nlp/mm. The dimension of a line pair is 1/70th of a mm, or 14\u00a0?m. This is the resolu-\ntion of this optical system. If a CCD camera with 5.5-?m pixel size at the focal plane \nis used, the sharpest detail in the image would be greater than 2 pixels in size. A good \ndesign should provide an output that is better matched to pixel size.\n\nFor a typical telescope, MTF\u00a0>\u00a010% is often used to specify the response required \nfor an input image of the size of the GSD.\u00a0Of course, MTF\u00a0=\u00a010% should be achieved \neverywhere in the Field Of View of the image, not just at the center.\n\nSine Pattern Original\n\nSine Pattern with Lens\n\nBar Pattern with Lens\n\n100\n\n10\n\nM\nT\n\nF\n %\n\n A\nm\n\np\nlit\n\nu\nd\n\ne\n\n1\n10\n\nLine Pairs/mm\n100\n\n2\n\n5\n9=Rayleigh\nDiffraction\n\nLimit\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100\n\n%\n\nBar Pattern Original\n\nB\nar\n\n P\nat\n\nte\nrn\n\n (\nb\n\no\ntt\n\no\nm\n\n),\n S\n\nin\ne \n\nP\nat\n\nte\nrn\n\n (\nto\n\np\n)\n\nFig. 2.13 Modulation Transfer function (MTF) a spatial frequency  \nresponse of an optical system (Normal Koren)\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n19\n\nAnother measure of the quality of a system, from the point of view of a human \nobserver and his ability to interpret an image, is the National Image Interpretability \nRating Scale, NIIRS.\u00a0Since that takes into account many factors other than the tele-\nscope design, it will not be discussed here.\n\n2.3.4  Adequacy of\u00a0the\u00a0Light Input\n\nWe covered the subject of resolution. Now, we must determine how long an expo-\nsure time is required to get a good picture. The image Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) \nis determined by comparing the intensity of the image to the intensity of the back-\nground noise, Albedo and CCD electron noise. This is accomplished by performing \na radiometric analysis of the system (telescope, sun angle, time of day, season, lati-\ntude, etc.). An example of a radiometric analysis for a 35-cm aperture, 2.8-m focal \nlength telescope looking at the Earth from an altitude of 600\u00a0km at specified time \nand latitude, and using a camera exposure time of 150\u00a0?sec (one pixel spacecraft \ntravel time) is shown in Fig.\u00a02.14.\n\nThe CCD sensor noise is 16 electrons per pixel, and the sensor saturates at \n30,000 electrons. For various Sun elevation angles, the figure shows the number of \nimage electrons per pixel. If a 10 bit A/D converter is used to digitize the image, at \n90\u00b0 Sun elevation angle the image intensity is only 4.5 bits of the 10 bit converter \nrange. Pixel noise is 16 electrons/pixel; and the S/N per pixel varies from 21.84\u00a0dB \n(at 90\u00b0 elevation) to 12.03\u00a0dB (at 24.86\u00b0 elevation). The latter is not good enough \nfor a good picture.\n\nThe bottom left of the figure shows the time of day that the camera is usable and \nproduces enough light for a good picture. Although the fraction of the sensor \ndynamic range occupied by the image is small, the S/N is adequate for a good \npicture.\n\nAs seen from the green region of the figure, acceptable images can be produced \nfrom about 7\u00a0AM to about 4\u00a0PM.\u00a0If we increase the image exposure time to 750\u00a0?sec, \nsee Fig.\u00a02.15, the usable time of day increases by 1\u00a0h at each end of the day.\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n20\n\nFig. 2.14 Radiometric analysis to determine the image S/N\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n21\n\n2.3.5  Image Integration (Exposure) Time\n\nAs seen from the foregoing results, it may be advantageous to increase the image \nexposure time from the 150\u00a0?sec 1 pixel fly-bye time. There are two ways of increasing \nexposure time:\n\n (a) Impart to the spacecraft a negative pitch rate to increase the allowable dwell \ntime per pixel\n\n (b) Make the spacecraft point to the target, and keep pitch, roll or yaw slewing so \nthat the telescope aim point remains fixed\n\nFigure 2.16 shows the pitch rate needed to permit the effective exposure time to \nincrease, as shown. A pitch rate of ?0.60\u00b0/sec would permit an exposure time of about \n600\u00a0?sec, probably enough for most purposes. Of course, it takes time for the \nspacecraft to go from 0\u00b0/sec pitch rate to ?0.6\u00b0/sec pitch rate, and then return to 0 \nafter the image was taken. The elapsed time for the entire maneuver can be substantial \nand reduces the number of images that can be taken per unit time.\n\nFig. 2.15 Increasing exposure time to 750 ?sec adds 1 h of  \nusable time to each end of the day\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n22\n\nFig. 2.16 Establishing a negative spacecraft pitch rate increases  \nallowable image exposure time\n\nThe other alternative for increasing the available dwell time over a pixel is for the \nspacecraft to point to the target and stay pointing to it until the image is taken. There \nare two ways to point to the target:\n\n 1. Pitch and yaw to point to the target, then keep changing pitch and yaw. For this \ncase, the orientation of the image FOV keeps changing. It is more difficult to \n\u201cstitch\u201d successive pictures into a strip photo.\n\n 2. Roll the spacecraft to aim at a line parallel to the SC ground trace by an amount \nequal to the Spacecraft-Target CPA range, and continuously change the pitch to \nkeep pointing to the target. In this case, the image orientation remains constant and \nparallel to the spacecraft ground trace. It is much easier to \u201cstitch\u201d consecutive \nimages into a strip photo. In most cases, this second alternative is preferred.\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n23\n\nFig. 2.17 Spacecraft points to target either by pitch and yaw or by roll and pitch\n\n2.3.6  Pointing to\u00a0a\u00a0Target on\u00a0the\u00a0Ground\n\nThe procedures for both methods of pointing the spacecraft to the target are \ndescribed below and illustrated in Fig.\u00a02.17:\n\nComputing SC Yaw and Pitch Computing SC Roll and Pitch\n\n1. Compute SC-Target angle\nrelative to Lon line\n\n1. Compute the great circle range between \nSC and Target\n\n2. Subtract SC heading 2. From this, compute subtended angle\n3. Compute great circle range from\nSC to Target\n\n3. Determine the angle subtended by the \nCPA range\n\n4. From this, compute Earth subtended angle \nbetween SC- Earth Center and Target-to- Earth \nCenter lines\n\n4. In the plane defined by Target-Earth \nCenter and CPA- Earth Center lines \ndetermine Roll at CPA\n\n5. In the plane defined by the SC-Earth Center \nand the Target- Earth Center lines, we now have \n2 lines and the included angle. From these \ncompute Pitch. We have both Yaw & Pitch\n\n5. In the plane defined by the Roll angle, \nTarget and SC, determine the Pitch angle.\n\nThe computations in the tables above are illustrated in Fig.\u00a02.18.\nSpacecraft Yaw and Pitch required to point to the target is computed as follows: \n\nThe subsatellite point and target latitudes and longitudes are known and given for this \nexample in the top part of Fig.\u00a02.18. The orbit altitude and instantaneous satellite \nheading are also given. The SC to Target Azimuth is computed from the differences \nof Target-SC latitude and longitude. The spacecraft Yaw angle is then the difference \nbetween the SC-Target Azimuth and the instantaneous spacecraft heading.\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n24\n\nThe required Pitch is computed by first computing the ground range subtended \nangle, ?, and then, by using the law of cosines, the slant range. From the slant range \nand ?, the off-nadir angle or Pitch is computed by use of the law of sines.\n\nFor the case where pointing to the target is to be accomplished by a roll and pitch \nmaneuver, first the angle, ?, subtended by the cross track distance at CPA is com-\nputed. Then, the slant range at CPA is computed using the law of cosines. Finally, \nthe off nadir angle or pitch is computed using the law of sines.\n\nThese results are plotted in Figs.\u00a02.19 and 2.20 as functions of time.\n\nFig. 2.18 Equations and an example, the spacecraft points to the target  \nby yaw and pitch or by rolland pitch\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\nFig. 2.19 Spacecraft pitch and yaw as a function of time to keep the spacecraft  \npointing to the target\n\nFig. 2.20 Spacecraft roll and pitch as a function of time  \nto keep the spacecraft pointing to the target\n\n\n\n26\n\n2.3.7  Swath Width\n\nEarth coverage provided by an imaging spacecraft depends on the maximum Off- \nNadir look angle. For a 600-km orbit, Fig.\u00a02.21 illustrates the maximum ground range \nvisible from the spacecraft. At a 40\u00b0 Off-Nadir look angle, the ground elevation from \nthe target is about 45\u00b0. This is close to the lowest useful elevation angle for imaging. \nAt this angle, the ground range to the target is about 525\u00a0km. Thus, the swath width of \npotential coverage by this spacecraft is about 1050\u00a0km. However, the distance between \nsuccessive orbits is much greater, so there will be areas that the spacecraft cannot \ncover. Figure\u00a02.22 shows the ground distance at a constant latitude between successive \norbits as a function of latitude. It is evident that the spacecraft covers only a small \nfraction of the total area of the Earth. By choosing the orbit altitude, the rate at which \nsuccessive orbits cover different areas of the Earth can be controlled.\n\nFig. 2.21 Swath width as a function of Off-Nadir look angle  \nfor a 600-km altitude spacecraft\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n27\n\nFor the case where the orbit period is an exact sub-multiple of a day, after a cer-\ntain number of orbits, the initial orbit repeats exactly. Since the orbit period is a \nfunction of altitude, one can chose altitudes to make this happen. At other altitudes, \nthe orbit will precess either to the East or to the West, depending on altitude. \nFigure\u00a02.23 shows that at an altitude of ?567\u00a0km the orbit will repeat exactly in \n7\u00a0days. At an altitude of 590\u00a0km, the orbit precesses about 100\u00a0km to the West per \nday. Since the range between orbits at 38\u00b0 latitude is about 2400\u00a0km, it will take \nabout 240\u00a0days for the orbit to repeat exactly. But, since the swath width is about \n1100\u00a0km, a given target can be imaged in about 13\u00a0days (2400-1100)/100\u00a0=\u00a013. This \nis still a long time between image opportunities. Flying at 600\u00a0km increases the per \nday drift of the orbit to about 225\u00a0km/day, resulting in an opportunity to image the \ntarget in (2400-1100)/225\u00a0?\u00a05.7\u00a0days. The point of this example is that the choice of \naltitude has a significant impact on the utility of an imaging spacecraft, making it \nvery important to carefully study the impact of altitude choice.\n\nSpacecraft Altitude (A km)\nLatitude 400 500 600 700 800 900 1,000 1,100 1,200\n\n0 2,576 2,633 2,691 2,749 2,807 2,866 2,926 2,985 3,045\n10 2,537 2,593 2,650 2,707 2,765 2,823 2,881 2,940 2.999\n20 2,421 2,475 2,529 2,583 2,638 2,693 2,749 2,805 2,852\n30 2,231 2,281 2,330 2,381 2,431 2,482 2,534 2,585 2,637\n40 1,973 2,017 2,061 2,106 2,151 2,196 2,241 2,287 2,333\n50 1,656 1,693 1,730 1,767 1,805 1,842 1,881 1,919 1,958\n60 1,288 1,317 1,345 1,375 1,404 1,433 1,463 1,493 1,523\n70 881 901 920 940 960 980 1,001 1,021 1,042\n80 447 457 467 477 488 498 508 518 529\n90 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRange (km) per Orbit at Constant Latitude\nPeriod (min) = P = 2*?*((A+R)3\u00b5)0.5\n\nEarth Circumference at Altitude = C = 2*\u00b5*(R+A)\nEarth Turns per Orbit (deg) = OD = 360*P/1440\n\nOrbit-to-Orbit Distance at Lat (deg) = R*cos(Lat)*OD\n\nFig. 2.22 Range at constant latitude between successive orbits vs. latitude\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n28\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n-100\n\nToward\nthe West\n\nToward\nthe East\n\nKm of Orbit Drift from Day-to-Day (at Latitude=38\u00b0)\nD\n\nay\n-t\n\no-\nD\n\nay\n O\n\nrb\nit \n\nD\nrif\n\nt (\nkm\n\n)\n\n-200\n\n-300\n\n-400\n\n-500\n600 590 580 570 560 550 540 530 520 510 500\n\nOrbit Altitude (km)\n\nFig. 2.23 Orbit drift as a function of spacecraft altitude\n\n2.3.8  Spacecraft Agility and\u00a0Targeting\n\nIn a typical imaging scenario, the goal is to image as many targets as possible, but \nspacecraft agility limits the target set that can be imaged on a given pass. Targets \nmust be within the swath as well as within similar Off-Nadir angles. For example, \nif a spacecraft can slew at an average rate of 4\u00b0/second (this is a very agile space-\ncraft), then (ignoring slew acceleration, deceleration and settling time) it takes \nabout 40\u00b0 in roll to go from a target 200\u00a0km on one side of the ground trace to \nanother target 200\u00a0km on the other side of the ground trace. It takes, nominally, \n10\u00a0 s to accomplish this maneuver during which the spacecraft traveled about \n70\u00a0km. Adding acceleration, deceleration and settling time to the time to slew 40\u00b0, \nthe downrange distance the spacecraft travels between these two targets is much \ngreater than 70\u00a0km. To determine spacecraft agility requirements, typical scenar-\nios should be simulated. To render the spacecraft agile, the size of the reaction \nwheels or control moment gyros must be large. Sizing these will be covered in the \nchapter on Attitude Control.\n\n2.3.9  Imaging Spacecraft Attitude Sensing, Control Requirements\n\nImaging spacecraft pose the greatest challenge to the attitude sensing and control \nsubsystem. Positioning the center of an image with 100\u00a0m accuracy, from an altitude \nof 600\u00a0km, for example, requires the ability to sense spacecraft attitude with an \n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n29\n\naccuracy of 0.00477\u00b0 (16.92 arc seconds) and to control pointing with an accuracy \nof 0.00955\u00b0. Attitude control accuracy is typically a factor of 2 worse than attitude \nsensing accuracy. Star trackers can provide this accuracy. Modest cost small star \ntrackers achieve accuracies on the order of 25 arc seconds; the best, large star track-\ners can achieve about 3 arc-seconds (0.00083\u00b0). With such a star tracker, the aim \npoint from 600\u00a0km is accurate to 8.7\u00a0m.\n\nThe mission dictates the pointing accuracy required. For example, if the mission \nrequires only that the target be contained in the picture taken, there is no need for \nthe pointing accuracy to be greater than 10% of the image FOV.\u00a0For a 10 MP image \nwith a GSD of 1.0 meter, the image is 2.582\u00a0km by 3.873\u00a0km; and 10% of this is \nabout 250 meters. An attitude sensor with 0.0119\u00b0 (42.9 arc-sec) can control the \nspacecraft to the required pointing accuracy. Even a small, relatively inexpensive \nStar tracker can do this. If, on the other hand, the position of points on Earth needs \nto be determined with (say) 20-m accuracy, a star tracker with 0.0019\u00b0 or 6.8 arc-sec \naccuracy is needed. The difference in cost, size and weight of these two Star Trackers \nis enormous.\n\nBecause a typical star tracker FOV is about 15\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00b0, in an imaging spacecraft \napplication usually two star trackers are used.\n\nIn addition to pointing accuracy, as previously mentioned, the scenario also \ndrives the required slew rate.\n\n2.3.10  Data Quantity and\u00a0Downlink Data Rate\n\nTaking strip photographs places a large demand on both data storage and downlink \ndata rate requirements. In the previous example, a 10 MP image at 1.0\u00a0m GSD was \n2.582\u00a0km by 3.873\u00a0km. If the longer dimension is along the spacecraft ground track, \nand assuming a 10% overlap between successive pictures is required, about 2 pic-\ntures per second must be taken. Thus, the spacecraft accumulates image data at the \nrate of 20 MP/sec, or, if the image is digitized to 24 bits per pixel, the rate of image \ndata accumulation is 480 Mbits per second (before FEC and Encryption).\n\nIf a strip photo is to cover 20\u00a0km along the spacecraft ground track, then the strip \nwould contain 6 images, resulting in 1.44 Gbits of data. At 4 Mbps data rate, it \nwould take 6\u00a0min\u00a0- the duration of a typical pass\u00a0- to get imagery from a single strip \nto the Ground Station.\n\nBy JPG compressing the images, the downlink time could be cut to 1\u00a0min (10\u00a0s \nper image). In a typical pass, a total of about 36 images could be downlinked.\n\nIf the mission requirement exceeds this capacity, there are several alternatives for \nincreasing the spacecraft image downlink throughput. The downlink data rate could \nbe increased. Additionally, near-Polar ground stations could be employed so that \nimage data could be downlinked during each pass and transmitted to its destination \nvia terrestrial means. Or a data relay, such as a Geostationary satellite, could be used \nto permit more continuous data dumps to ground.\n\n2.3  Satellite Imaging\n\n\n\n30\n\n2.3.11  An Imaging Scenario\n\nNow let us go through a sample imaging scenario. Figure\u00a02.24 shows England and \nIreland. A 600-km nearly polar orbit spacecraft ground trace is shown in red, while \nthe \u00b1300\u00a0km swath limits, corresponding to a maximum of \u00b130\u00b0 Off-Nadir angle \nroll, are shown by the yellow lines.\n\nThe 5 intended targets are shown in yellow, and straight lines connecting the \ntargets are shown in green.\n\nTarget coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) are shown in Fig.\u00a02.25. The time \nshown in this figure is the time in seconds the spacecraft will reach CPA to each \ntarget. The entire scenario is 140\u00a0s. The image longitudes are the distances in km \nfrom the spacecraft ground trace.\n\nThe last column shows the average roll rate in degrees/sec that the spacecraft has \nto be able to execute to slew from one target to the next.\n\nThe peak slew rate is between targets 3 and 4, where the average slew rate has to \nbe ?0.209\u00b0/sec. This is a slow slew rate that the spacecraft can execute.\n\nFig. 2.24 Imaging scenario shows 5 targets to be imaged, the  \nspacecraft ground trace and the slew limits\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n31\n\nFig. 2.25 Target Lat/Lon, Spacecraft CPA Times, Average roll rates\n\nHowever, if an additional target, shown in white, is added, the maximum average \nslew rate would become 0.6\u00b0/sec, and the spacecraft may not be able to slew that \nfast. In this case, imaging the target on this pass may have to be omitted.\n\n2.4  Satellite Constellations\n\n2.4.1  Present Constellations\n\nThe purpose of using a constellation of satellites is to increase geographic coverage \non the Earth surface or to reduce revisit time. There are several satellite constella-\ntions now, and many are planned for the future. Most present constellations are for \nnavigation by use of satellites at MEO orbit, or for communications with satellites \nat LEO orbits. The major orbital characteristics of several constellations are listed \nin Fig.\u00a02.26. Pictures of the orbits of GPS and Globalstar are shown in Fig.\u00a02.27a, b.\n\nName Purpose Country SC Planes SC/Plane Alt \n(km)\n\nGPS Navigation USA 24 6 4 20,180\nGLOSSNAS Navigation Russia 24 3 8 19,100\n\nIridium Phone Communication USA 66 6 11 781\nOrbcomm Store-Forward Comms USA 30 4 6-8 825\nGlobalstar Communication EU 24 8 3 1,400\n\nGalileo Navigation EU 30 3 8+spares 23,222\nBei Dou Regional Navigation China 4 N/A N/A GEO\n\nQuasi-Zenith Regional Navigation Japan 4 N/A N/A 42,164\nRegional Nav Indian Regional Nav System India 4 N/A N/A 36,000\n\nFig. 2.26 Several satellite constellations\n\n2.4  Satellite Constellations\n\n\n\n32\n\nFig. 2.28 Illustration of earth coverage by a polar plane of 600-km altitude spacecraft\n\nThe main drivers in the design of a satellite constellation are (1) mission-imposed \nrequirements, (2) degree of coverage (or permissible holidays of coverage), (3) \nnumber of planes and launches, (4) orbital altitude and (5) cost. Figure\u00a02.28 illus-\ntrates a Polar plane of 8 spacecraft in a multi-plane constellation of satellites. In the \nillustration, each spacecraft is at an altitude of 550\u00a0km. The\u00a0orange cones represent \nthe coverage limits of the satellites. Each cone is tangent to the Earth surface at the \nedge of coverage. There are gaps in coverage between adjacent spacecraft.\n\nIn the following, the number of spacecraft in a plane, the number of planes and \nspacecraft altitudes will be considered to determine constellation coverage of the \nEarth. While the example is for Polar orbits, coverage considerations for differently \ninclined orbits are similar.\n\nFig. 2.27 (a) GPS constellation of 24 spacecraft. (b) Globalstar constellation of 24 spacecraft\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n33\n\n2.4.2  Coverage and\u00a0Gaps\n\nFigure 2.29 shows the ground range from a spacecraft at varying altitudes.\nWhen a number of spacecraft are equally spaced in an orbit of a given altitude, \n\ntheir coverage may have gaps between adjacent spacecraft, shown in Fig.\u00a02.28, or \ntheir coverage may overlap. Figure\u00a02.30 shows the length of the gap (or overlapping \ncoverage) as a function of spacecraft altitude and the number of spacecraft in the \nsame plane of the orbit. If there were 9 spacecraft per plane, then, at an orbit altitude \nas low as 400\u00a0km, the coverage circles of adjacent spacecraft would just touch. At \nhigher altitudes, spacecraft coverage would overlap, with the number of kilometers \nof the overlap indicated by the figure. With only 8 spacecraft per plane, orbit altitude \nwould have to be raised to about 540\u00a0km to achieve the same result.\n\nFig. 2.29 Ground range vs. altitude\n\nThe amount of overlap determines the swath width in which continuous coverage \nis achieved. In the Orbcomm constellation, for instance, at an orbit altitude of 825\u00a0km, \noverlapping coverage starts with about 6.5 spacecraft per plane. Orbcomm uses 6-8 \nspacecraft per plane. Iridium, flying at 781\u00a0km altitude, uses 11 spacecraft per plane, \nclearly achieving sufficient overlap for continuous coverage, which is required by the \ncontinuous voice communication mission. By contrast, Orbcomm is a store-forward \nsystem and does not require overlapping coverage. Nevertheless, in a plane with only \n6 spacecraft, the coverage gap is a minimum of 300\u00a0km, or about 43\u00a0s.\n\nThe swath width as a function of the number of spacecraft per plane, and orbit \naltitude are shown in Fig.\u00a02.31. It is seen that for 6 spacecraft per plane the swath is \npretty small until an altitude of about 1100\u00a0km. For 8 spacecraft per plane, the orbit \ncan be as low as 700\u00a0km for a reasonable swath width.\n\n2.4  Satellite Constellations\n\n\n\n34\n\nFig. 2.30 Overlapping coverage vs. the number of spacecraft per plane and altitude\n\nFig. 2.31 Swath width as a function of the number of spacecraft per  \nplane and orbit altitude\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n35\n\nThe overlap (or gap of coverage) between planes also depends on the latitude. \nFor example, for a Polar orbiting constellation, each of the satellites in each of the \nplanes covers the Polar region. Above a certain latitude, adjacent planes start to \noverlap. Below that same latitude there will be coverage gaps. Figure\u00a02.32 illus-\ntrates above what latitude overlap starts, as a function of the number of equally \nspaced planes and swath width. The ordinate of the graph is the number of kilome-\nters of gap or overlap.\n\nFig. 2.32 Planes overlap above a certain latitude, and there are gaps below that latitude. Positive \nnumbers show the size of the gaps, negative numbers show the amount of overlap\n\nAn illustration, shown in Fig.\u00a02.33, shows 8 spacecraft distributed uniformly on \na 700-km, 65\u00b0 orbit. There is a small amount of overlap in their footprints, making \nit possible to cover the swath width almost continuously.\n\nWhen 3 planes of such spacecraft are on orbit, shown in Fig.\u00a02.34, it is evident \nthat every point on Earth is covered almost continuously. Thus, a 24-spacecraft \nconstellation is almost large enough for continuous Earth coverage (from a com-\nmunications point of view).\n\n2.4  Satellite Constellations\n\n\n\n36\n\nFig. 2.33 Single 65\u00b0 inclination plane at 700 km with 8 spacecraft\n\nFig. 2.34 Three planes of 8 spacecraft per plane at 700-km altitude and 65\u00b0 inclination provides \nalmost continuous coverage\n\n2 Satellite Missions\n\n\n\n37\n\n2.4.3  Other Satellite Constellation Considerations\n\nLaunch Vehicles Constellations consist of a number of planes of spacecraft. It is \nimportant to have each of the spacecraft in a plane at the same altitude and inclina-\ntion. For this reason, if possible, all of the spacecraft of a plane, including on-orbit \nspares, should be launched on the same launch vehicle.\n\nDistributing the individual spacecraft of a plane launched by one launch vehicle \ncan be done by having the launch vehicle deliver each spacecraft to its station, or by \nhaving the propulsion systems of the individual spacecraft move the spacecraft to its \nstation. The former would require the launch vehicle to have restartable engines. For \nthis reason, the latter approach is used most often.\n\nStation Keeping Station keeping can be a real manpower driver at the ground station. \nIn a 24-spacecraft constellation, if a station keeping maneuver is performed once \nevery 72\u00a0days on each spacecraft, then a station keeping maneuver has to be per-\nformed every 3\u00a0days. It is desirable that station keeping maneuvers be automated.\n\nMaximum Off-Nadir Angle Some missions, such as imaging, require that the Off- \nNadir angle be limited. For example, if the target is to be imaged at a look angle \ngreater than (say) 30\u00b0 by a 600-km altitude constellation, the spacecraft off-nadir \nangle should not exceed 52.3\u00b0. This corresponds to a maximum ground range of \n843\u00a0km from the subsatellite point. While the horizon is 2631\u00a0km away, the useful \nmaximum range for imaging can be substantially less. For this reason, imagery \ncoverage requires more spacecraft per plane, or coverage gaps have to be accepted. \nObviously, this is a major cost driver.\n\nConstellation Communications For some missions, intermittent spacecraft-to- \nground communications is adequate. The Store-and-Forward digital  communications \nsystem, Orbcomm, is an example. Imaging satellite systems can also operate with \njust spacecraft-to-ground communications of their images. However, a system \ndesigned for continuous access from and to the spacecraft must use either ground \nstation communications relays, GEO satellite relays (like TDRS) or intersatellite \nlinks (like Iridium).\n\n2.4  Satellite Constellations\n\n\n\n39\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

However, because of local ground terrain obstructions, typically \nonly a ground range to the 10\u00b0 elevation range circle is used for communications \npurposes. This ground range is only 1740\u00a0km. Therefore, the satellite useful swath \nwidth (from a communications point of view) is 3480\u00a0km; and the useful ground \nstation access times are shorter than those listed in Fig.\u00a03.3b.\n\n3.3  Spacecraft Elevation, Slant Range, CPA, Ground Range\n\nThe most often used geometrical relationships for circular orbit spacecraft will be \ndescribed in this section.

The ground range between the spacecraft subsat-\nellite point and the ground station is GR, while the ground range from the  subsatellite \npoint to the CPA point is GRCPA. The central angle subtended by GR is ?, by GRCPA \nis ?, and by the CPA distance is ?.\n\nFor an altitude of 600\u00a0km, a CPA distance of 250\u00a0km and an elevation angle of \n5\u00b0, the left-hand column gives the numerical results, while the right-hand column \ngives the equations from which the numerical results were computed.\n\nFig. 3.5 Slant and ground range (km) vs. elevation angle for various spacecraft altitudes\n\n3.3 Spacecraft Elevation, Slant Range, CPA, Ground Range\n\n\n\n44\n\nFig. 3.6 Geometry and example for 600-km orbit and general  \nequations, taking CPA into consideration\n\n3 Orbits and\u00a0Spacecraft-Related Geometry\n\n\n\n45\n\nFig. 3.7 Elevation angle vs. ground range to CPA, various CPA\n\nThe first thing to note is that as the CPA increases, the maximum elevation angle \nreached during a pass is reduced, as is the duration of the pass. This is illustrated in \nFig.\u00a03.7. For higher orbit altitudes, the peak elevation angle increases for the same \nCPA distance. Since this figure is plotted against the ground range to CPA, it also \nillustrates the elevation angle vs. time (when ground range is converted to time by \nthe spacecraft ground velocity). The Azimuth vs. range to CPA is in Fig.\u00a03.8.\n\nThe reduction of the pass duration as the CPA is increased is shown in Fig.\u00a03.9. \nHere, pass duration is expressed as a function of the minimum elevation angle, \nwhich is considered to be the beginning of a pass. This is relevant because a pass in \na mountainous region with low horizon obstructions may not be of value until a \ngiven minimum elevation angle (like 5\u00b0 or 10\u00b0) is reached.\n\n3.3 Spacecraft Elevation, Slant Range, CPA, Ground Range\n\n\n\n46\n\nFig. 3.9 Pass duration vs. minimum elevation angle for various CPA\n\nFig. 3.8 Azimuth or yaw to target vs. range to CPA\n\n3 Orbits and\u00a0Spacecraft-Related Geometry\n\n\n\n47\n\nFigure 3.9 shows that, for example, for a CPA\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0km and a minimum eleva-\ntion angle of 15\u00b0, the pass is 6\u00a0minutes long. For a CPA\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0km, the pass is only \n4.5\u00a0minutes long.\n\nFigure 3.10 illustrates how pass duration increases with orbit altitude (for \nCPA\u00a0=\u00a00).\n\n3.4  Pointing to\u00a0a\u00a0Target on\u00a0the\u00a0Ground From\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft\n\nIn many situations, such as in imaging a ground target from the spacecraft, the Pitch \nand Yaw angles from the spacecraft must be known to be able to point to the target. \nThe target does not lie on the spacecraft ground track, but is off at a range of CPA \nkm at the spacecraft Closest Point of Approach. The geometrical situation is shown \non the left side of Fig.\u00a03.11. The figure on the right is in the plane defined by the \nspacecraft, the center of the Earth and the Target. It is used only to assist in the deri-\nvation of the relevant equations. The equations are shown in Fig.\u00a03.12 for a 600-km \norbit and a CPA of 500\u00a0km.\n\nFig. 3.10 Pass duration a function of minimum elevation angle  \n(for various orbit altitudes and for CPA\u00a0=\u00a00)\n\n3.4 Pointing to\u00a0a\u00a0Target on\u00a0the\u00a0Ground From\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft\n\n\n\n48\n\nFig. 3.12 Spacecraft pitch, yaw to aim at ground target, various CPA\n\nFig. 3.11 Spacecraft pointing to target at CPA km from ground track  \nand geometry in plane of\u00a0target, spacecraft and earth center\n\nAbove, the spacecraft look angles to the ground target are given as Pitch and \nYaw. However, in many instances, it is more convenient to use spacecraft Roll \nand Pitch. In Sect. 2.3, the equations for that situation were derived. In \nFig.\u00a03.13, the Pitch, Yaw and Elevation are plotted for a 600-km orbit and a \ntarget CPA of 500\u00a0km.\n\n3 Orbits and\u00a0Spacecraft-Related Geometry\n\n\n\n49\n\n3.5  Ballistic Coefficient and\u00a0On-Orbit Life\n\nBallistic Coefficient is the ratio of spacecraft mass to its drag. It is B\u00a0=\u00a0M/CDA, \nwhere M is the mass, CD is the drag coefficient and A is the cross sectional area of \nthe spacecraft. For example, a 200 lbs 24\u201d\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024\u201d\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u201d nadir-pointing spacecraft has \na cross sectional area of 720 sq. in (0.465 sq. m), a mass of 6.23 slugs (90.9\u00a0kg), a \ncoefficient of drag of 2 and a Ballistic Coefficient of 97.7. Typical spacecraft bal-\nlistic coefficients vary between 50 and 200.\n\nFig. 3.13 Pitch and yaw from spacecraft to target (600-km Altitude, 500\u00a0km CPA)\n\n3.5 Ballistic Coefficient and\u00a0On-Orbit Life\n\n\n\n50\n\nAlt\nkm\n\nEstimated Orbit Lifetime\nSolar Min\n50 kg/m\u00b2\n\n(days)\n\nSolar Max\n50 kg/m\u00b2\n\n(days)\n\nSolar Min\n200 kg/m\u00b2\n\n(days)\n\nSolar Max\n200 kg/m\u00b2\n\n(days)\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n100 0.04 0.06 0.06 0.06\n150 0.24 0.18 0.54 0.48\n200 1.65 1.00 5.99 3.60\n250 10.04 3.82 40.21 14.98\n300 49.90 11.0 196.7 49.2\n350 195.6 30.9 615.9 140.3\n400 552.2 77.4 1,024 346.9\n450 872 181 1,497 724\n500 1,205 393 2,377 3,110\n\nYears from this Row Down\nYears\n\n550 4.5 2.2 15.0 13.1\n600 9.0 7.0 38.6 36.7\n650 15.2 12.5 78.1 76.4\n700 36.7 34.5 146 144\n750 67 66 270 268\n800 115 112 480 477\n850 209 208 842 840\n900 348 342 1,427 1,425\n950 605 575 2,337 2,334\n\n1000 934 931 3,739 3,732\n\nFig. 3.15 Orbit decay rate and orbit life time vs. altitude and  \nballistic coefficient (NASA)\n\nFig. 3.14 Orbit life and atmospheric density\n\n3 Orbits and\u00a0Spacecraft-Related Geometry\n\n\n\n51\n\nFig. 3.16 Eclipse (min) vs. Beta for 600- and 800-km Orbits\n\nThe website https://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/mitigation/das.html pro-\nvides downloadable NASA software for computing orbit life.\n\n3.6  Computing the\u00a0Projection of\u00a0the\u00a0Sun on\u00a0Planes \non\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft\n\nTo compute the power produced by a set of solar panels on the spacecraft, the projec-\ntion of the sun on each panel must be computed. Using unit area panels, the projec-\ntion of the Sun is a function of true anomaly and Beta. Ignoring eclipse, for the \nmoment, the power produced by the 5 main panels (+X, ?X, +Y, ?Y and +Z) can be \ncomputed with the aid of the downloadable spreadsheet listed in the Chap. 21.\n\nThe Sun projection on panels in other orientations can be computed from the \nprojections on these 5 principal panels. The bottom panel (?Z) is usually not avail-\nable for power generation for it contains the separation system.\n\nNext, eclipse must be factored in. Eclipse is a function of Beta and altitude. \nFigure\u00a0 3.16 shows the eclipse duration vs. Beta for a 600-km and an 800-km \norbit.\n\n3.6 Computing the\u00a0Projection of\u00a0the\u00a0Sun on\u00a0Planes on\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft\n\nhttps://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/mitigation/das.html\n\n\n52\n\nNote that (1) Beta does not vary much with altitude, and (2) for Beta\u00a0>\u00a0?65\u00b0, \nthere is no Eclipse; the spacecraft is in sunshine all the time.\n\nThe eclipse duration corresponds to an anomaly angle range that straddles 0\u00b0 \nanomaly (when the sun is in the equatorial plane). For instance, for \u00df\u00a0=\u00a00 the Eclipse \nis 35.36\u00a0minutes long, and, since the orbit period is 96.518\u00a0minutes, the eclipse lasts \nfor an anomaly range of 131.89\u00b0. The anomaly ranges from 360\u2013131.89/2\u00a0=\u00a0294.155\u00b0 \nto 131.89/2\u00a0=\u00a065.945\u00b0.\n\nFigures 3.17, 3.18, 3.19 and 3.20 show the instantaneous powers of the 5 panels \nand the OAP of the sum. The spreadsheet from which these figures are obtained is \namong the downloadable spreadsheets listed in the Chap. 21.\n\nFig. 3.17 \u00df\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0, Inc.\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0 Only +X, ?X, +Z panels contribute to power\n\nNote that the OAP (if each of the 5 panels have unit areas) is 0.748. Since there \nare 5 panels, the OAP produced is 14.96% of the solar cell power purchased and \ninstalled. Also note that the top (+Z) panel contributes almost half of the total OAP. \nIf it were not used, the OAP would drop to 9.35% of the 4 remaining panel powers.\n\nAs \u00df is increased (to 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0) the OAP increases because more panels con-\ntribute and because the eclipse is shorter. See Fig.\u00a03.18.\n\n3 Orbits and\u00a0Spacecraft-Related Geometry\n\n\n\n53\n\nNote that now, the -Y panel starts to contribute, and the eclipse spans only \n109.25\u00b0.\n\nIncreasing \u00df to 90\u00b0, Fig.\u00a03.19, shows that there is no eclipse and that the OAP is \n1.213 or 24.26% of the installed power.\n\nLowering the inclination to 65\u00b0 reduces the OAP somewhat (to 1.107), resulting \nin an overall OAP efficiency of 22.14%.\n\nIf computation of the power produced by some other panel is desired, it can be \nconstructed from the components of the 5 panels given here. For example, to \n compute the contribution of a panel tilted up 45\u00b0, we simply take 0.707 of the +Z \nand 0.707 of the (say)\u00a0+\u00a0X panel as a function of the anomaly, and compute the OAP \nas anomaly advances from 0 to 360\u00b0.\n\nFig. 3.18 \u00df\u00a0=\u00a045\u00b0 OAP increased to 1.088 or 21.76% of installed power\n\n3.6 Computing the\u00a0Projection of\u00a0the\u00a0Sun on\u00a0Planes on\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft\n\n\n\n54\n\nFig. 3.20 As inclination is reduced, OAP decreases slightly\n\nFig. 3.19 For \u00df\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0 There is no more eclipse\n\n3 Orbits and\u00a0Spacecraft-Related Geometry\n\n\n\n55\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

It is often about 25% of the weight and 25% of the cost of a spacecraft. Electric \nPower is also often underestimated, resulting in insufficient power to support the \n\u201cmission creep\u201d requirements of the spacecraft. The EPS design procedure is out-\nlined below. Each of the steps will be discussed and illustrated in more detail later.\n\n (A) Determine the Required Spacecraft Orbit Average Power\n\n\u2022 List all of the electronic components of the satellite and the voltages and \ncurrents that each component requires\n\n\u2022 Determine the power drawn by each component in each of the spacecraft \noperating modes. Augment these by the appropriate DC/DC conversion effi-\nciency to obtain the OAP drawn from each voltage source in each spacecraft \noperating mode.\n\n\u2022 Determine the peak OAP required\n\n (B) Determine the Battery Capacity Required and Choose the Battery Bus \nVoltage\n\n\u2022 Based on the power drawn during the eclipse (and the maximum eclipse \nduration), determine the battery WH requirements\n\n\u2022 Select the battery cells that will be used\n\u2022 Applying the battery output vs. input efficiency, determine the battery WH \n\nused during the eclipse\n\u2022 Select the maximum Depth of Discharge below which the batteries should \n\nnot be discharged. Apply this, and a large safety factor, to obtain the battery \nWH to be installed.\n\n\u2022 Choose a battery bus voltage and divide by the cell voltage to determine the \nnumber of cells in series (in a string) of cells. Divide the total battery current \nby the current each parallel string will supply to determine the number of \nparallel battery strings.\n\n\n\n56\n\n (C) Select a Solar Panel Configuration and Compute the OAP it can Supply\n\n\u2022 Select the solar panel configuration (the orientations and areas of each panel \nrelative to the spacecraft axes). Also, determine how each panel will be \nstowed and released.\n\n\u2022 Compute the instantaneous power generated by each panel as the spacecraft \nmoves around an orbit. The total power vs. time is then computed, as is the OAP.\n\n\u2022 Repeat this for all Beta angles (the angle between the sun line and the orbit \nplane) to determine what the minimum OAP is. Ensure that the minimum \nOAP generated is equal to or greater than the spacecraft OAP required.\n\n (D) Draw the EPS Block Diagram\n\n\u2022 Given the panel configuration, the various required voltages and the number of \nbattery strings and cells per string, the EPS block diagram can now be drawn.\n\n\u2022 Consider which groups of components should be turned ON/OFF on com-\nmand, and whether the switch to turn these groups ON/OFF should be ahead \nor after the respective DC/DC converters that supply the voltage to the group.\n\n (E) Miscellaneous EPS Design Steps\n\n\u2022 Often, an EPS computer is included to collect telemetry regarding the state \nof health of the EPS, the battery capacity status, component temperatures \nand EPS status. This computer may also be used to turn ON/OFF power to \nthe various electronic components.\n\n\u2022 The Separation Switch that signals release from the launch vehicle and the \nstart of spacecraft operations is also part of the EPS.\u00a0The functions enabled \nor disabled to ensure that no electric power is drained from the spacecraft \nprior to launch are used to determine where in the spacecraft circuit the \nSeparation Switch should be located.\n\n4.1  Required Orbit Average Power (OAP)\n\nThe procedure above is illustrated for a 3-axis stabilized spacecraft that has two star \ntrackers for attitude determination, a camera and image processor payload, an \nS-Band downlink communication transmitter and a UHF uplink command system. \nIt also has a separate Command & Data Handling (C&DH) computer.\n\nThe three operating modes of the spacecraft are:\n\n\u2022 Idle Mode\u00a0- when no communications or imaging takes place, but all other sys-\ntems are operating. In this mode, the CMD receiver is ON.\n\n\u2022 Imaging Mode\u00a0- when the camera and image processing computer are turned \nON, but when there is no downlink communications\n\n\u2022 Communications Mode\u00a0- when the spacecraft downlinks telemetry and image \ndata and receives commands from the ground station. In this example, it is \nassumed that downlink takes place for 5\u00a0min (out of a total orbit period of 90\u00a0min).\n\n4 Electric Power Subsystem Design\n\n\n\n57\n\nThe table in Fig.\u00a04.1 shows the power consumption of each component and the \nvoltage source from which it draws the power. The first group of three columns \nshows the peak powers required from each DC/DC converter. The DC/DC converter \nefficiencies (in %) are also shown.\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd and 4th groups of columns show the component percent utilizations \nin each of the three spacecraft operating modes. The OAP, after accounting for DC/\nDC converter efficiencies in each of the three modes, are shown in the OAP in Each \nOp Mode row. The peak OAP requirement for which the EPS must be designed is \nshown in the last row as the maximum of the OAP requirements in each of the three \noperating modes.\n\nSpacecraft OAP \nRequirements\n\nWatts at \nVoltages Idle Mode Watts\n\nImaging Mode \nWatts\n\nCommunications \nMode Watts\n\n5v 12v 28v % 5v 12v 28v % 5v 12v 28v % 5v 12v 28v\nC&DH 1.5 100 1.5 100 1.5 100 1.5\nEPS Processor 0.2 100 0.2 100 0.2 100 0.2\nImaging Payload\nCamera 4.0 10 0.4\nImage Processor 3.0 15 0.5\nADACS\nPitch Reaction Wheel 3.5 100 3.5 100 3.5 100 3.5\nRoll Reaction Wheel 3.5 100 3.5 100 3.5 100 3.5\nYaw Reaction Wheel 3.5 100 3.5 100 3.5 100 3.5\nStar Tracker #1 0.5 100 0.5 100 0.5 100 0.5\nStar Tracker $2 0.5 100 0.5 100 0.5 100 0.5\nCourse Sun Sensors 0.4 100 0.4 100 0.4 100 0.5\n3 Torque Rods 0.8 100 0..8 100 0.8 100 0.8\nCommunication\nTTM & Image Xmitter 30.0 5.5 1.6\nCMD Receiver 1.5 100 1.5 100 100 1.5\nPeak and AvePower 6.1 36.3 10.5 3.1 2.3 10.5 3.6 1.2 10.5 3.2 3.9 10.5\nDC/DC Converter Eff. % 87 85 85 87 85 85 87 85 85 87 85 85 \nOAP from Each Source 7.0 42.7 12.4 3.6 2.7 12.4 4.1 1.4 12.4 3.7 4.6 12.4\nOAP in Each Op Mode 18.7 17.9 20.7\nDesign for OAP of 20.7\n\nFig. 4.1 Developing spacecraft orbit average power requirements\n\n4.2  Battery Capacity and\u00a0Battery System Design\n\n4.2.1  Battery Capacity\n\nSelect the spacecraft operating mode when it will be in the eclipse. This is usually \nthe Idle Mode. The spacecraft will spend a maximum of about 35\u00a0min in eclipse per \norbit, during which it must be powered from the battery. In the above example, the \nIdle Mode power is 18.622 watts, and the battery energy used in eclipse is Eclipse \nPower\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Max Eclipse Duration/60\u00a0min\u00a0=\u00a018.622*35/60\u00a0=\u00a010.868 WH.\n\nTypical battery output vs. input efficiencies are 85%. That is, 100/85\u00a0=\u00a01.176 \ntimes the battery capacity is required to provide the required battery output WH.\u00a0In \nthe above example, this raises the battery capacity requirement to 12.780 WH.\n\n4.2 Battery Capacity and Battery System Design\n\n\n\n58\n\nNext, consider the expected mission and battery life that the EPS must support. \nIn Low Earth Orbit (LEO), a satellite orbits the Earth typically 15 times per day. \nTherefore, the battery will be charged and discharged about 5000 times per year. A \nbattery\u2019s useful life depends on the average Depth Of Discharge (DOD). The smaller \nthe DOD, the longer the battery life. A typical Lithium Battery life vs. average DOD \nis shown in Fig.\u00a04.2.\n\nFigure 4.2 shows that if 5-year mission life is desired, the DOD should be less \nthan 15%. For 10-year mission life, a DOD of 10% may be appropriate. Thus, the \nbattery capacity that must be provided is many times that which the SC requires to \nsupport operations in the eclipse.\n\nFig. 4.2 Typical lithium ion cycle life vs. depth of discharge (DOD)\n\nWH (installed)=(WH used in \nEclipse)*(100/Efficiency)*(100/DOD)*(1+Margin/100)\n\nItem Quantity Units\nWH needed to operate in Eclipse 10.868 WH\nBattery Efficiency 85 %\nDepth of Discharge 10 %\nMargin 25 %\nBattery Capacity Installed 159.8 WH\n\nFig. 4.3 Computing installed battery capacity\n\nIn addition, a significant margin of battery capacity should be provided to com-\npensate for temperature degradation of battery, solar cell capacity and for mission \ncreep. These factors are reflected in the battery capacity table in Fig.\u00a04.3.\n\n4 Electric Power Subsystem Design\n\n\n\n59\n\nThis example shows that about 15 times the needed battery WH has to be provided \nto support a 10-year mission life.\n\nTo many, this may sound excessive. However, experience suggests that it is not. \nOne can never have enough battery capacity!\n\n4.2.2  Battery Choice\n\nLegacy spacecraft batteries were NiCd until about the year 2000. Sealed lead acid \nbatteries were used in some spacecraft that required battery charge and discharge at \ncold temperatures. More recently, Lithium Ion batteries have been used in space-\ncraft with good success. The table in Fig.\u00a04.4 compares the characteristics of the \ndifferent kinds of batteries used in spacecraft. The entries in this table are approxi-\nmate. Specific manufacturers\u2019 product specifications should be used since there are \nlarge variations from battery to battery, and because the state of the battery art \nchanges rapidly.\n\nBattery Types Lead Acid NiCd NiMH Li-Ion\nVoltage/Cell 2.0 1.2 1.2 3.6\nApprox No of Series Cells \nfor 28 V bus\n\n14 24 24 8\n\nDensity WH/kg 30-50 45-80 60-120 150-250\nCharge Temp C\u00b0 -20 to +50 0 to +45 0 to +45 0 to +45\nDischarge Temp C\u00b0 -20 to +50 -20 to +65 -20 to +65 -20 to +60\nSelf Discharge in (months) 3-6 1-2 2-3 years\nNotes Do Not \n\nDischarge\nto 0\n\nOK to \nDischarge\n\nOK to \nDischarge\n\nCell \nProtection \n\nNeeded\nApprox Weight of 150 WH 3.75 kg 2.5 kg 2.1 kg 0.8 kg\n\nFig. 4.4 Comparison of the characteristics of different battery types\n\nThere is a great deal of experience and data on the NiCd batteries that were used \nin spacecraft until recently. However, in the last several years, spacecraft have \nswitched to Lithium Ion batteries because of their large energy density and excellent \nlow-temperature performance. Lithium Ion batteries are recommended.\n\nSince there are large differences between different Lithium Ion batteries depend-\ning on the manufacturer, or even between different models of the same manufac-\nturer, the reader should research the cell specifications before making a selection. In \naddition, since battery capacity degrades with temperature, the installed battery \ncapacity may have to be increased to allow for aging and temperature-dependent \nloss of capacity.\n\n4.2 Battery Capacity and\u00a0Battery System Design\n\n\n\n60\n\n4.3  Solar Arrays Configuration\n\nThere are basically three types of spacecraft solar array configurations.\nIn the Body Mounted array, solar cells are mounted to a substrate to create a panel \n\nand then the panels are mounted to the spacecraft structure. This type of array con-\nfiguration is simple, but the Orbit Average Power (OAP) generated is usually only a \nsmall fraction of the installed solar cell power.\n\nIn the Deployable Panel Solar Array, power generated as a fraction of the \ninstalled power is greater, for panel angles can be adjusted to be more nearly at right \nangles to the Sun. However, these arrays are more complex because deployment and \npanel release mechanisms are required.\n\nThe Rotating (Solar Array Drive) panels optimize the use of the installed solar \ncells by continuously rotating (either about one or two axes) to orient the panels to \nmaintain normal incidence to the sun. Such panels are used when large amounts of \npower are required. Most geostationary spacecraft use such rotating panels.\n\nThe various typical spacecraft solar array configurations are shown in Fig.\u00a04.5a\u2013d. \nIn the first group are 4, 6 or 8-sided spacecraft with solar cells mounted on the sides \nof the body. Cells may also be on top.\n\nIn the next group of two spacecraft, the panels are angled at 30\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 with \nrespect to the body.\n\nIn Fig.\u00a04.5c, the long panels are tilted at 30\u00b0 (the upper half) and 45\u00b0 (the lower \nhalf). Some designers have tilted panels this way to better match the OAP require-\nments over the range of Beta during the mission.\n\nSome spacecraft are built with one-axis and others with two-axis solar array \ndrives. The two-axis solar drive permits the panels to be normal to the Sun all the \ntime, thus increasing array efficiency. However, solar array drives and deployment \nmechanism are complex and costly.\n\nThe SC with single-axis solar array drive can also point the solar panels to the \nSun most of the time. If the SC is permitted to yaw, this array configuration is very \neffective.\n\nThe Electric Power generated as a function of time in one orbit can be computed \nby stepping the spacecraft around the Earth in true anomaly (stepping the spacecraft \nposition around in its orbit one revolution). At each step, the vector from the Sun to \nthe spacecraft is computed, and then the dot product between this vector and a panel \nnormal vector is computed. The dot products are multiplied by the peak output of \neach panel and summed to get the total output power. This results in the spacecraft \npower generated as a function of true anomaly (time), The OAP can then be \ncomputed. Finally, the OAP computation for each Beta is repeated.\n\nFigure 4.6 illustrates the results of these computations for a 4-sided satellite \n(like the one shown in Fig.\u00a04.5a Type A) in a 560\u00a0km 90\u00b0 inclined orbit. The Beta \nangle varies from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. For Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 the spacecraft generates only 11% of the \npurchased and installed power.\n\n4 Electric Power Subsystem Design\n\n\n\n61\n\nFig. 4.5 (a) Several body mounted solar array configurations. (b) Solar panels tilted 30\u00b0  \nand 90\u00b0 to the body. (c) Long panels are tilted 30\u00b0 AND 45\u00b0. (d) Spacecraft with single  \n\nor dual axis solar array drives\n\n4.3 Solar Arrays Configuration\n\n\n\n62\n\nThe OAP generated for all Beta angles can be increased significantly by tilting \nthe panels, as shown in Fig.\u00a04.5b. Tilting the panels 15\u00b0 up increases the minimum \nOAP (for Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0) from 11% to 17% of the installed power. Increasing panel \nangles to 30\u00b0 raises the minimum OAP to about 22%. While further increasing \npanel tilt increases the Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 OAP, the OAP at 90\u00b0 Beta starts to decrease. \nThe 30\u00b0 panel tilt is nearly optimum if the spacecraft must operate at all Beta angles. \nAt 30\u00b0 panel tilt, the OAP is double that for body mounted panels. The OAP generated \nas a function of Beta for a 500\u00a0km Polar orbit spacecraft is shown in Fig.\u00a04.7. Panel \ntilt is shown parametrically.\n\nIn an equatorial (0\u00b0 inclination) orbit, the configuration with 90\u00b0 panel angles, \nshown in Fig.\u00a04.5b, can generate an OAP that is 33% of the installed power.\n\nAs the orbit inclination is reduced to 75\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 30\u00b0 and 0\u00b0, OAP vs. Beta \nchanges. Figure\u00a04.8 shows the minimum OAP vs. Beta for each panel inclination. \nPanel tilt of 30\u00b0 is near optimum for all inclinations until we approach the equatorial \norbit, where a 90\u00b0 tilt angle is best.\n\nNote that in a geostationary orbit, the solar panels of a nadir-pointing satellite \nwith a solar array drive can be aimed at all times to point to the Sun (except in the \neclipse), resulting in the OAP becoming 95% of the installed power.\n\nFig. 4.6 OAP as a percentage of installed power vs. Beta  \nfor polar orbit spacecraft\n\n4 Electric Power Subsystem Design\n\n\n\n63\n\nThe changes in Beta angle and inclination are illustrated in the pictures of \nFig.\u00a04.9.\n\nIn Sect. 3.6, the relationships were developed for a spreadsheet that provides the \ninstantaneous and OAP for solar panels of arbitrary orientation. Employing those rela-\ntionships, OAP for 4 configurations are shown in Fig.\u00a04.10. These are (1) 4 body mounted \npanels, (2) 4 panels tilted 30\u00b0 from the body, (3) 4 panels where half of the panels are at \n15\u00b0, the other half at 30\u00b0 and (4) where half the panels tilt 45\u00b0, the other half 60\u00b0.\n\nThe red line in Fig.\u00a04.10 shows that tilting panels 30\u00b0 increases the OAP signifi-\ncantly (relative to body mounted panels). Tilting the panels 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 further \nincreases the OAP for low Beta, but at higher Beta the OAP is less. The bottom line \nis that tilting all the panels 30\u00b0 is probably the best.\n\nFig. 4.7 OAP vs. beta for a 4-sided spacecraft at 500\u00a0km altitude and  \n90\u00b0 inclination with their solar panels tilted up by 0\u201390\u00b0\n\nOrbit Inclination \n(deg)\n\nPanel Tilt \n(deg)\n\nMin OAP vs. \nBeta\n\nAt Beta Equals \n(deg)\n\n90 30 22% of Total 0\n75 30 23% of Total 0\n60 30 23% of Total 0\n45 30 23% of Total 0\n30 45 25% of Total 90\n0 90 33% of Total Any Beta\n\nFig. 4.8 Minimum OAP as a function of panel tilt, and the beta for  \nwhich OAP is Minimum. 4 Solar Panels\n\n4.3 Solar Arrays Configuration\n\n\n\n64\n\n60\u00b0 incl\n\nBeta=0\u00b0 Beta=30\u00b0\n\nBeta=90\u00b0Beta=60\u00b0\n\nSeen from Sun\n\nFig. 4.9 Pictorial illustration of changes in beta and inclination\n\nFig. 4.10 The OAP as % of installed power for four configurations\n\n4 Electric Power Subsystem Design\n\n\n\n65\n\nFig. 4.11 Beta as a function of time in a 1-year period  \nfor a 600\u00a0km, 60\u00b0 orbit\n\n4.4  Beta Angle Vs. Time\n\nAs seen from the generated solar power\u2019s dependence on Beta, in planning a mis-\nsion, the range of Beta angles encountered in that mission should be considered. \nThe equation for Beta as a function of time, orbit inclination, launch date and hour \nis a complicated equation. It is given in the Appendix. Figure\u00a04.11, however, illus-\ntrates how Beta varied in a specific one-year period.\n\nNote that for the entire year, Beta does not exceed 80\u00b0. So, if this remains true for \nthe entire mission life of the spacecraft, a solar panel configuration that maximizes \nOAP for Beta\u00a0<\u00a080\u00b0 can be chosen. Significant savings in solar cell costs can then \nbe realized.\n\n4.5  Solar Cells and\u00a0Cell Laydown\n\nSolar cell technology is rapidly increasing the efficiency of solar cells. In the 1990s, \nGermanium cell efficiencies were only about 15%. Today, the Spectrolab Ultra \nTriple Junction Gallium Arsenide cells have efficiencies of about 28.3%. With Sun \nillumination density of 135.3\u00a0mW/cm2, a typical 40\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070\u00a0mm cell produces \nabout 1 watt output at 28\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0At maximum power, the cell voltage is 2.350 volts and \nthe cell current is 425\u00a0mA.\u00a0The bare cell weighs 84\u00a0mg/cm2, and a little bit more \nwith the cover glass.\n\nThe cell degrades a few (about 5) percent over 7\u201310\u00a0years due to radiation in space. \nThe exact amount depends on the orbit. The cell output also degrades with temperature. \nThe reader should consult the manufacturer\u2019s specifications for these degradations.\n\n4.5 Solar Cells and Cell Laydown\n\n\n\n66\n\nThe number of cells in series is dependent on the bus voltage planned for the \nspacecraft. For a legacy 28 volt spacecraft bus, typically about 14\u201318 cells in series \nare used. The solar cell \u201cstring\u201d output of 32.9\u201342.3 volts is sufficient to charge the \nbatteries with an overvoltage to accommodate the voltage drop in the charge regulator. \nThe strings are isolated from one another by diodes (see block diagram). In addition, \nwiring is typically built into the substrate in the reverse direction from the current in \nthe string to eliminate the magnetic fields that the panel would generate otherwise.\n\nGood manufacturing practice is to lay down these cells on a substrate with at \nleast 1\u00a0mm gap between cells in series. The space between \u201cstrings\u201d should be at \nleast 2\u00a0mm. A typical cell laydown on two solar panels is shown in Fig.\u00a04.12.\n\nFig. 4.12 Two panels with 3 \u201cstrings\u201d each and 9 cells per \u201cstring\u201d  \nproduces 21 volts for a 14.4 volt battery bus. Each panel produces about  \n\n27 watts of power\n\n4.6  EPS Block Diagram\n\nA typical block diagram of the Electric Power Subsystem is shown in Fig.\u00a04.13. \nSolar panel outputs are combined with blocking diodes. The current of each panel \nis monitored by the (optional) Electric Power Subsystem microprocessor and sent to \nthe ground via the telemetry transmitter.\n\n4 Electric Power Subsystem Design\n\n\n\n67\n\nEach of the multiple, series-connected string of batteries is charged by a charge \nregulator that assures that the (Lithium) cell voltages should not exceed 4.2 volts/\ncell. In a typical 28 volt bus, there are 8 series-connected battery cells. The string \nrequires 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a034.2\u00a0=\u00a033.6 volts of charging voltage, which requires solar array outputs \nof several volts more. The multiple batteries and charge regulators are connected in \nparallel. Blocking diodes from the battery strings to the main bus are used to ensure \nthat no reverse currents flow into the batteries. Individual battery voltages and \ncurrents are monitored.\n\nThe Power Distribution Unit (PDU) is powered from the battery bus. It contains \nthe various DC/DC converters required by the spacecraft electronics components. \nEach component can be switched ON/OFF as needed. Note that some DC/DC con-\nverter outputs may not be switched to ensure that they could not be turned OFF.\u00a0One \nof the 5\u00a0V DC/DC converter outputs that powers the C&DH may not be switched to \nmake sure it is never turned off (which could end the spacecraft mission).\n\nThe EPS micro-processor controls the switches, collects EPS telemetry and \ncommunicates with the spacecraft C&DH computer from which it receives com-\nmands and to which it sends EPS telemetry.\n\nThe spacecraft separation switch signals that the spacecraft and the launch vehi-\ncle have separated. This switch is often placed in series between the battery bus and \nthe PDU.\n\nIn addition, if there are battery heaters, they are turned ON/OFF by either tem-\nperature sensors mounted to the batteries or by the EPS processor.\n\nThis diagram shows only one DC/DC converter for each different voltage \nrequired by the spacecraft components. However, a more distributed architecture \nwould use multiple DC/DC converters, often one associated with each of the \nspacecraft components.\n\nAlso, this diagram shows the power switches at the outputs of the DC/DC \nconverters. Some prefer to switch the converter inputs to avoid DC/DC converter \npower drain from the batteries when components are turned OFF.\n\nFig. 4.13 Typical electric power subsystem block diagram\n\n4.6 EPS Block Diagram\n\n\n\n68\n\nThis diagram shows that each Charge Regulator charges an entire string of series- \nconnected battery cells. The cells should be matched in this design. There are charge \nregulators, however, that can charge each cell in a string separately.\n\nThe EPS design procedure was described in the foregoing. There are, of course, \nother considerations, such as the thermal design of the EPS, which are not described \nhere. Some of these EPS considerations are discussed elsewhere in this book.\n\n4 Electric Power Subsystem Design\n\n\n\n69\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_5\n\nChapter 5\nSpacecraft Communications\n\nRF communication is used to command the spacecraft from the ground, to have \nthe spacecraft send Health and Status (Telemetry) about the condition of the \nspacecraft and to send payload data to the ground station(s). This chapter dis-\ncusses spacecraft frequencies, communication link margins, Bit error rates and \nRF hardware.\n\n5.1  Frequency Allocation\n\nSatellites are only permitted to transmit and receive in allocated bands. The \nAbbreviated Table in Fig.\u00a05.1 and the detailed Table in Fig.\u00a05.2 list the frequencies \nfrom within allocations must be obtained to operate satellites by amateurs, research-\ners and commercial organizations. This Figure was extracted from the FCC Table of \nFrequency Allocations (July 28, 2016). The FCC Table enumerates further restric-\ntions that will not be discussed here.\n\nThe VHF frequencies are suitable for low data rate applications. The spacecraft \nantennas, because of their size, are usually omnidirectional (or Earth Coverage) and \nare usually fixed (not steerable). Antennas must often be stowed, because of their \ndeployed size, and released when on orbit. Since radio frequency interference on the \nground raises the ground station RF noise above the KTB noise level by more than \n10\u00a0dB, successful communication requires either sufficient spacecraft transmitter \npower or high gain ground station antennas.\n\nThe UHF frequencies are also used for low data rate applications. However, the \nspacecraft antennas are smaller (or they have more gain). Terrestrial noise, while \ngreater than KTB, is less than at VHF, and ground stations with larger antenna gains \nare smaller in size. All of these factors permit operating at higher data rates \n(typically several hundred Kbps).\n\n\n\n70\n\nFrequency Range \n(MHz)\n\nTypical Uses or users\n\n137-138 VHF Low Data Rate Satellite-to-Earth\n145-146 VHF Amateur Satellites\n148-150 VHF Uplinks to Low Data Rate Satellites\n240-270 UHF Military Satellites\n400-403 UHF Mobile Communications\n432-438 UHF Amateur Satellites\n2,025-2,300 S-Band Space-to-Earth and Earth-to-Space\n8,000-9,000 X-Band X-Band High Data Rate Satellites\nAbove 20,000 Increasingly used despite weather degradation\n\nFig. 5.1 Abbreviated list of frequencies used by spacecraft\n\n1,610.600 1,613.800 Earth-to-Space (Mobil, Aeronautical Navigation)\n1,626.500 1,660.000 Mobile Earth-to-Space\n1,660.000 1,675.000 Mobile Earth-to-Space\n1,675.000 1,695.000 Meteorological Space-to-Earth\n1,695.000 1,710.000 Meteorological Space-to-Earth\n1,761.000 1,850.000 Space Operation Earth-to-Space\n2,000.000 2,020.000 Mobile-to-Satellite Earth-to-Space\n2,025.000 2,110.000 Space Research, Earth-to-Space, Space-to-Space\n2,200.000 2,290.000 Space-to-Earth, Space-to-Space\n2,310.000 2,345.000 Broadcasting Satellite\n2,483.500 2,500.000 Space-to-Earth\n2,655.000 2,700.000 Space Research, Passive\n3,100.000 3,300.000 Earth Exploration and Space Research\n3,600.000 4,200.000 Fixed Satellite Space-to-Earth\n4,500.000 4,800.000 Fixed Satellite Space-to-Earth\n5,000.000 5,010.000 Radio Navigation Earth-to-Space\n\nFrom \n(MHz)\n\nTo \n(MHz)\n\nAllocated to\n\n7.000 7.1000 Amateur Satellite\n14.000 14.250 Amateur Satellite\n19.068 18.168 Amateur Satellite\n21.000 21.450 Amateur Satellite\n24,890 24.990 Amateur Satellite\n\n137.000 138.000 Space-to-Earth\n144.000 146.000 Amateur Satellite\n148.000 149.900 Earth-to Space\n149.900 150.050 Earth-to Space\n\n161.9625 161.9875 Earth (Mobil)-to-Space\n162.0125 162.0375 Earth (Mobil)-to-Space\n399.900 400.050 Earth-to Space\n400.150 401.000 Space-to-Earth\n401.000 402.000 Space-to-Earth and Earth-to-Space\n402.000 403.000 Earth-to Space\n\n1,164.000 1,215.000 Radio-Navigation Sat Space-to-Earth, Space-to-Space\n1,215.000 1,240,000 Radio-Navigation Sat Space-to-Earth, Space-to-Space\n1,240.000 1,300.000\n1,300.000 1,350.000 Radio-Navigation\n1,400.000 1,427.000 Earth Exploration and Satellite Research\n1,525.000 1,535.000 Space-to-Earth\n1,535.000 1,559.000 Space-to-Earth\n1,559.000 1,610.000 Radio-Navigation Sat Space-to-Earth, Space-to-Space\n\nFig. 5.2 Frequencies used by satellites (up to 20\u00a0GHz)\n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n71\n\n7,900.000 8,215.000 Earth-to-Space\n8,215.000 8,400.000 Earth Exploration Space-to-Earth, Mobile Earth-to-Space\n8,400.000 8,450.000 Deep Space Space-to-Earth\n8,450.000 8,500.000 Space Research Space-to-Earth\n8,550.000 8,650.000 Earth Exploration and Space Research\n9,300.000 9,500.000 Earth Exploration and Space Research\n\n10,600.000 10.700.000 Earth Exploration and Space Research, Passive\n10,700.000 12,200.000 Fixed Satellite Space-to-Earth\n12,200.000 12,700.000 Broadcasting Satellite\n12,700.000 13,250.000 Fixed Satellite Earth-to-Space\n13,250.000 13,750.000\n13,750.000 14,470.000 Earth-to-Space\n14,500.000 15,350.000 Space Research\n16,600.000 17,100.000 Deep Space Research Earth-to-Space\n17,200.000 17,300.000 Earth Exploration, Space Research\n17,300.000 17,700.000 Broadcasting Satellite\n17,700.000 17,800.000 Fixed Satellite Earth-to-Space\n17,800.000 20,200.000 Fixed Satellite Space-to-Earth\n\n5,010.000 5,030.000 Radio Navigation Space-to-Earth\n5,150.000 5,250.000 Fixed Satellite Earth-to-Space\n5,250.000 5,460.000 Earth Exploration, Space Research\n5,460.000 5,570.000 Earth Exploration, Space Research\n5,839.000 5,850.000 Amateur Satellite Space-to-Earth\n5,850.000 7,075.000 Fixed Satellite Earth-to-Space\n7,145.000 7,235.000 Space Research Earth-to-Space\n7,250.000 7,850.000 Fixed Satellite Space-to-Earth\n\nFig. 5.2 (continued)\n\nAt S-Band, ground noise interference is small, and high gain spacecraft antennas \nare easier to build and aim. For this reason, S-Band operations at data rates of a few \nMHz are possible.\n\nAt X-Band, all of the properties described for S-Band also apply. In addition, \nmore bandwidth is available. For this reason, data rates of tens of MHz can be \naccommodated. However, rain attenuation must be considered.\n\nAt all of these frequencies the FCC requires that the ground illumination density \nbe less than 1\u20135\u00a0mW/cm2. This effectively limits the maximum usable spacecraft \ntransmitter power and antenna gain.\n\n5.2  Modulation Types\n\nCommunications from and to a spacecraft use digital data and one of several modu-\nlation types. The most frequently used modulation types and their general charac-\nteristics are given in Fig.\u00a05.3. Modulation types are listed in the order of decreasing \nS/N ratio required for the same Bit Error Rate (BER).\n\n5.2  Modulation Types\n\n\n\n72\n\n5.3  Bit Error Rate (BER) and\u00a0Forward Error Correction \n(FEC)\n\nBefore the communication links can be designed and the required received S/N can \nbe determined, properties of the different modulation techniques must be assessed.\n\nDepending on the type of modulation chosen, there are significant differences in \nthe Signal-to-Noise ratio needed for reliable communication. This is expressed by \nthe Bit Error Rate as a function of signal bit energy per noise power density (Eb/No). \nFigure\u00a05.4 shows the BER vs Eb/No for the most often used modulation types.\n\nForward Error Correction (FEC) is often used to reduce the required Eb/No. Error \ncorrection increases the number of bits in the message to provide a way of making \nthe message less susceptible to noise or other interference. There are a large number \nof different error correction codes with different properties. Here, we will only use \nthe most frequently used Viterbi Rate 1/2, k\u00a0=\u00a07 convolutional code.\n\nApplying FEC either reduces the effective message data rate (if the bit rate is \nheld constant), or it requires increasing the bit rate and the bandwidth if the data rate \nis held constant. Thus, while using FEC has significant advantages, it also has \ndisadvantages.\n\nFigure 5.4 shows the BER vs. Eb/No for FSK, BPSK, QPSK, FSK with FEC and \nQPSK with FEC.\u00a0It is seen that introducing FEC has a significant impact on reduc-\ning the Eb/No required for a given BER.\u00a0This is best seen from the summary given \nin Fig.\u00a05.5, illustrating the Eb/No required for BERs ranging from 10?5 to 10?7.\n\nModulation Type Description Comments\nFSK (Incoherent) Carrier frequency is \n\ntoggled between 2 \nvalues\n\nHeritage modulation, \nsimple, doppler insensitive, \nModulation Index is 0.3\n\nFSK (coherent) Carrier frequency is \nchanged with\ncontinuous phase shift\n\nRequires less S/N for the \nsame BER\n\nGMSK (Gaussian \nMinimum Shift \nKeying)\n\nBinary data is first \nGaussian rounded before \napplying to FSK\n\nSimilar to FSK except the \nspectrum is more contained \n\nPSK (Phase Shift \nKeying)\n\nCarrier phase is changed \n\u00b190\u00b0\n\nImproved BER performance\n\nBPSK (Bi-Phase Shift \nKeying)\n\nCarrier is modulated by \na signal that is +1 or - 1\n\nEfficient but doppler \nsensitive\n\nQPSK (Quadrature \nPhase Shift Keying)\n\nCarrier phase is changed \nto one of four phases\n\nImproved spectral \nefficiency.

Similarly, the uplink Link Equation expresses the signal and noise \nreceived at the spacecraft receiver. Figure\u00a05.6 illustrates the link margin as a func-\ntion of spacecraft ground elevation angle. The spacecraft has a 10 watt FSK trans-\nmitter and a quarter wave Quadrifilar (Earth Coverage) antenna (see black line in \nthe figure). The spacecraft operates at S-Band (2.250\u00a0GHz) and the downlink data \n\nFig. 5.4 Bit error rate vs. Eb/No for various modulations and FEC\n\nModulation Approximate Eb/No(dB) Required forBER=10-5 BER=10-6 BER=10-7\nFSK (incoherent) 13.2 14.2 14.8\nBPSK or QPSK 9.8 10.6 11.7\nFSK with FEC* 7.8 9.0 9.6\n\nQPSK with FEC* 4.5 5.6 5.9\n* FEC is Viterbi Rate 1/2 with k=7\n\nFig. 5.5 Summary of Eb/No requirements for  \ndifferent modulations and BER\n\n5.4  Link Equations\n\n\n\n74\n\nFig. 5.6 S-Band downlink margin example\n\nrate is 1 Mbps. No FEC is used. The ground station has a 2.4 meter antenna of 3.9\u00b0 \nbeamwidth. The ground station receiver noise figure (NF) is 3\u00a0dB.\u00a0In addition, a \n3\u00a0dB implementation loss at the receiver is assumed. To operate at a BER of 10?7, \nthe Eb/No should exceed 15\u00a0dB.\u00a0The minimum required Eb/No of +15\u00a0dB is included \nin the graph plotted in Fig.\u00a05.6. The Link Equations are shown under Fig.\u00a05.6.\n\nIt is seen that the satellite can close the Space-to-Earth link at ground elevation \nangles greater than ?12\u00b0, and it has excess Eb/No at higher elevation angles. If Rate \n1/2, k\u00a0=\u00a07 FEC were used, link performance would improve by 5.2\u00a0dB (see Fig.\u00a05.5), \nand the spacecraft could close the downlink at the horizon.\n\nThe downloadable software contains a detailed Link Margin as a function of \nOrbit Altitude, Ground Elevation angle from the ground observer to the spacecraft \nand all of the other variables already described (Fig. 5.7).\n\n \n\nS Received Signal Strength at Gnd Rcvr P AG ML SL AG PL\n\nS\nGR T SC GS= = + ? ? + ?\n\nRRequired KTB noise GN NF NBW IL Eb No R\n\nSL 3 8 20\n\n= + + + + + ( )\n= + ?\n\n/ ,\n\n.\n\n where\n\n7 LLOG Freq MHz 20 LOG Slant Range\n\nKTB 1 dBm Hz\n\nLin\n\n?( ) + ( )\n= ?\n\n?\n\nand noise 74 /\n\nkk Margin S SGS Required= ? in dB and where :  \n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n75\n\nPT\u00a0=\u00a0Spacecraft Transmitter Power in dBm\nAGSC\u00a0=\u00a0Spacecraft Antenna Gain in the direction of the Ground Station in dBic\nSL\u00a0=\u00a0Space Loss (varies inversely with the square of the slant range to the\nGround Station) in dB\nAGGS\u00a0=\u00a0Ground Station Antenna Gain in dBic\nML\u00a0=\u00a0Modulation Loss in dB\nPL\u00a0=\u00a0Ground Station Antenna Pointing Loss in dB\nSGR\u00a0=\u00a0Ground Receiver Input Signal in dBm\nNF\u00a0=\u00a0Ground Receiver Noise Figure in dB\nNBW\u00a0=\u00a0Ground Station Receiver Noise Bandwidth in dB/Hz\nKTB\u00a0=\u00a0KTB noise in dBm\nGN\u00a0=\u00a0Ground Noise in excess of KTB noise in dB\nIL\u00a0=\u00a0Implementation Loss in dB\nEb/No R\u00a0=\u00a0Required Eb/No taking into account modulation, BER requirements and \n\nFEC in dB\nSRequired\u00a0=\u00a0Signal Strength Required at the Ground Receiver in dBm\n\nQuantity Description Values for \nExample in\nFigure 7.6\n\nPT Spacecraft Transmitter Power 40.00 dBm\n\nAGSC\nSpacecraft Antenna Gain in the direction of the \nGround Station\n\n-1.45 dBm\n\nML Modulation Loss -0.50 dB\n\nSL Space Loss (from 600 km altitude spacecraft to Ground at 15\u00b0 Elevation)\n-163.70 dB\n\nAGGS Ground Station Antenna Gain 32.04 dB\nPL Ground Station Antenna Pointing Loss 0.00 dB\n\nSGS\nReceived Signal Strength at the Ground Station \nReceiver Input\n\n- 93.11 \ndBm\n\nNF Ground Receiver Noise Figure 3.00 dB\nNBW Grnd Station Receiver Noise Bandwidth (for 1 Mbps \n\nData Rate)\n60.79 dB\n\nKTB KTB Noise Density (per Hz) -174.00 \ndBm\n\nGN Ground Noise in Excess of KTB noise 0.00 dB\nIL Implementation Loss 2.00 dB\n\nEb/No R Required Eb/No (for FSK, no FEC, BER=10-7) 15.00 dB\n\nSRequired\nRequired Signal Strength at Grnd Rcv Input to \nclose the link\n\n-93.21 dBm\n\nLink Margin 0.10 dB\n\nFig. 5.7 Link margin example\n\nIf FEC were employed, the Link margin would increase to 5.3\u00a0dB; and that would \nenable closing the link at the horizon with 10?7 BER.\n\nUsing QPSK with FEC would increase the link margin by about 8.9\u00a0dB.\u00a0This excess \nmargin could be used to close the link at the horizon (using up 4.8\u00a0dB) AND increasing \nthe data rate to 2 Mbps.\n\nAdditional improvements would have to be achieved mostly by increasing the \nspacecraft antenna gain.\n\n5.4  Link Equations\n\n\n\n76\n\n5.5  Spacecraft Antennas\n\nThe most frequently used antennas on LEO spacecraft are:\n\n\u2022 N-Turn Helix\n\u2022 1/2 wave Quadrifilar Helix\n\u2022 Full wave Quadrifilar Helix\n\u2022 Patch\n\u2022 Horn (at microwaves)\n\u2022 Dish (mostly at microwaves)\n\n5.5.1  The N-Turn Helix Antenna\n\nHelix antennas are very popular for spacecraft use, and they can achieve gains up to \nabout 15\u00a0dB.\u00a0The antenna can also be pressed flat (like a bedspring) so that in the \nstowed configuration it occupies little space. When on orbit, the turns of the antenna \nare released to let the helix deploy to its design length. Flexible lines tied between \nconsecutive turns ensure that the deployed antenna has its design length.\n\nDifferent references provide different values of antenna gain for a given numbers \nof turns. The Table in Fig.\u00a05.8 uses conservative values. This author has used 2.5 and \n5-turn helixes on several spacecraft. The antenna gain for the 2.5 turn helix was \nabout 5.5\u00a0dB.\n\nHelix Antenna Characteristics\nFrequency f 2.250 GHz\nLambda 30/f(GHz) 13.333 cm\nSpace Between Turns 0.22169*? 2.960 cm\nPitch 12.5\u00b0 12.5 degree\nDiameter ?/? 4.24 cm\nGround Plane Diameter 0.8*? 10.66 cm\nTurns Gain \n\n(dBic)\n3 dB BW \n\n(\u00b0)\nAnt Length\n\n(cm)\nGrnd Plane\n\nDia (cm)\nDiameter\n\n(cm)\n1 3.76 110 2.96 10.66 4.244\n2 6.77 78 5.91 10.66 4.244\n3 8.53 64 8.87 10.66 4.244\n4 9.78 55 11.82 10.66 4.244\n5 10.75 49 14.78 10.66 4.244\n6 11.54 45 17.74 10.66 4.244\n7 12.21 42 20.69 10.66 4.244\n8 12.79 39 23.65 10.66 4.244\n9 13.30 37 26.60 10.66 4.244\n10 13.76 35 29.56 10.66 4.244\n\nFig. 5.8 N-Turn Helix antenna gain, beamwidth and length\n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n77\n\n5.5.2  Half Wave Quadrifilar Helix Antenna\n\nQuadrifilar antennas were first developed in the 1970\u2019s. The half wave antenna \nshown in Fig.\u00a05.9 has a 1\u00a0GHz bandwidth and a peak antenna gain of about 4\u00a0dB.\u00a0It \nprovides Earth Coverage from LEO.\n\nFig. 5.9 (a) 0.75?

This is the angle of the \nhorizon from about 600\u00a0km. In addition, the antenna gain is reduced at nadir, better \nmatching the slant range path loss. The antenna pattern of a full wave Quadrifilar antenna \nis shown in Fig.\u00a05.9b. The link margin vs elevation angle for the same conditions as in \nFig.\u00a05.6, except for substituting the full wave quadrifilar, is shown in Fig.\u00a05.10.\n\n5.5.3  The Turnstile Antenna\n\nThis type antenna is well-suited to provide Circularly Polarized Earth Coverage for \nspacecraft below about 800\u00a0km. The antenna is small (at S-band, about 2?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02?) and \nrigid. It easily withstands launch vehicle loads (Fig.\u00a05.11).\n\n5.5.4  The Patch Antenna\n\nFor higher gains, a circularly polarized Patch Antenna can be used. This is a rectan-\ngular, flat antenna that can be built with gains ranging from about 3\u00a0dB to in excess \nof 15\u00a0 dB.\u00a0 A commercial 2.4\u00a0 GHz patch antenna of 8 dBic gain is typically \n11.4\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a011.4\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.3\u00a0cm.\n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n79\n\nAnother patch antenna, designed to provide telemetry from a satellite at S-Band \n(2.2\u20132.3\u00a0 GHz), had to provide Earth Coverage so the Ground Station could be \naccessed any time the spacecraft was in the Field Of View (FOV) of the ground \n station. This antenna was 1.9 in\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.9 in\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.050\u00a0in and had the antenna gain, shown \nin Fig.\u00a05.12. Note that the Earth Horizon is about 30\u00b0 down from the spacecraft. The \nantenna has 0 dBic gain at the horizon, and reaches 4\u00a0dB gain toward nadir.\n\n5.5.5  Horn Antennas\n\nAt microwave frequencies, a horn antenna can provide medium-to-high antenna \ngain. At X-Band stock horns are readily available with 10\u00a0dB, 15\u00a0dB and 20\u00a0dB \ngains. A typical 10\u00a0dB (linearly polarized) horn is shown in Fig.\u00a05.13. It also shows \nthe physical characteristics of a 15\u00a0dB horn.\n\nFig. 5.11 Turnstile antenna (courtesy SpaceQuest)\n\nFig. 5.12 Low gain earth coverage patch antenna\n\n5.5  Spacecraft Antennas\n\n\n\n80\n\nFig. 5.13 X-Band horn antennas\n\n5.5.6  Dish Antennas\n\nFor higher gains dish antennas are used. The gain of a parabolic dish of diameter D \nand its beamwidth are given below (Fig. 5.14):\n\n \nGain 10 k BW 70 D\n\n2\n= ( )( ) =? ?log / deg) /? ? ?\n\n \n(5.1)\n\nFig. 5.14 Dish antenna gains and beamwidths at 2.2GHz and 8\u00a0GHz\n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n81\n\n5.5.7  Intersatellite Links and\u00a0Steerable Antennas\n\nThere are some spacecraft applications that require very high gain antennas. For \nexample, an intersatellite link at 23.2\u00a0GHz, if it is to communicate with another \nsatellite at 3500\u00a0km distance at 25 Mbps bit rate, requires a spacecraft antenna gain \nof about 30 dBic. Such an antenna has a beamwidth of about 5.3\u00b0. This presents a \ndifficult problem of acquiring the other satellite and to keep the antenna pointing to \nit during a rapidly changing geometrical environment. Typically, such antennas are \nmechanically pointed. However, the angular momentum and CG changes of the \nantenna during steering must be taken into account by the spacecraft attitude control \nsystem, for both of these will affect spacecraft attitude.\n\nTwo examples of mechanically steered microwave antennas (both from Surrey \nSatellite Technology) are shown in Fig.\u00a05.15. The one on the left is a 19\u00a0dB 8\u00a0GHz \nantenna, while the one on the right is a steerable dish antenna. These antennas are \ntypically used to communicate from spacecraft to a ground station, and are used to \ntrack the ground station during the satellite pass.\n\nFig. 5.15 Mechanically steered microwave antennas  \n(Surrey Satellite Technology)\n\n5.5  Spacecraft Antennas\n\n\n\n82\n\n5.5.8  Phased Arrays\n\nPhased array antennas can be steered rapidly and can exhibit moderate gains. \nSteering is usually restricted to about \u00b145\u00b0 in elevation and azimuth. The array of \nelements that comprise the antenna operate at low power and are phase shifted digi-\ntally. The main advantage of such antennas is their ability to switch antenna direc-\ntion very rapidly and to serve as a multibeam antenna. The main disadvantage, from \na spacecraft point of view, is that the phase shifters draw a lot of power. In small \nspacecraft, this power requirement may prohibit the use of phased arrays.\n\n5.5.9  Deployable Antennas\n\nIn most larger spacecraft where very large antennas are needed, the antennas are \ndeployable. Examples of deployable antennas are shown in Fig.\u00a05.16 (ATS-6 and \nthe 2-meter APL Hybrid Inflatable Reflector).\n\nFig. 5.16 Pictures of deployable antennas\n\n5.6  Increasing Throughput by\u00a0Varying Bit Rate or Switching \nAntennas\n\nIt was shown in Fig.\u00a05.10 that a link margin of 0\u00a0dB limited the data rate to 1 Mbps. \nHowever, Eb/No reached 10\u00a0dB for higher elevation angles before it dropped to about \n6\u00a0dB at Nadir. The data rate could have been increased to take advantage of the exces-\nsive link margin at higher elevation angles. For example, after 10\u00b0 elevation, the data \nrate could have been increased to 2 Mbps, and after about 17\u00b0 the rate could have \nbeen increased to 4 Mbps. While the majority of time is spent at low elevation angles, \nvarying the data rate during the pass can substantially increase the throughput.\n\nAnother approach to increasing the throughput is to use (in addition to the Nadir \npointing Quadrifilar antenna) two high gain antennas pointing in the horizontal direc-\n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n83\n\ntion fore and aft. The maximum gains that such antennas could have are plotted in \nFig.\u00a05.17. If 6-turn Helix antennas of 11.54\u00a0dB peak gains were used, the link equa-\ntion would change, shown in Fig.\u00a05.18, and 4 Mbps could be used for the entire pass.\n\nFig. 5.17 Maximum gain of horizontally aimed antennas to increase  \nlink margin at low elevations\n\nFig. 5.18 Switching antennas during the pass could increase the data rate to 4 Mbps\n\n5.6  Increasing Throughput by\u00a0Varying Bit Rate or Switching Antennas\n\n\n\n84\n\n5.7  Geometrical Constraints on\u00a0Space-to-Ground \nCommunication\n\nThe relatively short duration of a pass of a LEO spacecraft over a ground station, \nand the low maximum antenna gains for Earth coverage severely limit the amount \nof data that can be downlinked from a spacecraft during a pass. Figure\u00a05.19 illus-\ntrates the duration of a pass from a 600\u00a0km orbit altitude spacecraft to a groundsta-\ntion at various CPA distances from the ground trace of the spacecraft.\n\nAs the Spacecraft Ground Trace CPA to the Ground Station increases, pass \ndurations get shorter, and the maximum elevation angles become lower. At a 500\u00a0km \nCPA and an elevation angle above 20\u00b0, for example, the pass is only about 5\u00a0min \nlong.\n\nWith an Earth Coverage spacecraft antenna and a large (2.4 meter) ground sta-\ntion dish antenna operating at 1 Mbps data rate, the maximum amount of data that \ncan be downlinked in a pass is about 300 Mbits or 37.5 MBytes. At greater CPA \ndistances, the amount of data that can be downlinked is even less. This severely \nlimits how LEO satellites can be used for large data dumps.\n\nFig. 5.19 Elevation angle vs. Ground range and pass durations in  \ncommunicating to a ground station at a given CPA  \n\nfrom the satellite ground trace\n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n85\n\nA steerable spacecraft antenna that tracks the ground station can provide a large \nenough antenna gain to increase the amount of data that can be downlinked to 10 \ntimes more than an Earth coverage spacecraft antenna.\n\nA spacecraft orbits the Earth about 15 times a day, but it can access a given \nground station only about 5 times a day. Therefore, the total amount of data a spacecraft \ncan downlink to a given ground station per day is about 1.5 Gbits. With steerable \nantennas, this number can increase 10 fold or even more.\n\nOther methods of increasing a spacecraft\u2019s ability to downlink large amounts of \ndata are (a) use multiple ground stations, (b) use ground stations at high latitude \nwhere the number of orbits visible per day is larger\u00a0- at least for highly inclined \norbits and (c) use a geostationary relay satellite.\n\n5.8  RF Subsystem Block Diagram\n\nA typical LEO spacecraft RF subsystem is shown in Fig.\u00a05.20. It is assumed that \npacketization, randomization to balance the data stream for 0\u00a0 DC component, \nForward Error Correction and Encryption are performed either in digital hardware \nor software in the C&DH computer. The data stream ready for transmission enters \nthe S-Band 10 watt transmitter where it is QPSK modulated. The data may be \ntelemetry (TTM) or payload data.\n\nThe design employs a nadir looking main antenna and an anti-nadir looking \nsecondary antenna to assure that TTM could be sent to the ground even if the spacecraft \nsuffered an attitude control anomaly, or if the spacecraft has just been released from \n\nFig. 5.20 Typical LEO spacecraft RF subsystem\n\n5.8  RF Subsystem Block Diagram\n\n\n\n86\n\nthe Launch Vehicle and is tumbling. Since the data rate of TTM is very small com-\npared to the data rate of the main mission payload, a power splitter is used to dump \nmost of the power into the main antenna, and only a small amount of power is fed \nto the anti-nadir patch antenna. In this example, 1 Mbps data is fed to the main \nantenna and the TTM is only 9.6\u00a0kbps. Therefore, when the spacecraft is inverted, \nTTM transmissions reach the ground with the same power density as the main data \nwhen the spacecraft is nadir pointing.\n\nThe same procedure is used to receive the CMD uplink transmissions. Since the \nground station is assumed to have a powerful transmitter, and since the command \nuplink is at a low data rate, the spacecraft received signal is strong even if the \nspacecraft is upside down.\n\n5 Spacecraft Communications\n\n\n\n87\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

Thus, these are no longer major factors in the selection process. However, \nradiation hardness, sensitivity to SEU, power consumption and I/O capabilities are \nstill properties that influence the choice of digital processors. A list of factors that \nshould be taken into consideration is given below:\n\n\u2022 Architecture (one central or a distributed set of computers)\n\u2022 Software Operating System\n\u2022 Instruction Set\n\u2022 Number of Bits Per Word\n\u2022 I/O Capability\n\u2022 Rad Hardness\n\u2022 Reliability\n\u2022 Redundancy\n\u2022 Memory Size\n\u2022 Speed\n\u2022 Cost\n\u2022 Weight\n\u2022 Power Consumption\n\n6.1  Computer Architecture\n\nThe space community is divided between a single, centralized processor performing \nmost of the functions versus several small, low power consumption processors \n(associated with the spacecraft subsystems) in a distributed architecture. The com-\nmunity is also divided between those who like to use the many high technology, low \ncost COTS processors of low RAD hardness versus the very expensive RAD hard \n\n\n\n88\n\nprocessors, usually lagging in technology and speed behind the COTS processors. \nThe trend is toward the use of a distributed computer architecture.\n\nAdvantages of the decentralized, distributed computer architecture are:\n\n\u2022 Less capable computers can be used to command, handle and receive informa-\ntion from a single subsystem than from all the subsystems of a spacecraft\n\n\u2022 Computer speed requirements are reduced\n\u2022 Fewer I/O channels are needed in each computer\n\u2022 Power consumption is usually less\n\u2022 There is inherent redundancy in a distributed system (one computer malfunction \n\nmay not take down the entire spacecraft)\n\u2022 It is easier to integrate all spacecraft software (written by multiple people) if each \n\nperson only writes for one computer\n\u2022 A distributed system is often much less expensive\n\nAn example of a distributed digital architecture is shown in Fig.\u00a06.1 for a com-\nplex spacecraft with a main mission of imaging selected targets on Earth. This \nspacecraft has four computers. The C&DH is mostly concerned with housekeeping \nand communication functions. It requires a large memory.

The image processor is also a high \nspeed processor and requires a large memory. The communications processor (if \nseparate from the C&DH computer) is of modest speed and requires little memory. \nInterconnections between computers are not shown.\n\n6.2  Computer Characteristics and\u00a0Selection\n\nThe requirements for each of the multiple computers of the spacecraft should be \ndetermined from mission and cost considerations. The RAD hardness, speed, amount \nof memory, the number of analog and digital I/O channels, power consumption, \nweight and cost are the most important characteristics on which a selection is based.\n\nIn spacecraft weighing under 150 lbs, low power consumption is more important \nthan in larger spacecraft. Single board computers for small spacecraft typically con-\nsume 1\u20133 watts, and that power consumption can be reduced further by operating \nthe computer at lower clock speeds when it is not needed. Large concentrated RAD \nhard computers typically consume 30\u201340 or more watts, an amount a small space-\ncraft cannot afford.\n\nThe I/O capability is another major consideration. A small spacecraft may need \nto access about 30\u201340 points to collect TTM data. In a larger spacecraft, this number \nmay be 100 or more. If a distributed architecture is used, any one computer may \nonly be required to access less than 20 points. This not only reduces I/O require-\nments, but it also reduces the required speed.\n\nMemory size used to be a big issue, but in recent years, memories have gotten \nlarger and cheaper. However, SEU sensitivity and RAD hardness are still big issues.\n\nSingle board computers typically weigh about 0.5\u20131.0 lbs, while larger central \ncomputers can weigh as much as about 20 lbs.\n\nThe form factor ranges from the PC/104 (3.6?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05?) to much larger sizes.\nCOTS for Single Board Computers range from about $10\u00a0K, while larger RAD \n\nhard machines cost several hundred thousands of dollars.\nSo, while it seems that selecting a set of computers for a spacecraft would be a \n\nchallenging task, in reality it is much easier when one lists the main features and \ncompares different machines in terms of those features.\n\nCost is most often the deciding factor, as long as radiation and SEU characteris-\ntics can be managed to provide the required mission life.\n\n6.3  Spacecraft Computers Available Today\n\nIt must be recognized that COTS computer state-of-the-art is changing rapidly, and \nany set of choices would be obsolete in a year or two. The space computer state-of- \nthe-art is changing much more slowly, but even here, specific recommendations will \nbecome obsolete in a few years.\n\n6.3 Spacecraft Computers Available Today\n\n\n\n90\n\nNevertheless, it is worthwhile to list some of today\u2019s space computers. The list \nbelow is but a small fraction of space computers available today.\n\nSpace Micro manufactures a set of radiation and SEU tolerant single board space \ncomputers. They are the Proton 200\u00a0k, the Proton 300\u00a0k and the Proton 400\u00a0k. They \nweigh about 0.5 lbs, consume about 1.5 watts and are PC-104 size. Each is modestly \nrad hard and SEU insensitive. Their costs are at the low end of the scale.\n\nSurrey Satellite Technology (UK) also manufactures a very capable single board \n5\u00a0k Rad Hard computer. It weighs less than 3.3 lbs and consumes less than 10 watts. \nIt is more expensive.\n\nSynova, Inc. manufactures the Mongoose-V 32-bit radiation-hardened space-\ncraft computer. It is packaged in a 256-pin ceramic flatpack.\n\n6 Spacecraft Digital Hardware\n\n\n\n91\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

Over- \nspecifying ADACS performance requirements can easily \u201cbust the budget.\u201d A com-\nmon mistake is to call for more stringent accuracy than is required by the payload. \nFor example, if the mission is to simply scan the atmospheric spectrum from the \nNorthern Hemisphere, then pointing much more than 5\u00b0 is hardly required. \nSpecifying pointing accuracy 1 or 2 orders of magnitude better rapidly leads to \nexpensive equipment, such as star trackers, when a simple momentum-biased sys-\ntem with Earth sensors would suffice.\n\nThis chapter describes ADACS development beginning with the process of flow-\ning down requirements from mission to system and component level requirements \nwith the added objective of minimizing cost while providing adequate performance. \nNext, different types of attitude control system configurations and their accuracies \nand suitability to various missions are described. Finally, the processes of on-orbit \ncheckout, operations and anomaly resolution are addressed.\n\n7.1  ADACS Performance Requirements Flowdown\n\nThe first step is to evaluate mission pointing accuracy requirements. How accurately \ndoes the payload need to point to a target on the Earth or in space? Are there any \nmaneuvering requirements (that is, how far and how fast)? The simplest lowest cost \nand most reliable solution is nearly always that which yields the lowest performance \nacceptable to the mission. Following are some representative examples.\n\nIf the mission is space-to-ground two-way communications, attitude accuracy of \n0.2 times the antenna beamwidth is usually sufficient. Since Earth Coverage anten-\nnas typically have beamwidths of about 100\u00b0, attitude control can be as poor as 20\u00b0. \nThis is readily achieved by a gravity gradient stabilization system.\n\n\n\n92\n\nIf spacecraft-to-spacecraft communications is employed, the spacecraft-to- \nspacecraft antenna beamwidth is quite narrow, but pointing accuracy probably does \nnot have to be better than about 2\u00b0. This can readily be achieved with a Pitch Bias \nMomentum stabilization system.\n\nIf the pointing accuracy required by the mission is to point a camera to the ground \nwith an accuracy of 60\u00a0m (at nadir) from an altitude of 600\u00a0km, then the pointing \naccuracy needs to be 0.0001 radians (0.00573\u00b0), and attitude sensing capability \nneeds to be twice as good, 0.002865\u00b0 or 10.25 arc-sec. This results in a very expen-\nsive ADACS and requires a 3-axis zero momentum stabilization system with 3 reac-\ntion wheels and two star trackers. Because of the cost involved, one must be sure \nthat 60 meter pointing accuracy on the ground is really required.\n\nAnother factor that drives the cost and choice of the ADACS is the agility with \nwhich a spacecraft must be able to change attitude. The more agility is required, the \nlarger the torque the ADACS must be able to impart to the spacecraft.\n\nThe lowest cost, most reliable system usually results by considering the mini-\nmum performance required to fulfill mission requirements. The challenge is know-\ning what the simplest configuration is that can meet the requirements of the \npayload.\n\nMost missions are either Earth or inertial-pointing. Earth-pointing missions \npoint a payload at, or offset from, the subsatellite point, requiring the spacecraft to \nrotate at or near the orbit rate. Inertial-pointing missions point the payload at the \nSun or other target fixed in position with respect to the stars. Either kind of mission \ncan have various agility requirements.\n\nMany of the Earth or inertial-pointing missions can be satisfied by a single \nmomentum wheel or even an all magnetic spinning system. Such systems have \ndemonstrated performance of about 1\u00b0 in roll and pitch and 3\u00b0 in yaw. They are \ngenerally inertially fixed or have only limited mobility about the momentum bias \naxis.\n\nAnother class of missions have low (5\u00b0 or greater) Earth-pointing requirements. \nThis accuracy can sometimes be achieved by an all passive system, consisting of a \ngravity gradient boom and magnetic hysteresis rods. Because the gravity vector is \nused to orient the spacecraft, this solution is only for nadir pointing.\n\nThe highest performance category involves use of 3 orthogonal reaction wheels \noperated with little or no bias speed, termed a 3-axis zero momentum system. \nSpacecraft attitude can be controlled with excellent accuracy (0.01\u00b0 or better), \naccommodating payloads with stringent pointing requirements. One or more star \ntrackers are generally required to sense such small attitude errors. This is the most \ncostly ADACS system.\n\nMission requirements must flow down to specify the minimum pointing accu-\nracy and spacecraft agility. The table shown in Fig.\u00a07.1 summarizes ADACS require-\nments for various types of missions\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n93\n\n7.2  Description of\u00a0the\u00a0Most Common ADACS Systems\n\n7.2.1  Gravity Gradient Stabilization\n\nThe simplest method of stabilizing a spacecraft so it would be nadir-pointing is by \ngravity gradient stabilization, shown in Fig.\u00a0 7.2. This is a completely passive \nmethod, requiring no electric power. Here, a Tip Mass of weight WT is placed at the \nend of a boom of length, L, protruding from the spacecraft of weight WSC. Hysteresis \nrods at the tip mass damp the oscillations. Nadir-pointing accuracy of 5\u201310\u00b0 peak \nswing can be achieved in pitch and roll, but not in yaw.\n\nSince the acceleration of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the \ndistance from the center of the Earth to the spacecraft altitude, there will be a  gravity \n\nMission Pointing \nRequirement\n\nManeuver ADACS\nType\n\nEquipment Relative \nCost\n\nRam \nPointing\n\n3\u00b0 into Ram None Aerodynamic \nat Altitudes \n\nBelow \n~300km \n\nOnly.\n\nTail Feathers, \nOptional Pitch \n\nBias Wheel \nand Torque \nRods with \n\nMagnetometer\n\nLow\n\nNadir \nPointing\n\n>3\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 None Gravity \nGradient\n\nGravity \nGradient \nBoom, \n\nHysteresis \nRods, No \nAttitude \nSensing\n\nLow\n\nNadir or \nSingle \nAxis \n\nInertial \nPointing\n\n1\u00b0 0 to 1\u00b0 per \nday\n\nMagnetic \nSpinner\n\nTorque Rods, \nMagnetometer, \nOptional Earth \nor Sun Sensors\n\nLow\n\nNadir \nPointing\n\n1\u00b0 Track Sub-\nsatellite \nPoint to \n\nSlight Pitch \nAxis \n\nExcursions\n\nPitch \nMomentum \n\nBias\n\nSingle \nReaction \n\nWheel, Torque \nRods, \n\nMagnetometer \nEarth Sensor, \nOptional Sun \n\nsensor\n\nMedium\n\n3-axis \nStabilized \nEarth or \nInertial \nPointing\n\n< 0.1\u00b0 None to \nHighly \nAgile\n\n3-axis zero \nMomentum\n\n3 Reaction \nWheels, \n\nTorque Rods, \nStar \n\nTracker(s), \nMagnetometer\n\nHigh\n\nFig. 7.1 Stabilization approaches for various missions\n\n7.2  Description of\u00a0the\u00a0Most Common ADACS Systems\n\n\n\n94\n\ngradient between the tip mass and the spacecraft that will cause the mechanical \nsystem to act like a pendulum and oscillate. The thermal energy generated by the \nhysteresis rods cutting the Earth magnetic field is used to dissipate the pendulum \noscillation energy and damp the magnitude of oscillations.\n\nThe acceleration of gravity at an altitude H km is given by Eq.\u00a07.1, the gravity \ngradient by Eq.\u00a07.2, the restoring torque at ?\u00b0 deflection by Eq.\u00a07.3 and the fre-\nquency of oscillation by Eq.\u00a07.4.

These are illustrated in Fig.\u00a07.3 for a 600\u00a0km altitude spacecraft.\n\nSince a gravity gradient stabilized spacecraft has two stable states (right side up \nand upside down), it is possible that when first achieving a stable orientation, the \nspacecraft will be upside down. Employing the Z-coil against the Earth magnetic \nfield in the Polar region can be used to flip the spacecraft so it becomes stable in the \nright side up orientation.\n\nWT\n\nL*WT/(WT+WSC)\n\nL\n\nHysteresis\nRods\n\nFig. 7.2 Gravity gradient stabilization\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n95\n\nOscillations are damped out usually by hysteresis rods that dissipate some of the \nenergy due to oscillation by converting oscillatory energy to heat. \u201cFat\u201d hysteresis \nloop soft iron rods at right angles to the orbit plane are typically used in a passive \ndamping system.\n\n7.2.2  Pitch Bias Momentum Stabilization\n\nPitch bias momentum stabilization, shown in Fig.\u00a0 7.4, provides excellent nadir- \npointing stability in Roll, Pitch and Yaw at the cost of one reaction wheel, 3-axis \ntorque rods, a magnetometer, and Earth horizon sensor(s).\n\nSC Weight \n(lbs)\n\nTip Weight \n(lbs)\n\nBoom \nLength (ft)\n\nPeriod \n(min)=1/fo\n\nRestoring \n?(10\u00b0)\n\n200 5 20 47.732 3.98*10-5 ft-lbs\n200 10 20 58.281 7.77*10-5 ft-lbs\n400 10 50 91.874 2.95*10-4 ft-lbs\n\n10 1 10 65.161 3.71*10-6 ft-lbs\n10 1 20 92.152 7.41*10-6 ft-lbs\n\nFig. 7.3 Different spacecraft and tip mass weights and periods of oscillation, restoring force\n\nIw\n\nISC\nw\n\nFig. 7.4 Pitch bias momentum stabilization\n\nThe reaction wheel is aligned with the spacecraft pitch axis and turns with an angu-\nlar velocity of ?. The wheel has a moment of inertia of IW while that of the spacecraft \nis ISC. Earth horizon sensor(s) (EHS) determine spacecraft attitude in pitch in a narrow \nrange (where the spacecraft is nearly nadir-pointing). Magnetic torque rods interact \nwith the secular magnetic field to provide damping and precession torques. A magne-\ntometer senses the phase angle of the torque rods with respect to the secular field.\n\nThe reaction wheel serves two functions. It provides gyroscopic stiffness to \nallow the spacecraft to retain attitude when the magnetic field is not favorably \n\n7.2  Description of\u00a0the\u00a0Most Common ADACS Systems\n\n\n\n96\n\naligned, and it facilitates a high bandwidth loop in pitch. By conservation of angular \nmomentum, when the reaction wheel speed increases, spacecraft pitch angular \nvelocity decreases in the ratio of IW/ISC. Thus, the pitch attitude of the spacecraft can \nbe adjusted by speeding up or slowing down the reaction wheel in response to \nchanges in the angular position of the Earth horizon.\n\nThe gyroscopic stiffness of the spinning wheel provides inertial stability. When \ninitially deployed, simple \u2013B dot rate damping (turning the torque rods ON, out of \nphase with the sensed magnetic field to remove kinetic energy from the body) will \ndrive the momentum bias vector to the negative orbit normal (the minimum energy \nstate) where pitch can be captured by the EHS.\n\nSubsequently, continuously damping nutation with the torque rods and serving to \nnull pitch error with the reaction wheel will drive the Z axis to nadir. Quarter orbit \ncoupling through gyroscopic stiffness will keep yaw error small also. Typical errors \nare 1\u00b0 in roll and pitch and 3\u00b0 in yaw.\n\nIt is recommended by GSFC that the reaction wheel angular momentum be about \n10 times that of the spacecraft due to orbital rate. When the spacecraft is nadir- pointing \nit rotates at P/360/60\u00a0=\u00a0P*2.773*10?5 degrees/s, where P is the orbit period in minutes. \nExpressing the nadir-pointing spacecraft angular velocity in terms of its altitude, H, \nEq.\u00a07.5 is obtained. The reaction wheel angular velocity is given in Eq.\u00a07.6.\n\n \n?SC\n\n9 1 57 68 10 R Hdeg/ sec . and in\n.( ) = +( )? ? ? where R H are km  (7.5)\n\n \n?W SC WRPM I I( ) = ?0 16589. /  (7.6)\n\nNumerical examples will help to get a \u201cfeel\u201d for the important parameters of \nwheel speed and inertia. The spacecraft in this example weighs 200 lbs. and is a \nrectangular prism with 24 inches square base and 28 inches height. The Reaction \nWheel has diameter of DW inches and is TW inch thick. It is made of steel of 0.270 \nlbs./cu in density. Orbit altitude is 600\u00a0km or 800\u00a0km. From Fig.\u00a07.5, it is seen that \nthe reaction wheel speed is in a reasonable range although the wheel is quite large.\n\nThe horizon sensor can be a horizon scanner where a rotating beam shines the \nincident energy onto a detector. When the rotating beam intersects the Earth hori-\nzon, the IR radiation-induced pulse indicates the angular span of the Earth pulse. \nThe bisector of this pulse indicates the direction to nadir.\n\nAlternatively, a linear array of static IR sensors spread out in the pitch direction \ncan be used to look at the Earth limb. The specific sensors at the boundary of the \nhigh and low IR radiation indicate the angular position of the Earth limb. From this, \nthe nadir angle can be computed. Earth horizon sensor accuracies are typically a \nfraction of a degree.\n\nSC Weight \n(lbs)\n\nAltitude \n(km)\n\nISC\n(slug-ft2)\n\nDW\n(in)\n\nTW\n(in)\n\nIW\n(slug-ft2)\n\n?W\n(RPM)\n\n200 600 3.004 10.0 1.5 0.051418 2,175\n200 800 3.004 10.0 1.5 0.051418 2,085\n\nFig. 7.5 Reaction wheel speed (RPM) for example\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n97\n\n7.2.3  3-Axis Zero Momentum Stabilization\n\nA generalized functional diagram of a typical 3-Axis Zero Momentum spacecraft \nADACS is shown in Fig.\u00a07.6.\n\nA block diagram of the ADACS for a 3-axis Zero Momentum system is shown in \nFig.\u00a07.7\n\nFig. 7.6 Functional diagram of a 3-axis zero momentum ADACS\n\nFig. 7.7 Block diagram of a 3-axis zero momentum ADACS\n\n7.2  Description of\u00a0the\u00a0Most Common ADACS Systems\n\n\n\n98\n\n7.2.4  Magnetic Spin Stabilization\n\nAnother method of stabilizing a spacecraft is to cause it to spin about an axis. A \nproperty of a gyroscope is that the direction of the spin axis will remain fixed with \nrespect to inertial space. If the satellite mass distribution is designed with a diagonal \ninertia matrix (cross products are zero or negligible) with respect to the spacecraft \nprincipal axes, then stable spin can be maintained about the major or minor inertia \naxis (but not the intermediate). Spinning can be initiated either by interaction \nbetween a torque rod on the spacecraft with the Earth magnetic field, or by \nthrusters.\n\nThe early Hughes communication satellites were spin stabilized. Another exam-\nple of spin stabilized satellites is a three-plane, seven spacecraft per plane constel-\nlation performing continuous \u201cbent-pipe\u201d analog voice communication. Only one \nplane of these were built and flown. These spacecraft were spinning at 3\u00a0s/revolution \nnormal to the 823\u00a0km orbit of 82\u00b0 inclination. Spinning was accomplished by a \nsingle torque rod in the orbit plane, spinning with the spacecraft, and activated in \nresponse to a radial Earth horizon scanner. Images of one of the spacecraft and the \nfootprints of the spacecraft in the constellation are shown in Fig.\u00a07.8.\n\nFig. 7.8 Three planes of 7 spin stabilized \u201cBent Pipe\u201d satellites, each spinning about an axis \nnormal to the orbit plane, provide nearly continuous communications\n\nThe spin RPM should be selected so that the spacecraft angular momentum \nshould be 10 or more times the angular momentum due to the spacecraft rotation \naround the orbit. Since the orbit rate is 360\u00b0 per Orbit Period (96.518\u00a0min), or 0.01 \nRPM, spinning the spacecraft faster than about 0.1 RPM (36\u00b0/sec) should result in \na stable spin with the spin axis normal to the orbit plane. This orientation is the \nminimum energy state.\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n99\n\n7.3  The ADACS Components\n\nSelecting and sizing components of an ADACS system are described next.\n\n7.3.1  Reaction Wheels and\u00a0Sizing the\u00a0Wheels\n\nReaction wheels consist of a mass rotated by a brushless DC motor. The motor \napplies torque to the wheel inertia and, hence, an equal and opposite torque to the \nspacecraft body; this is used for attitude maneuvers and for pointing the payload. In \naddition to providing torques for maneuvering spacecraft attitude, reaction wheels \nalso provide momentum storage. The wheel parameters of interest are the available \ntorque and momentum storage (product of wheel inertia and maximum speed).\n\nNon-conservative external environmental moments (e.g. aerodynamic, gravity gra-\ndient, residual magnetic dipole, etc.) cause the control system to command corrective \ntorques that accumulate in the wheels as stored momentum JW?. If not unloaded by \nthe electromagnets, ? would eventually reach a saturation limit (typically 5000\u00a0 \u2013 \n10,000\u00a0rpm) and not allow the wheel to apply any more torque in that direction.\n\nUnbalances in the rotors (on the order of mg-mm for CubeSat wheels to gm-cm \nfor SmallSat wheels) can create jitter torques that disturb pointing the payload and \ncan also excite structural modes that further disturb pointing.\n\nThe torque necessary to provide a given maneuvering bandwidth determines \nmaximum torque requirements. The dynamics of rigid body tracking a sinusoidal \ncommand of frequency, ?, and amplitude, A, are:\n\n \n??? ?= ( )2 Asin ?t  (7.7)\n\nSubstituting: ?\u00a0=\u00a0?/ISC the peak torque required is:\n\n ? = I ASC ?\n2\n\n (7.8)\n\nFor illustrative purposes, a typical small spacecraft has an inertia of 2.1\u00a0kg-m2 \nand tracks a target having a position uncertainty of 0.1\u00a0deg. with a bandwidth of \n0.25\u00a0Hz. The torque required is 9 mNm. Typical small spacecraft wheels can pro-\nvide about 25 mNm maximum torque.\n\nThe maximum momentum that has to be stored influences the required wheel \nsize. Due to external torques, momentum accumulates and is transferred to and from \nthe body during maneuvers. Momentum storage during maneuvering is usually \nmuch greater than that due to momentum management. As already stated, wheels \nsaturate around 5000\u201310,000\u00a0rpm, placing additional constraints on the system. If \nthe same spacecraft is to slew at a rate of 5\u00b0/sec, then the required momentum stor-\nage is ISC ? or 183 mNms. If the wheel inertia is 0.001 kgm2 (typical for a small \nspacecraft wheel) then the peak speed is 1750\u00a0rpm.\n\nThe table in Fig.\u00a07.9 shows torque and momentum capacities of representative \nwheels\n\n7.3  The ADACS Components\n\n\n\n100\n\nIn most 3-axis stabilized spacecraft, maneuvering requirements determine the \nmaximum wheel torque needed. For example, if the spacecraft weighs 120 lbs. \nand is 20? \u00d7 20? \u00d7 30?, it has a pitch/roll moment of inertia about its CG of \n?2.812 slug- ft2. If the goal is to have the agility of slewing the spacecraft 20\u00b0 in \n5s, a reaction wheel with maximum torque capability of 0.157\u00a0ft.-lbs. (0.13558\u00a0Nm) \nis required. The Millenium reaction wheel in Fig.\u00a07.9 comes close to this maxi-\nmum torque capability. With the Millenium wheel, the above spacecraft could be \nslewed 20 degrees in 7.296s. The slew maneuver consists of constant maximum \ntorque for 3.648s, at which instant the spacecraft will have slewed 10\u00b0. This is \nfollowed by a constant negative torque of equal duration to decelerate the space-\ncraft to a halt at 20\u00b0.\n\n7.3.2  Torque Coils or Rods: Momentum Unloading\n\nTorque Rods are used to unload accumulated momentum of the reaction wheels and \nto detumble the spacecraft after separation from the launch vehicle. To determine \nthe amount of built-up momentum that can be unloaded by a torque rod (or coil) \ninvolves a simulation that runs the spacecraft around the Earth and integrates the \nexternal torques as a function of time. The total integrated momentum is the maxi-\nmum that can be dumped by the magnetic torquers per orbit. This needs to be less \nthan the expected accumulation due to all external disturbance torques.\n\nWhen the spacecraft is on orbit, external disturbance torques will cause the reac-\ntion wheels to spin up over time. To prevent this, magnetic coils are used to continu-\nously desaturate the wheels by applying a torque to the body that causes the wheels \nto despin when they correct for it.\n\nIt is easy to run a simulation in Matlab to model the spacecraft on orbit and \nmodel the geomagnetic field. Consider a nadir-pointing spacecraft flying in a circu-\nlar orbit at 450\u00a0km altitude and 45\u00b0 inclination. The secular magnetic field in the \nbody frame is shown in Fig.\u00a07.10. It was generated by a 10th order IGRF model. In \nthis figure, Blue is X, Green is Y, and Red is the Z axis.\n\nA CubeSat ADACS system, the MAI-100, has magnetic coils of 0.037 Am2 \n maximum dipole strength. The magnetic moment r, produced by energizing the \ncoils, is the cross product of the dipole m and the secular magnetic field B.\n\nManufacturer Model Maximum Available\nTorque (mNm)\n\nMax.

The \nresult is shown in Fig.\u00a07.11. Again, Blue is X, Green is Y and Red is Z.\n\nFig. 7.10 The earth magnetic field vector over one orbit\n\nMagnetic Torques in Body\n3\n\n\u00d7 10-6\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-2\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n\nTrue Anomally (deg)\n\nT\nor\n\nqu\ne \n\n(N\nm\n\n)\n\nFig. 7.11 Available magnetic torque during one orbit\n\nFinally, integrate the magnetic torques over an orbit to get the total momentum \nthat can be unloaded by torque coils. This is shown in Fig.\u00a07.12.\n\nA total of almost 8 mNms can be dumped per orbit. To correct for inefficiencies \nin the secular field model and for other reasons, the actual momentum that can be \n\n7.3  The ADACS Components\n\n\n\n102\n\ndumped per orbit is about 0.5\u20130.3 times that which the model calculated. The space-\ncraft designer should be sure that the total momentum accumulated from external \ntorques should not exceed this.\n\nSome spacecraft use torque rods while others use torque coils. Torque coils have an \nadvantage over torque rods in that coils do not produce residual magnetic fields (when \nno current is applied), while even the best torque rods with the thinnest magnetic hys-\nteresis curve iron core retain some residual magnetic field. If the spacecraft is relatively \nsmall, for a given B field, torque rods are lighter than coils; but when the spacecraft is \nlarge and has a large area around which a coil can be wound, coils are lighter.\n\nOne other feature of torque coils or rods that the designer must take into account \nis the inductance of the torquer. Torquers are most often used in a bang-bang man-\nner (the torquer is either energized at full strength or not energized at all). Varying \nthe duty cycle (or the duration of pulsed operation of the torquers) produces the \nrequired average torque.\n\nSince the spacecraft has a magnetometer to measure the Earth magnetic field, \ncare must be taken that the use of torquers should not affect magnetic field measure-\nments. For this reason, the magnetometer readings are taken when the torquers are \nOFF, and when the magnetic field created by them has decayed enough to be below \nthe Earth magnetic field intensity at the location of the magnetometer.\n\n7.3.3  Star Trackers\n\nIf spacecraft attitude knowledge better than 0.1\u00b0 is required, Star Trackers must be \nused. A star tracker is a (typically) 15\u00b0 \u00d7 15\u00b0 Field of View CCD camera with com-\nputer to match the observed star field to a star catalog to determine spacecraft posi-\ntion and attitude.\n\nStar tracker accuracies, weights and costs vary considerably. The Ball Aerospace \nHigh Accuracy Star tracker (HAST), for example, achieves 0.2 arc-second (5.5 \u00d7 \n10?5 degree) accuracy. The Sinclair ST-16 accuracy is about 7 arc-sec (0.0002\u00b0).\n\n8\n\nM\nom\n\nen\ntu\n\nm\n (\n\nm\nN\n\nm\nse\n\nc)\n\nTrue Anomaly (deg)\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n\nFig. 7.12 Total momentum that can be unloaded by the torquers\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n103\n\nStar Trackers image fixed stars, measuring their vectors in the body frame and \ncalculating the spacecraft attitude with respect to inertial space. Star Trackers have \nbeen historically large and expensive; however, recently a new low cost generation \nhas become available, based on technology used in Digital Cameras and Smart \nPhones. The Maryland Aerospace Inc. Star Tracker, shown in Fig.\u00a07.13, for exam-\nple, weighs less than 200 gm, and features automatic star identification and attitude \ndetermination to 0.013\u00b0 at a 4\u00a0Hz update rate.\n\nFig. 7.13 Miniature star tracker in a 5\u00a0cm3 form factor (Courtesy of Maryland Aerospace)\n\nA unique feature of contemporary units is their ability to autonomously recognize \nvisible stars in real time with no apriori information, known in the industry as Lost-In-\nSpace attitude determination. Generally, the implementation is based on the observa-\ntion that the angular separation between any 2 bright stars is a unique signature, and \nby comparing the measured separation of stars seen on an image with a catalog of \nseparations, the two components may be identified. A third star is required to resolve \nthe ambiguity and, in practice, a 4th star is required for positive identification, Ref. 37.\n\nTo give adequate all-sky coverage with a compact star catalog, a lens of short \nfocal length and a wide field of view is required. The lens of the above unit is f 1.2 \nwith a FOV of 14\u00b0\u00d719\u00b0; the required catalog has only 1825 stars. This is large \nenough to insure that at least 4 stars of the catalog are visible in 99.6% of the sky.\n\nMost star trackers can tolerate the Moon in the FOV but saturate when the Sun or \nEarth are in the FOV.\u00a0Large baffles can reject bright objects outside the FOV.\u00a0Star \ntrackers are usually mounted on the satellite tilted up and away from the Earth and \non a side facing away from the Sun.\n\nBecause of spacecraft maneuvering requirements, and because of the possibility \nthat either the Sun or the Moon may enter the star tracker FOV, many spacecraft fly \ntwo star trackers (usually oriented 90\u00b0 apart).\n\nFigure 7.14 shows the fraction of passes on which a Star Tracker, pointing in the \n-X (anti-RAM) direction, is unavailable because either the sun or the moon are in its \nFOV.\n\n7.3  The ADACS Components\n\n\n\n104\n\nIt is seen from Fig. 7.15 that pointing the Star Tracker to the side reduces the \nfraction of the time the Sun or Moon are in the FOV of the star tracker. If the \nspacecraft is permitted to yaw a little bit on days the star tracker would be \n\nFig. 7.14 Star tracker (pointing in -X direction) unavailable because either the sun  \nor the moon is in its FOV\n\nFig. 7.15 Star Tracker (pointing in -Y direction) unavailable\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n105\n\n otherwise unavailable, yawing would make it useful again. The conclusion is that \nthe designer must calculate the times the star tracker would be unavailable, and \ndecide whether to use one or two trackers and also decide in which direction the \ntrackers should point.\n\n7.3.4  GPS Receivers\n\nGPS data are most useful when pointing a payload at a terrestrial target relative to \nthe orbit frame, when it is required to know precise relative position. Imaging \npayloads may have FOVs of 0.5\u00b0 or less. From an altitude of 600\u00a0km, the FOV \nmay be on the order of 3\u00a0km. Thus, the SC position should be known to about \n300\u00a0m. The permissible time error is on the order of 50\u00a0msec. This is well within \nthe capability of inexpensive GPS receivers. An example of a low cost GPS \nreceiver that was used on several CubeSat spacecraft is the NovaTel OEM7 \nreceiver, shown in Fig.\u00a07.16.\n\nFig. 7.16 A small GPS receiver (NovaTel)\n\nGenerally, these receivers are intended for terrestrial use and contain software \nthat limit the maximum velocity and altitude. These limitations need to be removed \nfor space flight. In addition, they output position data in the ECEF frame that needs \nto be transformed to the J2000 (or other inertial) frame. This needs to be done \n\n7.3  The ADACS Components\n\n\n\n106\n\n precisely since nutation and precession terms can account for large position errors. \nThe mathematics for ECEF to ECI transformations are in Reference 37, and Matlab, \nC++ implementation in http://www.celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.asp\n\nAccuracy of GPS receivers is generally on the order of 10\u00a0m or so; however, \ndepending on the geometry of the orbit relative to the NAVSTAR GPS constellation, \nperiodic dropouts of up to 20\u00a0min may occur. This can be mitigated by the use of \ndata from the GLONASS and Galileo constellations. The aggregate GPS availabil-\nity is still not 100%.\n\nTo propagate across the dropouts and to refine the position and velocity data, a \nKalman filter is used to estimate the orbit state. The filter compares the residuals \nbetween successive GPS observations and an analytical propagation model to refine \na state estimate that becomes more precise with time. The model may include the \neffects of perturbations also, such as J2 and atmospheric drag. During dropouts, the \nmodel is integrated forward in time to produce a state estimate in the absence of \ndata. An estimate of the error in the state, called the covariance, is also calculated. \nReference 67 is a treatise on the mathematics and methods of orbit determination by \nKalman filtering.\n\nGPS receivers can also be used to provide spacecraft attitude (by use of multiple \nGPS receive antennas). For example, for an antenna baseline of 20? (RADCAL \nspacecraft), attitude accuracy of 0.3\u00b0 was achieved.\n\nAs stated above, from GPS data the spacecraft can also propagate the equations of \nmotion and obtain its own spacecraft orbital elements. It is also a very accurate time \nstandard. In addition, a GPS receiver is relatively inexpensive, small and has low \npower consumption. It is a very cost-effective instrument to have on a spacecraft.\n\n7.3.5  Other ADACS Components\n\nIn addition to the reaction wheels, torquers, Star Trackers and GPS receivers already \ndiscussed, a 3-axis zero momentum spacecraft stabilization system often has Sun \nsensors, a 3-Axis Magnetometer and an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) for tracking \nduring a maneuver.\n\n7.3.6  The ADACS Computer and\u00a0Algorithms\n\nIn a pitch bias momentum stabilized spacecraft, the ADACS computer functions are \nquite simple. The computer determines the nadir direction (by bisecting the Earth \nIR pulse from a scanning earth sensor). It then compares the nadir direction with the \nZ axis of the spacecraft, and it commands increasing or decreasing reaction wheel \nspeeds to minimize the error between the measured nadir and the Z axis of the \nspacecraft. If the wheel speed approaches saturation, the torquers are used to unload \nwheel momentum.\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\nhttp://www.celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.asp\n\n\n107\n\nIn a 3-axis zero momentum stabilized spacecraft, the ADACS computer per-\nforms the following functions:\n\n\u2022 Accepts attitude commands from the C&DH\n\u2022 Accepts sensor outputs from the magnetometer, Sun sensor, GPS receiver, star \n\ntrackers\n\u2022 Determines present spacecraft attitude and the Error from the commanded attitude\n\u2022 Computes commanded functions (slewing, changing attitude, pointing to targets)\n\u2022 Computes reaction wheel and torque rod drives\n\u2022 Propagates the orbit\n\u2022 Computes the orbital elements\n\u2022 Outputs ADACS telemetry and Time to the C&DH\n\nIn the Maryland Aerospace Inc. ADACS system, all this is performed in a single \nboard computer. This PCB also contains the reaction wheel drivers and the other I/O \nrequired to interface with all of the ADACS hardware components.\n\n7.3.7  ADACS Modes\n\nThe ADACS can function in one of several attitude determination or attitude control \nmodes. These modes can be selected by either ground command or autonomously, \ne.g. if a fault were detected. Modes are specific to every spacecraft, since they \ndepend upon the mission and equipment complement. For robustness and operating \nsimplicity, the number of modes should be minimized. Three or four modes are usu-\nally all that are required. For a representative 3-axis zero momentum spacecraft with \nreaction wheels, electromagnets, sun sensors, star tracker, gyro and magnetometer, \nthe modes are as follows:\n\nAttitude Control Modes\n\n\u2022 Acquisition\u00a0 \u2013 After deployment from the launch vehicle, the spacecraft may \ntumble with unknown body rates. The torque rods are used in a Bdot mode where \nthey are turned on and off out of phase with the secular magnetic field rate as \nsensed by the magnetometer. This has the effect of removing energy from the \nbody and damping the rates. The end of the acquisition mode is when body rates \nare below ?0.1\u00b0/sec. The acquisition mode can also be used as a safe mode if an \nanomaly is detected.\n\n\u2022 Nadir Pointing\u00a0\u2013 The wheels are used to capture the attitude and stabilize the \nspacecraft with the Z body axis pointing toward the subsatellite point and the X \nbody axis pointing into the ram direction. The nadir direction is determined from \nknowledge of the spacecraft position on orbit. Wheel momentum is managed \nwith electromagnets. Offsets from the nadir attitude can be commanded to point \nto targets displaced from the ground track. By continuously updating the point-\ning command it is possible to keep the payload line of sight stabilized at a con-\nstant latitude and longitude on the Earth geoid.\n\n7.3  The ADACS Components\n\n\n\n108\n\n\u2022 Inertial Pointing\u00a0\u2013 This mode is similar to nadir pointing except that the  payload \nline of sight is pointing to a fixed target in the sky such as the Sun or a distant star. \nMoving targets can be tracked by continuously updating the pointing quaternion \nas in a laser communication or space surveillance mission.\n\nAttitude Determination Modes\n\n\u2022 Bdot\u00a0\u2013 Attitude is not determined, but the rate of change of the secular magnetic \nfield in the body frame is measured by the backward difference of consecutive \nmagnetometer measurements. The magnetic field rate is known as Bdot and is \nmultiplied by a gain to specify the commands to the torque rods to effect body \nrate damping in acquisition mode.\n\n\u2022 Sun Sensor/Magnetometer\u00a0\u2013 Sun Sensor and Magnetometer are used to mea-\nsure the Sun and secular magnetic field vectors in the body frame. These are \ncompared with the inertial vectors calculated from the Sun and IGRF magnetic \nfield models, respectively, using Cross Product or Triad attitude determination. \nSun sensor measurements can only be performed during the daylight portion of \nthe orbit and require an initialization of the ephemeris. Sun sensors and magne-\ntometers provide an all-aspect measurement of attitude that allows the ADACS \nto capture attitude for nadir pointing.\n\n\u2022 Star Tracker/Gyro\u00a0\u2013 A very precise quaternion is provided by star vector mea-\nsurements. Between updates, attitude is propagated using the gyro. A Kalman \nfilter is generally used to estimate gyro bias and to reduce measurement noise. \nOnce the filter has converged, large angle slews can be made at rates that exceed \nthe maximum tracking rate of the Star Tracker, generally 3\u20135\u00b0/sec.\n\n7.4  Attitude Control System Design Methodologies\n\nA methodology to develop ADACS control laws is to design them using analyti-\ncal techniques, and then verify, test and fine tune them using time domain simu-\nlations. Algorithmic formulations are adequately covered in the literature, so \nthey will not be repeated here. The authors have found References 68 (Wertz), 14 \n(Flatley) and 71 (Wie) to be very useful, and have had success designing attitude \ncontrollers with them.\n\nAs a first step in developing control laws, preliminary gains are calculated using \nlinear analytical techniques. Methodologies for doing this are well covered in the \nliterature, see for example Reference 71. In addition, the Matlab control system \ntoolbox contains many utilities that can be employed, e.g. place.m, lqr.m, rlocus.m, \netc. Given the inertia properties of the spacecraft and the desired dynamic perfor-\nmance characteristics, gains for magnetic, reaction wheel and thruster actuators \nmay be determined along with their stability margins.\n\nOnce a gain set has been determined, it is essential to verify and test it in a high \nfidelity time domain software simulation. A dynamic simulator provides an all \n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n109\n\nFig. 7.17 KEDS3D dynamic simulator GUI (Maryland Aerospace)\n\nOn the simulator computer is the spacecraft simulation that can be tailored for \nthe dynamics of any arbitrary spacecraft through an input file. High fidelity math \nmodels of the spacecraft and the on-orbit environment are incorporated including:\n\n\u2022 Rigid body dynamics\n\u2022 Orbital mechanics model\n\u2022 IGRF magnetic field model\n\u2022 Atmospheric density model\n\u2022 Aerodynamic torques\n\u2022 Residual Dipole Torques\n\u2022 Gravity gradient torques\n\u2022 Sun position\n\u2022 Solar pressure torques\n\nMany of the math models used in KEDS3d were adapted from Refs. 72, 16 and \n74. They are highly recommended for anyone doing work in this field. An example \nof one of the math models is the magnetic field shown below Fig.\u00a07.18.\n\nIn addition, the progress of the mission can be followed in real time on the GUI \nwhich features an animated display of spacecraft attitude.\n\n software standalone test set, and can also be used later in a Hardware-In-The-Loop \n(HITL) environment. The concept is to simulate the dynamics of the satellite and \nthe space environment in real time on a PC.\u00a0A screenshot of the simulation is shown \nbelow (Fig.\u00a07.17).\n\n7.4  Attitude Control System Design Methodologies\n\n\n\n110\n\nMany different mission scenarios of spacecraft maneuvering can be constructed \nand run in order to validate the ADACS in all of its various pointing modes. The \ndynamic simulator thus forms the cornerstone of a comprehensive system validation \nand verification test program.\n\nSimulations may be controlled and monitored in real time using a GSE GUI that \nsends and receives ADACS commands and telemetry. The GUI is identical in func-\ntion to the display that would be seen on a ground control station, Fig.\u00a07.21.

Qbo Command\u00a0\u2013 Allows input of a quaternion command in Roll, Pitch, Yaw. \nThe euler angles with respect to the orbit frame (3-2-1 sequence) are converted \nto an orbit-to-body quaternion Qbo, by pressing the Calc Qbo Cmd pushbutton. \nPressing Send Qbo transmits the command to the MAI-200.\n\n7.5  Integration and\u00a0Test\n\nAn efficient way of testing the ADACS subsystem is to use a Hardware-In-The- \nLoop (HITL) benchtop test set. A HITL test employs a computer model of the \nspacecraft dynamics, and it contains a model of the orbital environment. It runs in \nreal time and operates in conjunction with the ADACS computer and other hard-\nware sensors and actuators of the spacecraft. The HITL generates the components \nof the Earth magnetic field at the instantaneous location of the spacecraft, and the \ncomponents of the Sun vector. It also produces the disturbance torques the space-\ncraft is likely to see. Feeding these quantities back to the spacecraft, the spacecraft \nresponds by generating the reaction wheel and torquer commands. The HITL then \n\u201cflies\u201d the spacecraft by executing the changes in the spacecraft attitude (and com-\nputing spacecraft position changes).\n\nIn this way, the performance of the ADACS can be tested. The use of a HILP test \nis invaluable in testing and debugging the software and characterizing on-orbit \n performance and behavior. Simulations several days long can be run, lending confi-\ndence that the system will perform reliably on-orbit.\n\nA block diagram of a typical HITL test set is shown in Fig.\u00a07.20. This diagram \nwas drawn for the QbX 4\u00a0U CubeSat. Attitude determination and control is per-\nformed by the MAI-100 integrated ADACS.\u00a0The 3D software simulator computes \nthe spacecraft dynamic responses to reaction wheel, electromagnet and orbital \nenvironmental torques in exactly real time. Electrical interfaces between the MAI-\n100 ADACS and the simulation computer are identical to the actual QbX space-\ncraft, so that the MAI-100\u00a0in the loop believes that it is flying the real spacecraft \non-orbit. The HITL system can provide an End-to-End performance validation of \nADACS pointing accuracy. In addition, other related spacecraft systems that \nimpact pointing performance are simulated, including performances of the \nElectrical Power System, the Command and Data Handling System, and the \nCommunications System.\n\nTo visually see the performance of the ADACS subsystem, the point to which the \nspacecraft Z axis points as a function of time can be displayed together with the \nground track of the spacecraft, as shown in Fig.\u00a07.21. In this figure, one of the out-\nputs of the Dynamic Simulator, the spacecraft ground track is shown as the purple \nline, while the \u201caim point\u201d of the spacecraft as a function of time is shown by the \nred line.\n\nThe scenario shown in this figure is one where three targets must be imaged. The \nspacecraft enters the area covered by the display at the bottom of the figure and \n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n113\n\nFig. 7.20 Flatsat dynamic simulator for QbX, Earth-Pointing Nanosat\n\nFig. 7.21 The dynamic simulator \u201cflies\u201d the spacecraft in a hardware-in-the-loop to permit \nassessing ADACS performance\n\n7.5  Integration and\u00a0Test\n\n\n\n114\n\nadvances initially along the yellow arrow. Attitude commands then cause the space-\ncraft to roll to reach the first target roll angle and then settle, awaiting the instance \nwhen the FOV (shown as the white rectangles) reaches the target. The first image is \nthen taken. The spacecraft then slews to the roll angle of the second target and set-\ntles at that roll angle until it is time to take the second image. Imaging the third \ntarget is accomplished in the same way. Finally, the spacecraft is caused to slew \nback to nadir, awaiting further commands.\n\n7.6  On Orbit Checkout\n\nOnce the spacecraft is on orbit, checkout of the ADACS can begin. First, proper \nfunctioning of each of the ADACS components is verified by causing the spacecraft \nto perform simple functions. An example is to roll the spacecraft (say) 10\u00b0. The roll \nacceleration and deceleration commands are executed (open loop), and the change \nin attitude, as measured by the Star Tracker(s), is noted. This verifies that the reac-\ntion wheel torques are as specified on the ground.\n\nNext, ADACS system level tests are performed. The spacecraft is caused to roll \nand pitch to point to a known target on the ground. Repeated performance of this \ntest can establish component misalignments and other bias errors, and it can also be \nused to verify that the loop gains are correct. ADACS software uploads can be used \nto correct for these biases.\n\n7 Attitude Determination and\u00a0Control System (ADACS)\n\n\n\n115\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_8\n\nChapter 8\nSpacecraft Software\n\nSpacecraft software is discussed here in terms of (1) the functions the software has \nto perform, (2) the software architecture and (3) the manner in which the functions \nare performed. While the functions the software has to perform are generic, there \ncan be different architectures and different methods of implementing the functions. \nHere, a point design is described, a design with a lot of flight heritage over many \ndifferent spacecraft. The spacecraft missions in this example are:\n\n\u2022 Store and Forward communications\n\u2022 Collecting data from and commanding unattended remote sensors\n\u2022 Imaging designated targets and downlinking image data from the spacecraft to \n\nground stations\n\nThe spacecraft software utilizes a distributed processing environment. It has \nC&DH and ADACS computers. They operate independently; only ADACS house-\nkeeping telemetry data flows from ADACS to the C&DH and only changes in \nADACS requirements or orbital parameters (or target location) data and time flow \nfrom the C&DH to the ADACS computer. Communication functions are performed \nby the C&DH, but there may be a separate, dedicated image data processor (not \ndiscussed here).\n\nThe software can be thought of as consisting of three distinct software modules, \neach consisting of many different submodules. The three main modules are:\n\n 1. Command and Data Handling System (C&DH) software\n 2. Attitude Determination and Control System (ADACS) software\n 3. Communications Processor Subsystem software\n\nThe C&DH software contains the spacecraft bus operating software and the mis-\nsion payload specific software. Spacecraft communications software may reside in \nthe C&DH or it may be in a separate communications processor.\n\n\n\n116\n\n8.1  Functions and\u00a0Software Architecture\n\nThe spacecraft bus C&DH software performs the following functions:\n\n 1. Initializing the C&DH processor, hardware, and operating system\n 2. Executing scheduled events, housekeeping, communications, telemetry\n 3. Communicating with ground stations or mobile users (when in the\n\nvicinity of these users)\n 4. Management of the on-board electric power system\n 5. Management of the on-board thermal control system\n 6. Collecting, computing and formatting spacecraft telemetry\n 7. Storing and retrieving data, messages and statistics\n 8. Managing the message memory\n\nExpanding on the Communication functions listed above, the functions include:\n\n\u2022 Communications transmitter frequency selection,\n\u2022 Transmission of messages and data,\n\u2022 Selection of CMD or uplink message frequency\n\u2022 Reception and processing uplink commands\n\u2022 Storing messages\n\u2022 Accepting uplinked software to augment or change spacecraft software\n\u2022 Collection, storage and processing of user access authorization data,\n\u2022 Message collection, routing and acknowledgment\n\nThe ADACS Processor performs:\n\n\u2022 Propagating the orbit from uplinked orbital elements or from on-board GPS\n\u2022 Reading the data from all attitude and position sensors\n\u2022 Kalman filtering sensor data to obtain optimum spacecraft attitude\n\u2022 Receiving and interpreting commands to the ADACS (from the C&DH \n\ncomputer)\n\u2022 Performing attitude control computations\n\u2022 Controlling reaction wheel speeds and torque rod activities\n\u2022 Controlling propulsion subsystem activities (if applicable)\n\u2022 Controlling thruster activities\n\u2022 Collecting ADACS telemetry and sending it to the C&DH\n\u2022 Sending accurate orbital elements to the C&DH\n\u2022 Sending accurate time to the C&DH\n\nThe Payload Processor performs the management of payload functions and col-\nlecting payload data.\n\nThe software hierarchy diagram is shown in Fig.\u00a08.1. The Executive controls the \ncomputer operating system. The operating system and all software are typically written \nin C++ or in machine language. Often multiple copies of the bootstrap program reside \nin radiation hard Fuse Link PROM for redundancy; the main program is in Flash \nEPROM.\u00a0All spacecraft bus operations are performed on a time schedule, programma-\n\n8 Spacecraft Software\n\n\n\n117\n\nble from the ground and employing default values on the spacecraft. Hardware counters \nprogrammed by the C&DH execute the schedule, and perform repetitive operations in \nresponse to a single command. All high speed and low level operations are relegated to \nthe multiple, high speed communications processors that operate autonomously. They \nare powered up only when needed. This reduces high speed requirements of the C&DH, \npermitting it to operate at a relatively low duty cycle, conserving electric power.\n\nThough not required by throughput and speed requirements, ADACS functions \nare performed in a separate processor that communicates with the C&DH only by \ntwo-way file transfer of telemetry and commands. C&DH and the ADACS codes are \nresident in both processors; however, each processor executes only its assigned \nfunctions (C&DH or ADACS). In case of hardware failure in either the C&DH or \nthe ADACS processor, the other processor can perform the other\u2019s functions, but \ncomputer loading becomes much higher. During high communications traffic peri-\nods, operating with only one processor, highly computationally intensive functions \nmust be eliminated. Kalman filtering of the multiple attitude sensor data is compu-\ntationally intensive and is eliminated at those times, reverting to the use of the \n(ground designated) single sensor for attitude determination. Generally this will be \nthe GPS attitude determination or a star tracker, if there is one on board.\n\nThe software architecture consists of the Executive and the Subroutines for \naccomplishing the various tasks. The Executive schedules hardware, electric power \nand ADAC interface initialization, Operating System initialization, State \nDetermination, Mass Memory initialization, Default Schedule initialization, and the \nIdle Task. The Executive operates the Idle Task in which the Executive cycles \nthrough all of the potential tasks (subroutines) it might have to perform, to deter-\nmine if there is anything it has to do. It does this at a low clock speed to conserve \npower. If, while cycling through potential tasks, the Executive finds one that requires \nexecution, it switches the processor to high speed and causes the appropriate sub-\nroutine to execute the required task. It services interrupts in the same manner.\n\nExecutive\n\nEPS Management,\nTTM Collection\n\nScheduler\n\nThermal Management,\nTTM Collection\n\nSpacecraft\nInitialization\n\nUp/Down\nCommunications\n\nMessage and Data\nManagement\n\nADACS\nComputer\n\nSpacecraft\nC&C\n\nFig. 8.1 Software architecture and software modules\n\n8.1 Functions and\u00a0Software Architecture\n\n\n\n118\n\n8.2  Performing Each Function or Module\n\n8.2.1  Initialization of\u00a0the\u00a0CDH Processor, Hardware, \nand\u00a0Operating System\n\nOnce the C&DH is released from the reset condition (held during ascent until the \nseparation switch indicates that the spacecraft has been released from the launch \nvehicle), the C&DH performs a Flash EPROM Operating System check, and initial-\nizes the hardware and nonvolatile RAM variables. The Mass Memory is tested for \nunusable blocks. After all the start-up tasks have been initialized, the C&DH loads \nthe Default Schedule. The Default Schedule consists of a C&DH State of Health \n(SOH) telemetry collection event, and a communications event. The C&DH per-\nforms the communications event repeatedly until communications with the ground \nstation is successful. After the Default Schedule is loaded, the C&DH transitions to \nthe Idle Task to cycle through the spacecraft subsystems for possible action.\n\nThe ADACS is released from reset at the same time as the C&DH and performs \na similar initialization sequence. This sequence will be described later in the ADACS \nsoftware section; however, the portion of the ADACS initialization that is pertinent \nto the C&DH initialization will be described here.\n\nThe ADACS computer will complete initialization before the C&DH because its \ninitialization sequence is shorter. The C&DH listens for notification by the ADACS \ncomputer that its initialization is completed and is ready for commands. The C&DH \nsynchronizes time with the ADACS and commands the ADACS to begin State of \nHealth data collection.\n\nThe Idle Task maintains the C&DH computer in a slow clock mode to conserve \npower. The tasks performed include resetting the watchdog timer, validating the operat-\ning system in EDAC memory, EPS monitoring and recovery, and interrupt handling.\n\nThe interrupt handler monitors the real-time clock alarm (Event Execution Time), \noperating system time tick, GSE port service, communication reception and trans-\nmission service, and watches for unscheduled communications from mobile users.\n\n8.2.2  Executing Scheduled Events\n\nAll scheduled events use the real-time clock alarm function to start execution. The \nalarm is set to the time of the next event by the Scheduler at the completion of the \nprevious event. Prior to executing the event, the watchdog timer is reset. Since the \nwatchdog timer duration is usually twice the longest event duration, and the watch-\ndog timer is reset on entry to each event, all events are executed without regard to \nthe watchdog timer duration. After the watchdog timer is reset, the event is per-\nformed. When the event is completed, the next event is removed from the schedule, \nand the real-time clock alarm is set for this event and the ADACS computer returns \nto the Idle Task.\n\n8 Spacecraft Software\n\n\n\n119\n\nThe scheduler performs three major functions: (1) disassembles and interprets \ncommands received during a communications event, (2) identifies the next execut-\nable event, and (3) validates the scheduler command sequence queue. Each com-\nmand is validated in three ways: the satellite access password is checked to determine \nwhether the ground station has the authority to schedule commands, the CRC of the \npacket containing the commands is checked to be sure it has been received correctly, \nand the CRC on each command is checked before placing it in the schedule.\n\nIf the command is valid, it is placed in the schedule in time-order sequence. If an \nerror is detected, the command is discarded. The spacecraft schedule can be teleme-\ntered to the ground for verification.\n\nAfter the event is executed, the scheduler readies the command to be performed \nnext and sets the alarm for the specified event execution time. An event can resched-\nule itself at a later time. This allows self-scheduling repetitive events, such as telem-\netry collection, to only require a single command (schedule memory location). The \nspacecraft is capable of storing a large number of commands (counting repetitive \ncommands as a single command) in EDAC memory. The iterative execution of com-\nmands continues until the schedule is exhausted or new commands are received. If \nthe scheduler ever becomes empty, it loads the default schedule that contains the \n\u201cBeep/Receive\u201d communications event. Also, if a communicate event is not sched-\nuled for the next 3 days, the scheduler places a communicate event (\u201cBeep/Receive\u201d) \nin the schedule. This tells the master ground station that the satellite is out of sched-\nule and needs servicing.\n\nThe \u201cBeep-Receive\u201d communications event is a repetitious spacecraft transmit \nevent (transmitting \u201cRoutine Telemetry\u201d), followed by activation of the spacecraft \ncommand receiver for a specified time interval. So, if communication is lost with \nthe spacecraft, or if someone just forgot to send up a schedule, the spacecraft goes \ninto short transmission \u201cBeeps\u201d every (say) 1 min, to tell the world within its line of \nsight that the spacecraft is here and it has no schedule to execute. This feature proved \nvery useful in many instances when, for one reason or another, the spacecraft got \n\u201clost.\u201d Because of the intermittent nature of the transmit events, the power required \nto execute \u201cBeep-Receive\u201d is quite low.\n\nAll events are self-routing, i.e., if the event is destined for a processor other that \nthe C&DH, the code for that event will route it to the proper destination processor.\n\n8.2.3  Stored Command Execution\n\nThe satellite operates on an internal schedule, executing commands uplinked and \nstored in memory together with the time when commands are to be executed. \nUplinked commands are processed by the spacecraft to extract pointer information \nwith which time sequential commands can be retrieved from memory for execution \nregardless of the order in which these commands were sent up to the spacecraft. The \ntime to execute the commands is determined on the ground from the spacecraft \norbital parameters used by the ground station. The ground station computes the time \n\n8.2 Performing Each Function or Module\n\n\n\n120\n\nwhen the spacecraft will be over the specific areas on the ground where the command \nis to be executed. Exceptions are commands to the ADACS to point the spacecraft \nto a given point on Earth and take a picture. The ADACS has all the information \nwith which to autonomously compute the required maneuvers.\n\nExceptions to the time-scheduled execution of commands are satellite self- \nscheduled events (such as telemetry data collection) and geographically commanded \nrepetitive events. Telemetry is collected at ground commandable intervals. This is \nimplemented by placing a number in one of the hardware counters, and counting \ndown until the count reaches zero. At that instant, an interrupt occurs and causes the \nexecution of the repetitive event. The number is then reinserted into the counter so \nthat the process may be repeated.\n\n8.2.4  Housekeeping\n\nHousekeeping functions include maintenance of on-board hardware status, teleme-\ntry data collection and formatting, electric power system management, management \nof the thermal control system, ADACS status maintenance and ADACS telemetry \ndata collection.\n\nOn-board hardware status is maintained by a \u201cstate vector,\u201d telemetered to the \nground, where each bit indicates the status of a different hardware module, and \nwhether it is being used at this time or not. Onboard hardware status, if all compo-\nnents are functioning, is controlled by a default status vector that (for example) \nsignifies that User Downlink Transmitter No. 1 is used, that the C&DH and the \nADACS software are operating normally, that all batteries are on the line, that the \nthermal control system (heaters) are cycling with a duty cycle to maintain electron-\nics temperature at (say) 5\u00a0\u00b0 C, and that all deployables (activated by pyrotechnic \ndevices) have been fired.\n\n8.2.5  Management of\u00a0the\u00a0On-Board Electric Power System\n\nElectric Power System Management is performed in a number of different ways. \nBattery charging and controlling the charge regulators in accordance with the tem-\nperature and voltage of the batteries is performed by the \u201csmart\u201d electric power \nsubsystem in response to its own controller. The C&DH control of the power system \nincludes turning on or off various batteries, taking a battery off the line for condi-\ntioning, monitoring individual batteries for low voltage, taking the load off of these \nuntil they are recharged, and maintaining a battery watt-hour charge status for \ntelemetry to the ground to indicate battery status and the level of general battery \nusage over different parts of the world. In addition to control of the batteries, the \nC&DH control of the electric power system is also used to conserve electric power. \nIt determines the usage of individual PCB, turns them on or off depending on need, \n\n8 Spacecraft Software\n\n\n\n121\n\ncontrols the clock speed to slow it down when over ocean areas or when performing \nonly idle tasks. The spacecraft can also be commanded into Save Power mode by \nground command. Finally, should power become critical, the hardware will trigger \na low power condition and shed all unnecessary loads in an attempt to save the \nspacecraft. This computer control of the electric power system is a flight-proven \nfeature that has resulted in achievement of high power efficiencies.\n\n8.2.6  Management of\u00a0the\u00a0On-Board Thermal Control System\n\nBased on spacecraft telemetry, ground operators are provided with data about bat-\ntery temperatures. The operators may decide that the battery temperature should be \nincreased. Management of the Thermal Control System is implemented by control-\nling the temperature by cyclic, computer-controlled, operation of heaters. Instead of \nusing thermostats (that would put the vital battery heater system under the control \nof an automatic device whose failure could jeopardize the entire mission), the com-\nputer is used to turn on and off the heaters, with time-out on the duration of execu-\ntion of the heater commands. By controlling heater operation via the computer, \nmore precise and less power consuming heater control can be achieved.\n\n8.2.7  Telemetry Data Collection\n\nTelemetry data collection is performed by repetitive scheduling of the execution of \na \u201cstatus\u201d event at ground commanded or default schedule commanded repetition \nintervals. This event powers up the Analog I/Os, samples each of the analog and \nbinary telemetry points, feeds these values to a multiplexer and A/D converter for \ninput to the C&DH computer. In the C&DH, the sets of telemetry point values are \nstored, and telemetry statistics are updated. These are the minimum, maximum, \naverage and most recent values of all the telemetry point time histories. In this way, \nif only routine telemetry is required, the stored telemetry dump to the next ground \nstation has always the same number of data points, regardless of the time between \nground contacts, yet the data contains the important SOH statistics of every teleme-\ntered point. The default time interval between telemetry data collection instances is \ntypically quite long, so that 90 sets of samples cover one orbit.\n\nIf there is an anomaly, or the ground station operator wishes to examine a par-\nticular subsystem in more detail, he or she can command that specific subsystem to \ncollect and downlink telemetry from a specified time to another specified time with \na sample rate that can also be commanded. In this way, the Engineering Telemetry \ndata may contain much more granularity. Telemetry from ADACS, from the \nCommunications Processor and from the Propulsion System are downlinked and \ndisplayed in a similar manner.\n\n8.2 Performing Each Function or Module\n\n\n\n122\n\n8.2.8  Communications Software\n\nThe communications software is divided into up/down communications and on- \nboard message handling. While specific details of the communications protocol are \nusually a joint decision between the customer and the spacecraft builder, general \nconcepts of operation are described below. Since this spacecraft has multiple and \ndifferent store-forward communications functions, there are also different message \ntypes that must be serviced. Since communications involves a large number of \nsteps, Higher Level Commands are used to facilitate implementing \ncommunications.\n\nThe commands provided to the spacecraft by the ground control station are high \nlevel commands, interpreted by the spacecraft. For example, to communicate and \ncontact a ground station at time To using transmitter No. 2 and send data at 56\u00a0kbps \non frequency fo and time out after 10\u00a0 min is a single high level command. The \nspacecraft implements this command by turning on a TCXO oscillator at T0-X (to \npermit it to stabilize), connect the TCXO to transmitter number 2, turn on the B+ to \nnumber 2 at T0-Y, set up the protocol control software to transmit at 56\u00a0kbps, select \nthe modulator to be used, and select the first piece of data to be transmitted so that \nit would be ready for transmission when the transmitter key-on switch is turned on \nat T0. These high level commands generally follow the concept of implementing the \nanswers to a sequence of specifications about the action to be implemented, as a \nstructured set of instructions to When? What? and How? This high level, menu- \ndriven command structure has extensive flight history. Command confirmation \ntakes only a short time. It contrasts sharply with the older methods of controlling \nsatellites, where separate ground commands were needed to perform each switch or \nsetup function, and where each element of the command had to be repeated by the \nsatellite for confirmation by the ground before it was executed, thus limiting the \nnumber of (equivalent) high level commands that could be executed per unit time.\n\nMessage deliveries are attempted a predetermined number of times, and if they \nare undeliverable, they are recorded as undeliverable in the Communications \nHistory. Message responses not received within 2\u00a0seconds are retransmitted until \nthe retry count is exhausted. Once the retry count expires, no more messages are \nsent to that user on the current pass.\n\nThe major function of the processor associated with the command receiver is to \nrelieve the C&DH of all low level processing associated with frequency selection, \nreceiver tuning, decrypting, removing Forward Error Correction coding and mes-\nsage or command interpretations. The communication processor is only powered up \nby C&DH command. After the processor powers up, it notifies the C&DH that it is \nready for receiver frequency assignment. The C&DH sends the frequency, modula-\ntion type, data rate of the expected uplink command or message. The communica-\ntion processor programs the receiver to the specified frequency, initializes the digital \nhardware and DMA, and waits for the receiver squelch threshold to be exceeded. \nThe processor receives data until detection of packet termination. Only user packets \nreceived error free, i.e., have a valid CRC, are forwarded to the C&DH.\u00a0During \n\n8 Spacecraft Software\n\n\n\n123\n\npacket reception, the receive signal strength for each packet is monitored and \nappended to the packet that is forwarded to the C&DH.\u00a0The number of good and \nbad packets received are included in telemetry when requested by the C&DH.\u00a0The \nprocessor collects SOH information requested by the C&DH.\u00a0 SOH consists of \ninformation pertaining to the Executive, interprocessor communication errors, \ninvalid command or data transfers, and other miscellaneous information.\n\nThe communication processor program memory is divided between two types of \nstorage, Fuse Link ROM and Flash EPROM.\u00a0 The Fuse Link ROM contains the \nsoftware necessary to initialize the processor, communicate with the C&DH, and \nhouses critical software functions. The Flash EPROM contains two copies of the \nsoftware. When the communication processor is powered up and detects an unre-\ncoverable error condition, or is reset by the C&DH, it scans both copies of the \noperating system. The processor executes the most correct version. The communi-\ncation processor software is written in C with low level drivers or time critical por-\ntions of code written in assembly language.\n\n8.2.9  Attitude Control System Software\n\nFunctions performed by the ADACS were already described. Here, only those \naspects that propagate the orbit from GPS data are described. The on-board GPS \nprovides position (in ECEF coordinates), velocity and time information. First the \ncoordinates are converted to J2000 coordinates, then the spacecraft accelerations \nare double integrated to obtain position in the future, and thus the orbit is \npropagated.\n\n8.2.10  Uploadable Software\n\nFrom time to time, it may be necessary to change the way the on-board software \noperates. New software must be sent to the C&DH.\u00a0This is made easy by the fact \nthat the on-board software is organized as a set of independent modules, called into \nservice by the Idle Task sequencer. The executive addresses each module in turn. \nThis means that a new module can be sent up to the spacecraft and located anywhere \nthere is free memory space available. Only the pointer that causes the Idle Task to \ngo to the next module must be changed to point to the location of the new code. The \nC&DH should have the capability to update the code resident in Flash EPROM.\u00a0The \nsequence is initiated by the C&DH issuing a command to receive new software. The \nfunction that receives, stores, and programs the Flash EPROM resides in Fuse Link \nROM.\u00a0After all the software has been received, the C&DH commands to program \nthe Flash EPROMs. The C&DH then resumes normal operations using the new \nsoftware patch or subroutine.\n\n8.2 Performing Each Function or Module\n\n\n\n124\n\n8.2.11  Propulsion Control System Software\n\nCommands to the propulsion system are to provide a delta V burn through the CG \nof the spacecraft, using multiple thrusters. Since the net force of the thrusters misses \nthe CG by an undetermined small amount, providing a net thrust through the CG \ninvolves duty cycling the multiple thrusters and correcting the thrust error by chang-\ning the duty cycles in response to an attitude or rate sensor. Since the ADACS \nincludes an IMU, attitude errors are readily determined. The propulsion control \nsystem computes the length of the thrust required to produce a commanded delta \nV.\u00a0It does this from the tank pressure, using the ideal gas law. This time interval is \ndivided into many shorter intervals to apply to the thrusters. Then, the IMU is used \nto provide the input to the computer to determine which thrusters are to be fired for \nthese shorter time intervals to result in straight flight. When thrusting is initiated, the \nprocessor activates the shutoff valve to open gas flow from the fuel tank, measures \nthe gas pressure and temperature (a normal SOH measurement) and computes the \nduration of the burn from the gas law. If the required burn duration is longer than \n0.1s, the program computes the number of burns required so as not to upset the \nspacecraft due to any one burn being too long. Then, starting at the programmed \ntime, the set of short burns are executed by opening appropriate thruster valves for \nspecified durations of time. The time between burns is controlled by angular veloc-\nity, so that consecutive burns should result in opposing torques, resulting in mini-\nmum attitude error from the burn sequence.\n\n8.3  Software Development\n\nSoftware should be developed in an orderly manner with adherence to a set of prin-\nciples. The software should be:\n\n (a) Broken up into different modules, each of which performs one of  the func-\ntions described earlier in this chapter.\n\n (b) Each module should be described in full (defining the module requirements, the \ninputs to the module, the algorithm or logic the module will perform and the \noutputs of the module). This is usually called the pseudocode. The pseudocode \nmay also define the method of testing the code and the ICD (Interface Control \nDocument) for interfacing to the hardware.\n\n (c) From the pseudocode, the software can be reviewed before it is written to catch \nconceptual mistakes. Also, the size of the code (as Source Lines of Code\u00a0 - \nSLOC) can be estimated.\n\n (d) If not included in the pseudocode, separate ICD\u2019s should be written to define \ninterfaces between software and hardware modules.\n\n8 Spacecraft Software\n\n\n\n125\n\n (e) Based on whether this code is new or is reused from an earlier program, an \nestimate of the time to write the code can be made. Estimating programming \neffort depends on the assigned programmer\u2019s experience. For this reason, pro-\ngramming time estimated based on SLOC is, at worst, a WAG, and at best, it is  \nnot much better. The SLOC can also be estimated by comparing each module \nwith similar modules written in the past.\n\n (f) Software written should be archived regularly and should have a version number \nand date so it could be readily identified. Several good version control COTS \nsoftware are available.\n\n (g) Software progress reviews should be held frequently to determine progress and \nto identify incompatibilities or problems. If a software person tells you that he \nor she is almost finished, interpret this to mean that the software does not work.\n\n (h) Changing software modules is dangerous, if not rigorously controlled, and \ncould invalidate software written by another member of the team. For this rea-\nson, software changes should follow the Change Process (of writing down what \nthe change is, why it is made and what other part of the software will be affected \nby the change). There are several Change Control Systems (Subversion, Git) \nthat can establish and maintain the change control rigor.\n\n (i) The completed software modules should be tested under realistic situations.\n\n (j) While expensive, a complete software simulation of the spacecraft hardware \nshould be built. This enables testing the individual software modules as well as \nthe complete software system.\n\n (k) From the pseudocode, software should be written that can perform some (even \nif not all) the functions of each module. This permits an early testing of the \nentire system, verifying that the system as conceived will work. Later improve-\nments to the code will just make the system work better. This iteratively improv-\ning software development process is called the Spiral process (since the initial  \nsoftware spirals in toward the final software). The advantage of the  Spiral pro-\ncess is that it creates code very soon after starting the development process.\n\n8.3 Software Development\n\n\n\n127\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

The \nmain ones are (1) the launch vehicle payload envelope and interface separation sys-\ntem dimensions, (2) the launch vehicle loads to the spacecraft structure, (3) the \nweights of the spacecraft bus and payload components, (4) thermal design and abil-\nity to get rid of incident and internally generated heat, (5) the way solar arrays will \nbe mounted, deployed or rotated to provide the required Orbit Average Power, (6) \ninstrument pointing and (7) any other special requirements, such as the possible \nrequirement to keep propulsion, bus and payload separated from one another.\n\nThis section will go through the process of analyzing a typical spacecraft \nstructure with common-sense explanations for each step.\n\n9.1  Introduction\n\nDuring the launch sequence, the structure is exposed to a complex dynamic environ-\nment. It starts with the launch vehicle at rest on the pad with a 1\u00a0G vertical static \nload. At the moment that the rocket engines begin to fire, before the rocket begins to \nrise, the structure is exposed to severe vibration loads. Some of these are structure- \nborn, because engine vibrations pass through the launch vehicle, but a significant \nportion are acoustic, due to the engine sounds reflecting off the ground around the \nlaunch vehicle and impinging upon the spacecraft. There is a relationship between \nthe height of the launch vehicle and the acoustic loads on the spacecraft at the top of \nthe rocket. As the launch vehicle begins to rise, it accelerates slowly as a result of \nhaving to lift the high mass of the initial fuel. As the ground falls away, the reflected \nacoustic loads dissipate. As the velocity increases, the relatively dense air hitting the \nnose of the launch vehicle at lower altitudes, creates a dynamic pressure, \u201cQ\u201d, \ninducing a compressive load on the upper structure. It is common practice for the \nengines to be throttled back until sufficient altitude is reached, where the air density \nis less, to minimize the effects of this pressure. During this entire time, as fuel burns \n\n\n\n128\n\noff, the launch vehicle is getting lighter and acceleration increases for a given engine \nthrust. A typical axial acceleration profile for the Falcon 1 launch vehicle, given in \nFig.\u00a0 9.1, illustrates this sequence. It is noted that the peak axial acceleration of \n6.5\u00a0g\u2019s occurs at first stage separation.\n\nDuring this time, the spacecraft is attached (together with the other manifest \npayloads) to the launch vehicle, which has its own stiffness and mass. The complete \nassembly is subjected to dynamic loads over a large frequency range. The dynamic \nresponses of the launch vehicle and the manifested components couple with each \nother, producing a set of loads unique to that specific launch. In order to enable the \nanalysis during spacecraft design, estimated design loads are published by the \nlaunch vehicle supplier. These are conservative estimates of the loads the structure \nwill actually see. Depending upon the maturity of the launch vehicle/manifest, they \nmay be based on similar launch vehicles, actual measured values from previous \nlaunches, or coupled loads analysis (CLA) of the launch manifest. During the design \ncycle, additional CLA cycles may be performed, and the published loads updated. \nThe loads used for testing and to verify the structure are based on the latest loads \nestimates at the time of testing.\n\n9.2  Requirements Flow-Down and\u00a0the\u00a0Structure  \nDesign Process\n\nStructural Requirements are flowed down from the Launch Vehicle and from \nSpacecraft Requirements.\n\nLaunch Vehicle requirements are defined by the launch vehicle provider. \nTypically, they include:\n\n 1. Minimum Spacecraft Resonant Frequency: (typically 50\u00a0 Hz for a small \nsatellite): This is specified to avoid coupling with launch vehicle modes. In the \n\nFig. 9.1 Axial acceleration vs. time of the Falcon 1 launch vehicle\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n129\n\ncase of the ISS, there are additional requirements to preclude coupling with the \nStation\u2019s robotic arm modes. Finally, there may be on-orbit deployed configura-\ntion frequency requirements for instrument control and performance.\n\n 2. Static Loads: (provided by the launch vehicle) are based on estimates, past \nexperience, or Coupled Loads Analysis. These are conservatively estimated \nnumbers and take into account the coupled effects of the entire manifest and \nlaunch vehicle. Coupled Loads Analyses include uncertainty factors. These fac-\ntors are higher for the preliminary CLA at the beginning of a project, because the \ndesign and manifest are not finalized. By the final CLA, there are fewer vari-\nables, and the factors of safety used can be lower.\n\n 3. Sine Specification: (may or may not be required by the launch provider.) \nTypically, a sine spec may be a few G\u2019s in magnitude, in the 0 to 50 or 100\u00a0Hz \nfrequency range. It is intended to include the low frequency/high displacement \ndynamic loads on the spacecraft.\n\n 4. Random Loads: These loads include the higher frequency dynamic loads on the \nspacecraft. As a rule, the larger the spacecraft-instrument, the less the effect \nthese loads have. When a specific vibration spectrum is not available from the \nlaunch vehicle provider, the designer should begin with the General Environmental \nVerification Specification, GEVS, shown in Fig.\u00a09.2.\n\nFig. 9.2 (a) A launch vehicle random vibration spectrum (GEVS).  \n(b) Random vibration spectrum\n\n9.2  Requirements Flow-Down and\u00a0the\u00a0Structure Design Process\n\n\n\n130\n\n 5. Acoustic Loads: caused by acoustic pressure impingement, may be critical for \nlightweight items with large surface areas (solar arrays). An effective static pressure \ncan be calculated from the acoustic sound pressure, using Eq.\u00a09.1\n\n \n\nLp p Pref sound pressure dB where\n\np sound pressure P\n\n= ( ) ( )\n=\n\n?20 log / ,\n\naascal\n\nPref E reference sound pressure Pascal\n( )\n\n= ? = ( )\n,\n\n.\n\nand\n\n2 0 5\n \n\n(9.1)\n\n 6. Pressure Loads: propulsion systems, sealed and vented containers. Propulsion \nsystems have specific multi-tiered requirements, depending on the propellant \nused. A hazardous propellant, such as hydrazine, has higher safety requirements \nthan an inert propellant such as compressed nitrogen. Safety requirements also \ndepend on the contained energy of the propellant system. Fuel lines must be \nanalyzed for 4 times, and proof tested to 2 times maximum expected pressure. \nFor use near manned spacecraft, they require a \u201cleak before burst\u201d analysis to \ndemonstrate that, in the event of a crack, the crack will grow linearly to a length \nthat would allow the pressure to leak out before unstable crack growth will occur. \nPropellant tanks are typically proof tested to 1.5 times their Maximum Design \nPressure.\n\nSealed containers are volumes not vented during launch; they remain at one \natmosphere internal pressure on-orbit. Sealed containers must be qualified by \ntesting to two atmospheres internal pressure.\n\nVented container analysis consists of calculating how much vent area is \nrequired for a given enclosed volume. The venting pressure loads are calculated \nbased upon the maximum pressure decay rate and the ambient pressure during \nlaunch.\n\nNote: Pressure load requirements may be tiered based on the amount of \nenergy contained in the system.\n\n 7. Factors of Safety: (defined by the project)\n\n9.3  Structure Options, Their Advantages and\u00a0Disadvantages\n\nStructural configurations can vary from a simple box containing the spacecraft \nelectronics (several examples are shown in Fig.\u00a09.3) to a complex set of shapes that \ncontain or support the electronics, propulsion and various deployables, shown in \nFig.\u00a09.4.\n\nIf the spacecraft is small, almost any structural configuration will work. However, \nas the size of the structure and the weight of its electronics and payload grow to \nseveral hundred or more pounds, the placement of the electronics affects the strength \nrequired and the resulting resonant frequencies of the spacecraft. For instance, in \nFig.\u00a09.5a, the spacecraft structure consists of bottom and top plates, longerons and \nside panels.\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n131\n\nUnder the load of the electronics mounted to the inside of the side panels, the \nbottom plate will bend and vibrate. This can be mitigated by using corner braces. \nHowever, as shown in Fig.\u00a09.5b, by mounting the electronics to internal panels at or \nnear the separation system diameter, the load path will be straight and will permit \nreducing the thickness, strength and weight of not only the bottom plate but also the \nweight of the side panels. In addition, in Fig.\u00a09.5a solar incidence will heat the outer \npanels, which will create a difficult environment for the electronics, while in \nFig.\u00a09.5b the electronics is protected from direct solar heating.\n\nFig. 9.3 Simple box spacecraft structures\n\nPropulsion \nModule\n\nPayload\n\nDeployable \nSolar Panels\n\nBus\n\nFig. 9.4 A more complex spacecraft structure\n\n9.3  Structure Options, Their Advantages and\u00a0Disadvantages\n\n\n\n132\n\nIn selecting and designing the spacecraft structure and the layout of the elec-\ntronics, intuitive consideration must be given to the spacecraft stiffness, resonant \nfrequency and thermal performance even before undertaking a detailed analysis. \nThere are some \u201crules of thumb\u201d to aid in this process:\n\n\u2022 Avoid long, unsupported structural members\n\n \u2013 Include stiffeners, where possible, to avoid buckling\n \u2013 Stiffeners should be strong enough to support diagonal tension buckling of \n\nshear webs\n\n\u2022 Milled aluminum is strong and provides a good thermal path\n\n \u2013 Use materials that are resistant to Stress Corrosion Cracking per MSFC- \nSTD- 3029, \u201cGuidelines for the Selection of Metallic Materials for Stress \nCorrosion Cracking Resistance in Sodium Chloride Environments\u201d\n\n\u2022 Honeycomb panels feature high stiffness to weight ratios\n\n \u2013 Honeycomb face sheets may be metallic or composite\n \u2013 Carry high stress levels without buckling\n \u2013 Honeycomb core needs to be perforated to allow venting during launch\n \u2013 Handle acoustic pressure loads well\n \u2013 Require local inserts for bolt attachments\n \u2013 Composite face sheets may require an electrical barrier ply when used with \n\nsolar cells\n \u2013 May require additional testing to verify fabrication workmanship\n \u2013 Be sure to accommodate thermal expansion between materials\n\n\u2022 Use many screw fasteners\n\n \u2013 Fastener joints should be bearing critical (not shear critical)\n \u2013 Use high strength A-286 steel fasteners (avoid 300 series stainless bolts)\n \u2013 Cadmium plated fasteners are not permitted around manned spaceflight\n\nFig. 9.5 (a, b) Load paths in two different structures and two electronics mounting methods\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n133\n\n \u2013 Use self-locking inserts and nuts to attach bolts\n \u2013 Fasteners should be redundant to avoid single point failures\n\n\u2022 Graphite Epoxy structures are light and strong\n\n \u2013 Their coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) can be tailored for optical \napplications\n\n \u2013 Poor thermal or electrical conductors\n \u2013 May require additional testing to verify the workmanship of the composite layup\n \u2013 Higher manufacturing costs\n\n\u2022 Assure that there is a good thermal path to get rid of the heat\n\nAn example of a complex structure is the double satellite manifest launched by \nNASA in 2009 and shown in Fig.\u00a09.6.

(e) Four external structure modules comprise the LRO structure configuration\n\n9.3  Structure Options, Their Advantages and\u00a0Disadvantages\n\n\n\n134\n\nFig. 9.6 (continued)\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n135\n\nOrbiter (LRO) was launched atop the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing \nSatellite (LCROSS). LRO orbited the moon and mapped its surface. The LCROSS \nmission was to approach the moon. The upper stage then impacted the Moon and \nLCROSS flew through the ejecta looking for signs of water. The two vehicles were \nstacked for launch.\n\nThe LCROSS structure used an ESPA ring with components mounted radially \naround its perimeter. The upper flange of the ESPA ring supported the LRO space-\ncraft. Both spacecraft required large fuel tanks to supply thrust for lunar orbit \ninsertion.\n\nThe fuel tanks were located inside in LCROSS, and multiple components were \nmounted on the outside of the ring. From a structures load point of view, this pro-\nvided modularity to LCROSS and an efficient load path to support LRO.\n\nThe LRO was a 4-sided structure and consisted of 4 vertical honeycomb panels \ncontaining the LRO subsystems and instruments. The four vertical panels were \nmounted to a horizontal main deck, which interfaced with the LCROSS through the \nLaunch Vehicle Adaptor (LVA). The large fuel loads were carried through to the \nseparation system of LRO through the central structure (in a manner similar to the \nexample in Fig.\u00a09.5).\n\nThe alignment accuracy between the star trackers and the optical bench instru-\nments was critical for mission success. The composite bench material had a very \nlow CTE, thereby minimizing the thermal effects on pointing accuracy. The bench \nwas attached to the spacecraft using flexures to isolate deflections of the spacecraft \nfrom the optical bench. Alignment accuracy of other components on the spacecraft, \nsuch as solar arrays and high-gain antennae, were not as critical as those of the \noptical instruments.\n\nThis example of a complex spacecraft illustrates that use of direct load paths is a \ngood design practice.\n\nFig. 9.6 (continued)\n\n9.3  Structure Options, Their Advantages and\u00a0Disadvantages\n\n\n\n136\n\n9.4  Structure Materials and\u00a0Properties\n\nMachined aluminum, aluminum honeycomb and graphite epoxy laminates are com-\nmonly used structural materials (Fig.\u00a09.7).\n\nFig. 9.7 Typical metal material properties\n\nComposite materials have unique structural properties that can be tailored for \nspecific applications. While there are some very specialized composites for use in \nextreme environments, this discussion will focus on laminated composites. The \ntwo most common structural composites used on spacecraft are fiberglass and \ngraphite/epoxy (Gr/Ep). Both composites are assembled from fibers and an epoxy \nmatrix. Fiberglass has less strength than Gr/Ep, but its cost is relatively low and it \nis commonly used to provide thermal isolation. Gr/Ep structural composites come \nin two configurations: fabric and tape. The fabric versions use a graphite fabric, \nimpregnated with epoxy. While not quite isotropic, their strengths in both in-plane \naxes are similar. In the tape versions, the ply fibers run in one direction and they are \nimpregnated with epoxy. They are orthotropic and both their strength and \nCoefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) values vary dramatically with orienta-\ntion. Along their fiber axis, tape composites have extremely high strength and stiff-\nness and have very low (sometimes even negative) CTE.\u00a0Along axes normal to \ntheir fiber direction, where only the epoxy matrix carries the load, the plies are \nrelatively weak and have a higher CTE.\u00a0Because of the weakness in the tape off \naxis direction, tape laminates usually feature multiple plies at different angles to \ntailor the required strength for each axis. This tailoring requires that the laminate \nbe custom made, which is expensive.\n\nThe fact that the GrEp fibers have a negative CTE and the epoxy matrix has a \npositive CTE means that it is possible to design a composite laminate with near \nzero CTE.\u00a0This property is used extensively in on-orbit optical applications where \npointing must be maintained even with thermal gradients across the structure \n(Fig.\u00a09.8).\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n137\n\n9.5  Fasteners\n\nTypical English fastener sizes are given in Fig.\u00a09.9.\n\nFig. 9.8 Typical composite material properties\n\nFig. 9.9 English screw sizes\n\n9.5  Fasteners\n\n\n\n138\n\nNote: Tension areas are calculated taking plastic deformation at the thread \nsection into account, which makes them larger than the minimum thread diameter \nareas. The tensile areas should be used for calculating tensile stresses. If the \nthreads are in shear, the minor diameter areas should be used when calculating \nshear stresses.\n\nNote: If a fastener with an unthreaded section in shear is used, the diameter of the \nunthreaded section should be used for shear stress calculation.\n\n9.6  Factors of\u00a0Safety\n\nIn a spacecraft design, the required factors of safety are based on whether the \nstructure is strength tested or qualified by analysis only. If the added mass incurred \nby using \u201cNo-test\u201d factors is acceptable, time and cost can be saved by not running \na structural test program.\n\nStructures that include composite laminates usually require a structural test. This \nis because the strengths of composite laminates vary significantly, based on the \nquality of their manufacture. If multiple quantities of a composite laminate are pro-\nduced, each unit, most likely, requires testing for the same reason.\n\nTypical factors of safety used in the design are given in Fig.\u00a09.10. (different val-\nues may be specified by different projects.)\n\nFig. 9.10 Typical factors of safety table\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n139\n\nStatic load test on metallic structures: The main issue is whether a structural test \nwill be performed (allowing use of lower factors of safety). A structural test may be \nperformed using a static pull test (simplest and cheapest), but that may not test \nentire structure. A sine-burst vibration test (next cheapest) tests the entire structure. \nA centrifuge test (may require multiple test cycles at various orientations), is the \nmost expensive.\n\nRandom/Acoustic: If using the acceptance level loads, random/acoustic factors \nof 1.6 yield and 1.8 ultimate must be used. If qualification loads (acceptance +3\u00a0dB) \nare used, factors of 1.25 yield and 1.4 ultimate should be used for margin of safety \ncalculations.\n\nStability: The factor ensures that the structure does not buckle below the ulti-\nmate stress levels.\n\nThermal Stresses: a thermal vacuum test allows use of lower tested factors.\nEVA kick Loads and nominal EVR operations: Typically not tested; therefore \n\nthey carry higher no-test factors.\nEVR Impact: This is considered an unplanned failure mode. Therefore; the \n\nstructure may be damaged (hence no yield requirement) but must remain intact.\nFail-Safe: This is typically used for bolted joints. It must be shown that the joint \n\nwill remain intact and carry the full load when the highest loaded fastener has failed.\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n9.7.1  Structural Analysis Overview\n\nThe purposes of the Structural Analyses are:\n\n\u2022 To determine if the spacecraft structure is strong enough to withstand vibra-\ntional, acoustic and static loads during launch to orbit\n\n\u2022 To determine if the deformation of the structure during ascent to orbit is small \nenough to meet structure and payload deformation criteria\n\n\u2022 To determine if the resonant frequencies are high enough to meet launch vehicle \nrequirements\n\n\u2022 To determine the critical stress levels in the structure, and where they are located\n\u2022 To determine where the structure needs to be strengthened and where it could be \n\nmade lighter\n\u2022 To determine the equivalent G loads induced by random and acoustic loads.\n\u2022 To determine whether the stiffness (modes) and thermal distortion are acceptable \n\nfor on-orbit instrument performance\n\nThe main tool for performing the above analyses is the Finite Element Model \n(FEM). It is a mathematical model constructed from CAD drawings of the space-\ncraft, its electronics and payload. It is used to provide outputs that answer the above \nquestions. Methods of constructing the FEM will be discussed later.\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n140\n\nAfter the FEM is constructed, the analysis sequence is:\n\n 1. Run the FEM model to determine the resonant modes (solution of an Eigenvalue \nproblem). This results in the resonant mode frequencies and the amount of the \nspacecraft mass that participates in each mode.\n\n 2. Run the Static Loads to determine whether the structure has the required strength.\n 3. Conduct a Sine vibration analysis to simulate the low frequency/high displace-\n\nment response of the spacecraft structure during launch. The excitation is applied \nby driving the model at the spacecraft-launch vehicle interface in each axis \nseparately.\n\n 4. Run a random vibration analysis, with the excitation at the spacecraft-launch \nvehicle interface, to simulate the higher frequency responses during launch. In \nthis analysis the spacecraft is exposed to all the vibrations that it will experience \nduring launch. If different modes couple to each other to create large deflections, \nthis analysis will produce these modes. One of the purposes of the random vibra-\ntion test is to obtain accelerations over the entire frequency spectrum and then \ncalculate from these an effective static acceleration that can be used in further \nanalyses. This analysis is run in each axis separately.\n\n9.7.2  Structural Analysis Steps in\u00a0Detail\n\nThe analysis is performed using a Finite Element Model (FEM), based on the \nspacecraft\u2019s CAD model. The FEM can be created automatically from the CAD \nmodel or the geometry can be entered manually using points, lines and solids. This \ngeometry can then be used to create structural elements.\n\nThe choice of how to construct the FEM model depends on the maturity of the \nmechanical design. If it is the final configuration, the fastest procedure may be to \ncreate a model by auto-meshing the geometry file. However, if the design is prelimi-\nnary, and changes are expected, a finite element model (FEM) should be constructed \nthat can easily accommodate changes. Using plate and bar elements allows making \nchanges to the FEM quickly, permitting rapid design iteration.\n\n 1. Creation of Finite Element Model (FEM)\n\nA finite Element Model is a mathematical simulation of the structure. It is composed \nof a stiffness and a mass matrix which can be used to calculate the natural frequen-\ncies, distribution of loads, and stresses within the structure. Software from many \nsources is available today for creating, solving, and post processing finite element \nmodel results. Their prices and capabilities vary significantly. Some capabilities \ninclude:\n\n 1. Graphic model creation (creating/meshing FEM from CAD models)\n 2. Frequency analysis (eigenvalues)\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n141\n\n 3. Static Load stress analysis\n 4. Sine Load stress analysis\n 5. Random vibration base-drive analysis\n 6. Design optimization\n 7. Graphic post processing of results\n\nThree steps are involved in performing a FEM analysis:\n\n 1. Create a model and use it to create a data deck file. (A data deck file is an ASCII \ntext file which includes model information and a case control section to tell the \ncomputer what analysis to run)\n\n 2. Solve the data deck file (the stiffness and mass matrices in the deck are processed \nfor the desired solution)\n\n 3. Take the analysis results and map them back to the model to display the results \n(examples: animated plot, deformed plot, stress contour plot).\n\nThe FEM can also be created by hand or from a CAD model of the design. Most \nprograms (such as FEMAP) can create a solid element FEM from a solid CAD \nmodel. The FEM program will assign a default mesh size, based upon the geometry \nof the CAD model being meshed. There are a few considerations to note when using \nan auto-meshed FEM:\n\nIf the FEM model has a very fine mesh, it may take a long time to run analysis \nsolutions. As personal computers have become faster and more powerful, this has \nbecome less of a concern for static runs, but dynamic solutions can still end up tak-\ning many hours. Most auto-meshing routines allow one to override the default mesh \nsize for a component. In order to reduce the size and run times of the FEM, input a \nlarger mesh size than the default size. Most models take only seconds to mesh. If the \ninput mesh size is too large, the software will not be able to mesh the CAD geom-\netry. By changing the mesh size input, one can quickly iterate to the largest mesh \nsize that can be processed, thereby reducing the size of the FEM.\n\nOne major weakness of auto-meshed solid models is that they are difficult to \nedit. Every time the design changes, a new model must be created. Even though \nauto-meshing the structure is fast, the fastener elements and boundaries must still be \nrecreated. If a final design is analyzed, this may be less of an issue.\n\nA FEM can also be created by importing the CAD geometry into the FEM soft-\nware and creating a structural model on top of the imported geometry. While this \nmethod takes longer than auto-meshing, it gives the analyst complete control over \nthe size of the elements. They can be tailored to have a finer mesh in critical areas \nto calculate stress gradients, and a larger mesh in less critical areas, to minimize the \nsize of the model. Also, the hand meshed model can be easily modified when mak-\ning changes to the design.\n\nAn initial CAD model is shown at the left, Auto-meshed and Hand-meshed mod-\nels are shown at the right in Fig.\u00a09.11.\n\nRegardless of the software used, the steps used in creating a model are similar, \nand the sequence is intuitive.\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n142\n\nElement mesh size \nwas defined on lines \n\nbefore extruding\n\nFig. 9.12 Manually input elements and elements created from geometry\n\nFig. 9.13 Example of element property input\n\n 2. Defining the Element Geometry\n\nWhen creating a model by hand, as shown in Fig.\u00a09.12, the geometry is created \nusing points and lines that can be manipulated (extruded, revolved, rotated, copied) \nto create the elements.\n\nFig. 9.11 Model creation method comparison\n\n 3. Defining Material and Element properties\n\nThe properties of each material are entered. A separate material card is used for each \nmaterial used (the software may have material databases that can be loaded into \nmaterial cards). Figures\u00a0 9.13 and 9.14 illustrate entering element properties and \nmaterials into the model.\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n143\n\nFig. 9.14 Example of material property input\n\n 4. Elements to Model Joints and Attachments\n\nThree types of elements are used to attach components and may be used to calculate \nloads for later joint analysis. The first two are rigid elements (RBE2 & RBE3). An \nRBE2 rigidly attaches dependent and independent nodes. In an RBE3, the depen-\ndent node\u2019s displacement is the average of the motions of the independent nodes, \nwithout rigidly attaching the independent nodes to each other. The third  element \ntype for attaching nodes is a CBUSH element. Figure\u00a0 9.15 illustrates the FEM \nmodel displays when creating CBUSH elements.\n\nFig. 9.15 Example of CBUSH property and element cards\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n144\n\nFig. 9.16 Example of mass element and RBE3 rigid element cards\n\n 5. Adding Masses and Non-Structural Mass\n\nTwo methods are used for attaching a mass to a FEM.\u00a0For a simple electronics box, \nthe box can be modeled as a concentrated mass, using a rigid element to attach it to \nits mounting bolt locations. In this case, the RBE3 should be used. An RBE2 would \nrigidize all the mounting bolt locations, thereby reinforcing them by creating a false \nload path. Using an RBE3 attaches the box\u2019s mass, but does not reinforce the struc-\nture. This is illustrated in Fig.\u00a09.16.\n\nMass can also be added to a model as Non-Structural Mass. In a solar array, the \nmass of the solar cells and wiring can be smeared over the array\u2019s surface by input-\nting NSM in the property card.\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n145\n\nFig. 9.17 Machined aluminum deck with electronics components modeled using  \nconcentrated masses and RBE3 rigid element attachments\n\n 6. Defining Boundary Constraints\n\nThe typical model is constrained using Single Point Constraints (SPC\u2019s) to define \nwhich model nodes are constrained. In Fig.\u00a09.17 the model is constrained at four \nlocations (two on the front panel and two on the rear panel) (Figs.\u00a09.18 and 9.19)\n\nFig. 9.18 Plate property card used to define a honeycomb solar array panel  \n(with aluminum face sheets)\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n146\n\nFig. 9.20 Attaching spacecraft mounting interface locations to a single node for analyses, \nrequiring a base drive (sine and random)\n\nWhile this method works well for static and eigenvalue solutions, it does not \nwork in sine or random analyses solutions where the model must be driven from a \nsingle node. For sine and random analysis, an RBE2 rigid element can be used to \nattach the model\u2019s interface mounting locations to a single node. In this case, all the \ninterface locations should be rigid in relation to each other so an RBE2 is used \ninstead of an RBE3 (Fig.\u00a09.20).\n\n 7. Lowest Resonant Frequency (Eigenvalue Analysis) Requirement\n\nOnce the FEM is created, the eigenvalue (modal) solution is usually run first. The \neigenvalue run calculates the natural frequency modes of the FEM.\u00a0It is also useful \nas a model check. If the first vibrational mode of the structure is very low (less \nthan, say, 0.001\u00a0Hz), it is probably caused by one of two factors: the model may not \nbe properly constrained at its boundaries, or an element is not properly attached. \nThis will become very evident when looking at the animated or deformed mode \nshapes. If it looks like the entire model translates wildly when animated, it is prob-\nably an issue with the constraints. If it looks like a specific component is moving \n\nSPC\u2019s showing DOF\u2019s \nconstrained\n\n(two additional SPC\u2019s on \nback Face)\n\nFig. 9.19 Example of single point constraints\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n147\n\nFig. 9.21 Vibrational mode exhibiting the lowest resonant frequency\n\nFig. 9.22 Modal effective weight table for first ten modes\n\nwildly, the component is probably not attached properly. An example of the \ndeformed shape of the structure is shown in Fig.\u00a09.21. The modal effective weights \nof each mode can also be calculated during an eigenvalue run. The modal effective \nweight summary lists the frequency of each mode and how much of the total mod-\nel\u2019s mass is participating. It is common practice to consider any mode where more \nthan 5% of the model\u2019s mass participates as a primary mode (Fig.\u00a09.22).\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n148\n\nFig. 9.23 Example of body loads (accelerations)\n\nFig. 9.24 Example of nodal load types\n\nAt this point, the FEM has not been correlated to test data. While it should be \nrelatively accurate at low frequencies, it may be significantly inaccurate above 500\u00a0Hz.\n\n 8. Static Analysis\n\nOnce an eigenvalue solution has run successfully, running static solutions is the next \nstep. The elements and constraints for the static run are the same as those for the \neigenvalue run. Most FEM software support the creation of a variety of applied \nstatic loads. Examples of body, nodal and elemental load types are shown in \nFigs.\u00a09.23, 9.24 and 9.25.\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n149\n\nFig. 9.25 Example of elemental load types\n\nFig. 9.26 Example of stress contour plot\n\nOnce the loads and constraints have been applied, a static solution can be run to \ncalculate, loads, displacements and stresses. The stresses can then be used to calcu-\nlate margins of safety (Fig.\u00a09.26).\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n150\n\nFig. 9.27 Example of sine solution NASTRAN data deck\n\n 9. Sine Analysis\n\nSine analysis is a base-driven dynamic load case. It may or may not be required by a \nlaunch provider. It simulates the low frequency/high displacement portion of the \nlaunch environment. While the input levels may seem low, if the frequency range \nincludes any of the spacecraft primary modes, the response levels may be significant, \ndepending upon the load amplification of the design. The results from a sine analysis \nare response load/displacements versus frequency. The response load values can be \napplied to the spacecraft FEM as a static load to calculate stresses and deflections.\n\nOne of the reasons for running a sine test on a spacecraft is that it simulates the \ndeflections of the structure at the low frequency/high displacement range. There \nhave been cases where restraint systems and latches have actually deployed during \nsine tests due to excessive manufacturing tolerances (Fig.\u00a09.27).\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n151\n\n 10. Random Vibration Analysis\n\nRandom analysis is also a base-driven dynamic load case. It is used to simulate the \nhigher frequency portion of the launch environment. Random analysis is the only \nanalysis where the spacecraft is exposed to all its modal frequencies at the same \ntime. Modes may couple with each other, creating very high responses. The purpose \nof the random vibe analysis is to calculate an effective static acceleration and to \nassess the modal responses over the entire launch frequency spectrum to exhibit \nmodes with high responses (Fig.\u00a09.28).\n\nFig. 9.28 Example of random solution NASTRAN data deck\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n152\n\nThe results from the random run include a punch file and an F06 file. The punch \nfile contains the response frequency vs. G2/Hz data, and it can be graphed. The F06 \nfile contains the GRMS values of the energy under the graphed punch file curve. Both \nvalues are 1-sigma levels. The accepted procedure is that the structure is analyzed \nusing 3-sigma GRMS levels as a static load. The 3-sigma accelerations in each axis \nare applied simultaneously to calculate stresses. Figure\u00a09.29 illustrates a 1-sigma \nresponse for a 10 GRMS input\n\nFig. 9.29 Example of 1-sigma response curves for 10.0 grms acceptance level X-Input\n\nFrom the response shown in the table above, the component at node 3 should be \nanalyzed, using a 3-Sigma static acceleration load of:\n\n Gx G s= \u00d7 = ?3 16 83 50 49. .  \n\n Gy G s= \u00d7 = ?3 7 13 21 39. .  \n\n Gz G s= \u00d7 = ?3 20 75 62 25. .  \n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n153\n\nWhen choosing node locations to calculate responses, take into account the \neffective mass at the location. For example, a location at the center of a web will reso-\nnate at its own natural frequency at some point over the random analysis frequency \nrange. This resonance may create very high response levels, but the active mass of the \nweb is negligible, and the stresses induced by the resonance are insignificant.\n\n 11. Fastener Analysis\n\nFastener loads can be calculated easily by the FEM using rigid elements (RBE2, \nRBE3) and scaler spring (CBUSH) elements. When using rigid elements, request-\ning a grid point force balance (GPFB) at the constrained node will produce a listing \nof all the forces acting on the node. The MPCFORCE load will be the load from the \nRBE.\u00a0For scaler spring elements, requesting the element forces will calculate the \nforces in the CBUSH elements.\n\nOnce the forces are calculated, fastener margins are usually calculated by hand. \nFastener shear and tensile stresses can be calculated using the fastener area values \nshown in Fig.\u00a09.9. From these stresses, principal stresses can be calculated and used \nto produce margins of safety. Margins of safety are calculated for tension (yield and \nultimate) as well as shear (ultimate).\n\nFastener margins can also be calculated taking the bolted joint stiffness into \naccount. When the fastener is tightened (torqued), it is normally preloaded to \napproximately 65% of yield stress. This preload creates compression in the bolted \njoint. When the joint is loaded, part of the load is carried by the fastener and part is \ncarried by the preloaded joint components. There are spreadsheets available on the \nweb for calculating bolted joint margins based on joint stiffness.\n\nAlthough bearing stress margins are not presented as commonly as fastener mar-\ngins, understanding bearing stress is important when analyzing fastener patterns. \nBearing stress is calculated by dividing the fastener shear load by the area of the \nhole that it is installed in.\n\n \n\nBearing stress f P d t where P is the fastener shear loadbearing= = ( )?/ ,,\n       d is its diameter and t is the thickness on the thin side of thee joint  \n\nWhen the hole at the highest loaded fastener in a fastener pattern yields in \nbearing, the hole elongates, but continues to carry load. This yielding redistributes \nthe joint load among the adjacent fasteners, thereby allowing the joint to carry a \nhigher load before joint failure occurs.\n\nAnother mechanism for redistributing fastener loads is fastener yield, when the \nfasteners themselves yield and redistribute the load to adjacent fasteners in the \npattern. It is always desirable to use a fastener material with a large range between \nthe yield and ultimate stress allowables. If the yield allowable is close to the ulti-\nmate allowable, the fastener will be brittle. If the brittle fastener fails, its load is \nsuddenly passed onto the adjacent fastener. This sudden load may cause the adjacent \nfastener to fail, beginning a chain reaction where the bolted joint unzips, causing \ncatastrophic failure.\n\n9.7  Structural Analyses\n\n\n\n154\n\nTwo of the most commonly used fastener materials are high strength A286 steel \nand 300 series corrosion resistant steel (CRES):\n\nA286 high strength steel: Fty\u00a0=\u00a0120,000\u00a0psi and Ftu\u00a0=\u00a0160,000\u00a0psi\n300 Series CRES: Fty\u00a0=\u00a030,000\u00a0psi and Ftu\u00a0=\u00a080,000\u00a0psi\n\nA-286 high strength steel comes in heat treats where Ftu is greater than \n160,000\u00a0psi. Their yield strengths are closer to their ultimate strengths; however, \nthey are more brittle and are not commonly used for flight structures.\n\n9.8  Weight Estimate\n\nEstimating and updating the weight of a spacecraft should be done regularly and \naccurately during development. It is essential to not exceed the spacecraft weight \nagreed to with the launch vehicle supplier, and to meet the CG location require-\nments in the XY plane. Typically, the CGXY should be within 0.25? of the separation \nsystem axial centerline. A CGXY location error will cause spacecraft tipoff (rotation \nin the XZ and YZ planes).\n\nThe procedure for accurately estimating spacecraft weight, Center of Gravity \nand Pitch or Roll Moments of Inertia are outlined below. Create a spreadsheet:\n\n\u2022 List all of the spacecraft parts and components\n\u2022 State the weight of each\n\u2022 Apply weight margins to each part\n\n \u2013 2% if the part exists, was weighed or if a vendor specification of the part exists\n \u2013 10% if the weight of the part was computed\n \u2013 20% if the weight is estimated\n\n\u2022 Compute the margined weight of each part\n\u2022 Determine the XYZ location of the part CG in the spacecraft coordinate \n\nsystem\n\u2022 Determine the component moments (weight*location) in all 3 coordinates about \n\nthe origin of the spacecraft coordinate system\n\u2022 Determine the spacecraft CG in each of the 3 coordinates\n\n(Sum the component moments in each coordinate Divide the 3 sums by the \nspacecraft margined weight)\n\n\u2022 Compute the Pitch/Roll Moment of Inertia of the spacecraft\n\n \u2013 For each component compute its inertia, W/g*(Z-ZCG)2\n\n \u2013 Sum the inertias in each coordinate\n \u2013 Divide the three sums by the spacecraft margined mass.\n\nThis process is illustrated for a 20?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036? spacecraft consisting of (1) a \nPropulsion Module, (2) an Electronics Module and (3) a Payload Module, as shown \nin Fig.\u00a09.30.\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n155\n\nFig. 9.30 Spacecraft for which the weight statement is constructed\n\nThe spreadsheet implementing the process described above is shown in Fig.\u00a09.31. \nThe origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the Top Plate, and Z is positive \ngoing down\n\nThe spacecraft CG is 12.928? from the top. Its Moment of Inertia is 1.4299 \nslug- ft2 (1.910 kg-m2). In the XY plane, the CG is off the center by 0.389? in X and \n0.379? in Y.\u00a0Thus, the CG is 0.543? from the XY plane center. It does not meet the \nlaunch vehicle specifications that the CG should be within 0.25? of the center. \nFor this reason, the locations of some of the spacecraft components should be \nmoved in the XY plane.\n\nThe weight distribution of the spacecraft among its various subsystems is shown \nin Fig.\u00a09.32.\n\nThe difference between CGZ and Center of Pressure is 5.072?. This is large \nenough that at low altitudes (500\u00a0km) atmospheric drag will try to tip the spacecraft, \nand this has to be compensated by a more frequent unloading of built up momentum \nin the reaction wheels. At altitudes above 600\u00a0km, this effect is very small and \nprobably negligible.\n\n9.8  Weight Estimate\n\n\n\n156\n\nF\nig\n\n. 9\n.3\n\n1 \nW\n\nei\ngh\n\nt s\nta\n\nte\nm\n\nen\nt\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n157\n\nF\nig\n\n. 9\n.3\n\n1 \n(c\n\non\ntin\n\nue\nd)\n\n9.8  Weight Estimate\n\n\n\n158\n\nF\nig\n\n. 9\n.3\n\n1 \n(c\n\non\ntin\n\nue\nd)\n\n9 Spacecraft Structure\n\n\n\n159\n\nSpacecraft Weight Distribution\n\n26.4, 24.9%\n\n2.4, 2.3%\n\n1.6, 1.5%\n\n21.9, 20.7%\n\n2.8, 2.6%\n\n9.6, 9.1%\n\n19.5, 18.4%\n\n21.7, 20.5%\n\nStructure\nPropulsion\nEPS\nDigital\nADACS\nCommunications\nHarnessing\nPayload\n\nFig. 9.32 Weight distribution among various subsystems\n\n9.8  Weight Estimate\n\n\n\n161\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

These may \ninclude solar panels, antennas, gravity gradient booms and various other booms and \ninstruments of the payload. There are two main rules for designing deployables.\n\nFirst, one must be sure that in the stowed state, launch vehicle vibrations should \nnot permit separation of any part of the deployable from the spacecraft. This \ndemands that at each point of the deployable where it touches the spacecraft, the \ndeployable should be secured to the spacecraft with a force greater than the weight \nof the deployable times the launch vehicle acceleration. If the force is insufficient, \nduring vibration testing, the deployable will \u201cchatter,\u201d and it may be damaged.\n\nThe second rule is that during deployment, the force should be sufficient to reini-\ntiate deployment after the deployable has been stopped. One should not rely on the \ninertia of the deployable to continue deployment. There should be a positive force \nacting on the deployable at all times.\n\nDesign practices for deployables are many. Some are listed below:\n\n\u2022 Whenever possible, two surfaces that must slide relative to one another should \nuse rollers to minimize friction\n\n\u2022 Use space qualified lubricants or dry lubricants\n\u2022 Avoid the use of dissimilar materials in contact with one another\n\u2022 Design to preclude metal-to-metal adhesion\n\u2022 Analyze the behavior of moving parts under a large temperature span\n\u2022 Ensure that the deploying force or torque should have a large safety margin\n\u2022 Use dampers to avoid unbounded accelerations during deployment\n\u2022 If detents or latches are used, assure that slight overdeployment is used to permit \n\nlatches to engage\n\u2022 If assurance is required (in telemetry) that deployment has actually taken place, \n\nit could significantly complicate the mechanism\n\n\n\n162\n\n10.1  Deployment Devices\n\nThere are several different deployment and release devices.\n\n10.1.1  Hinges\n\nFigure 10.1 shows a typical hinge used to deploy solar panels initially held fixed to \nthe sides of the spacecraft, and then deployed to some angle (say 30\u00b0) when on orbit. \nThe hinge uses a coiled spring on a shaft. When deployed, there is still positive \ntorque to keep the panel in the deployed state. The red plate is used to determine the \ndeployment angle (a 30\u00b0 deployment hinge is shown). The deployed spring residual \ntorque must be large enough to overcome any on-orbit loads.\n\nAlternatively, instead of using the residual torque to keep the hinge deployed, \ndetents or latches can also be used. When using detents, the design should allow for \na slightly greater than required deployment angle so that as the hinge deploys, it \noverrides the hole designed for the detent, thereby assuring detent penetration into \nthe hole. One disadvantage of using detents is that the deployed structure may expe-\nrience \u201cplay\u201d due to the tolerances of holes and detents.\n\nFig. 10.1 Spring loaded hinge to deploy from 0\u201330\u00b0\n\n10.1.2  Deployable Booms\n\nDeployable booms, like a gravity gradient boom or an expending structure, require \nlight weight and stiff structural elements that stow in very small spaces and deploy \nto great lengths. A good example of such booms is the gravity gradient boom which \nmust often deploy to some 50\u00a0 ft or more and, when stowed, fit in just a small \ncanister.\n\nDeveloped in the early 1960\u2019s, the Stem and Bistem booms were used to create \nlong structures stowed in small initial volumes. Figure\u00a010.2 illustrates the Stem and \nBistem mechanisms. In both, the flat spring material is curled along its longitudinal \n\n10 Deployment Mechanisms\n\n\n\n163\n\naxis. It straightens out when wound up on a spool. When allowed to unwind from \nthe spool, the spring assumes it original curled state to create a round boom. The \nStem boom can be quite rigid, but torsionally indeterminate. The Bistem uses two \ndeployed booms, one inside the other.\n\nFig. 10.2 Stem and bistem deployable booms\n\nLater, stiffer deployable structures were developed. Two deployable boom \nstructures are shown. In Fig.\u00a010.3a, two pre-bent flat springs are welded together to \nform a stiff tube. The tube is squashed to become a flat spring, which is then rolled \nonto a drum. When deploying from the drum, the squashed tube resumes its origi-\nnal shape. This makes for a very stiff boom. Since often the Sun will shine on one \nof the springs and not on the other, the boom will experience thermal bending. To \nmitigate this, holes are drilled into the flat springs so that sunshine incident on one \nside can get through the holes and impinge on the other spring also, keeping the \nboom straight.\n\nIn Fig.\u00a010.3b, a \u201cstacer\u201d boom is shown. Here, when the flat beryllium spring is \nstowed, it is coiled up like a roll of postage stamps. Since the spring is coiled at \n(typically) 60\u00b0 angle, the spring will try to deploy axially from the canister where it \n\n10.1  Deployment Devices\n\n\n\n164\n\nis stowed. For this reason, the spring is held stowed by an internal (kevlar) line, \nwhich is cut with a line cutter when deployment is initiated. The same line with a \nconstant force spring and a governor are used to control deployment. The internal \nstring also prevents over-deployment and the unwinding of consecutive layers of the \nspring. Thermal bending is also an issue with this design, but the beryllium flat \nspring is a good thermal conductor, so bending is minimized. Testing the deployable \nboom on Earth can be difficult. In Fig.\u00a010.3c, the tip of the boom is secured to a \npiece of ice, and the boom is deployed horizontally on a smooth floor. Thus, deploy-\nment in space at zero g and no friction is simulated with good results.\n\n10.1.3  Large Deployable Antennas\n\nFor low power space-to-ground communications from geostationary altitude, the \nspacecraft antenna must be very large. To be compatible with the spacecraft, the \nstowed antenna configuration and the overall weight of the antenna and deployment \nmechanism should both be small. These seem like incompatible requirements. \nNevertheless, the art of designing ever larger spacecraft antennas seems to be in \ngood health, with novel ideas emerging frequently.\n\nOne of the early types of large deployable antennas consisted of articulated webs \ninterconnected with a thin metal mesh, shown in Fig.\u00a010.4.\n\nFig. 10.3 (a\u2013c)Two different deployable boom configurations\n\n10 Deployment Mechanisms\n\n\n\n165\n\nOther approaches have also been developed. In one of these, the ribs are wound \nup in a drum and when deployed, they straighten out and drag the metal mesh with \nthem. In another, the outer diameter is constructed from an inflatable tube, and the \nsurface is either a mesh or a diaphragm.\n\nThe reader is referred to the references for more detailed information about large \ndeployable antennas.\n\n10.2  Restraint Devices\n\nExplosive bolt cutters or line cutters, explosive bolts, electric burn wires, paraffin \nactuators, solenoid pin pullers and motorized cams are used to keep the deployables \nstowed on orbit.\n\n10.2.1  The Explosive Bolt Cutter\n\nThe explosive bolt cutter is perhaps the most frequently used restraining device, \nshown in Fig.\u00a010.5. This device uses redundant pyrotechnic initiators that ignite the \ncharge. The charge then drives the cutter forward to cut the bolt. Bolts of 6\u201332? to \n\nFig. 10.4 Articulated rib with metal mesh ATS-6 antenna\n\n10.2  Restraint Devices\n\n\n\n166\n\n0.25? are commonly cut by such bolt cutters. While the cutters are relatively inex-\npensive, the reader is cautioned that a large number of cutters must be purchased to \nprovide samples for lot qualification and testing. The pyro shock generated by these \ncutters must be taken into account in the design of the nearby spacecraft structure \nand electronics.\n\n10.2.2  Electric Burn Wires\n\nThe electric burn wire is a device where a short piece of nichrome wire is wrapped \naround a Kevlar or Vectran line, and when current is applied to the wire, it burns the \nline and releases whatever is held taut by the line. Its main advantage is that it is not \na pyrotechnic device. The relationships between the wire gauge, wire tensile strength \nand the current needed to burn the line are in Fig.\u00a010.6.\n\nFig. 10.5 Explosive bolt cutter (Ensign Bickford)\n\nGauge lbs Burn\u00b0C Min Amp\nOhm \n(1\")\n\nMin \nVolt/inch\n\n38 0.628 1350 0.846 3.5167 2.975\n36 0.982 1350 1.182 2.2500 2.661\n34 1.559 1350 1.673 1.4167 2.370\n32 2.513 1350 2.387 0.8833 2.109\n30 3.927 1350 3.345 0.5625 1.881\n28 6.234 1350 4.731 0.3542 1.676\n26 9.928 1350 6.706 0.2225 1.492\n24 15.865 1350 9.533 0.1392 1.327\n22 25.136 1350 13.425 0.0883 1.186\n\nFig. 10.6 Nichrome (1?) burn wire cutting 65 lbs. Vectran line\n\n10 Deployment Mechanisms\n\n\n\n167\n\nAs the required tensile strength of the nichrome wire increases, the current \nrequired to burn the line increases substantially. For this reason, the burn wire \nrelease mechanism is best suited to the release of small devices. The length of \ntime for burning the line is several seconds, so if multiple releases are required, \nthe exact instance of the releases cannot be ensured. For this reason, the release \nof the spacecraft deployable should be insensitive to the exact time of the \nrelease.\n\nSince the nichrome wire melting point in space is less than it is at ambient pres-\nsure, care must be taken not to overheat the nichrome wire and cause it to melt.\n\nThere are two design approaches to burn wire separation systems. In one, the \nnichrome wire is in tension by the line. In this type, the maximum line tension is the \ntensile strength of the nichrome wire. In the other type, the nichrome wire is wrapped \naround the line. In this design, line tension is not dependent on the nichrome wire \nbreak strength. Both types are shown in Fig.\u00a010.7.\n\nFig. 10.7 Two different types of burn wire systems\n\n10.2.3  Solenoid Pin Pullers\n\nA solenoid, when energized, pulls a pin that holds the restrained structure. When the \npin is pulled, the restrained structure is free to move. While this pin puller appears \nto be simple, because of the friction between the pin and the surrounding housing, a \nsurprising amount of force is needed to pull the pin. The solenoids tend to be large \nand require a lot of current.\n\n10.2  Restraint Devices\n\n\n\n168\n\n10.2.4  Paraffin Pin Pushers\n\nParaffin is a wax that, when heated, can increase its volume up to 25% over a tem-\nperature range of 30\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0F.\u00a0This is used to push out a pin from an enclosed cylin-\nder. Figure\u00a010.8 shows the principle of these actuators, and the stroke and force of \nthree different Rostra Vernatherm actuators. The advantages of the paraffin actua-\ntors are that they are small, provide a lot of force and are reusable.\n\nLOAD\n\nLOADSTROKE\n\nPI\nST\n\nON\n\nGU\nID\n\nE\n\nAN\nTI\n\n-C\nHA\n\nFE\n D\n\nIS\nC\n\nPL\nUG\n\nCU\nP\n\nEX\nPA\n\nNS\nIO\n\nN \nMA\n\nTE\nRI\n\nAL\n\nDI\nAP\n\nHR\nAG\n\nM\n\nHOT POSITION COLD POSITION\n\nFig. 10.8 Rostra Vernatherm paraffin actuators\n\n10.2.5  Motorized Cams or Doors\n\nTo deploy larger structural members while controlling deployment speed, motor-\nized cam releases or motorized structure deployments can be used. For example, the \naperture block of a space telescope, a large structure, can be deployed by a motor- \ndriven deployment mechanism which controls the speed of deployment. Usually, \nmotorized deployment mechanisms can be used repeatedly for they can close as \nwell as open the deployable structure.\n\n10.2.6  Separation System\n\nThe spacecraft-launch vehicle separation system needs to push up the heavy space-\ncraft within the stroke of the separation system springs to a velocity of about 3\u00a0ft./\nsec, and it must do so without tipping the spacecraft. Figure\u00a010.9a illustrates the \nPlanetary Systems Inc., Lightband motorized, pyroless separation system that \naccomplishes the above objectives. Figure\u00a0 10.9b shows the separation system \nreleased, showing the length of the pushoff springs and the part of the Lightband \nthat stays with the spacecraft. This system uses a large number of motorized cam \nsegments that hold the two halves of the band together.\n\n10 Deployment Mechanisms\n\n\n\n169\n\n10.2.7  Dampers\n\nTo restrain the speed of deployment and to avoid the shock when the deployed struc-\nture hits the stops, dampers are used. The most often used dampers are the fluid, \nmagnetic and inertial dampers.\n\n10.2.8  Fluid Dampers\n\nThe principle of the fluid damper is shown in Fig.\u00a010.10. When a piston is pushed \nin, as the attached structure is deployed, the fluid must go from one chamber to \nanother through orifices or holes. If the holes are small, damping is significant. If the \nholes are larger, there is less damping. There are dampers to damp linear motion like \nthe one shown in this figure and others, used to damp rotary motion.\n\nFig. 10.9 (a) Lightband motorized spacecraft-launch vehicle separation system (b) Motorized \npyroless lightband separation system motorized cam segments visible\n\n10.2  Restraint Devices\n\n\n\n170\n\n10.2.9  Magnetic Dampers\n\nMagnetic dampers, now used in suspension systems of automobiles, use an oil- \nbased magnetorheological fluid in a piston-cylinder mechanism. The fluid contains \nmagnetic particles. When a magnetic field is applied to the fluid, its viscosity is \nincreased to provide increased damping action. The speed with which viscosity can \nbe changed is on the order of a millisecond. Viscosity can be controlled by the size \nof the magnetic field.\n\n10.2.10  Constant Speed Governor Dampers\n\nGovernor mechanisms tend to rotate at constant speed. They can be attached to \ndeployable structures to damp their deployment speed. For example, the old- \nfashioned rotary telephone dial mechanism was used to control the deployment \nspeed of booms in several gravity gradient stabilized satellites using \u201cstacer\u201d booms. \nWithout these constant speed governors, the booms would have torn themselves \napart during deployment.\n\n10.3  Choosing the\u00a0Right Mechanism\n\nBecause of differences in the amount of force, the required electric power, and the \nsize and weight of the different release mechanisms, the process of selecting the \nright mechanism is not simple. In Fig.\u00a010.11, some qualitative guidelines are offered \nto aid the selection process.\n\nFig. 10.10 Fluid damper to damp linear motion (Taylor devices)\n\n10 Deployment Mechanisms\n\n\n\n171\n\nThe large electric power needed to operate some of the release mechanisms \n suggests that those mechanisms that need to be deployed simultaneously be stag-\ngered, if possible. In addition, since some of the devices require large currents (at \nlow voltage), several may be connected in series rather than in parallel.\n\n10.4  Testing Deployables\n\nBecause of their size and the need to simulate a zero G environment, testing large \ndeployables can be a challenge. Mechanical Ground Support Equipment (MGSE) \nhas to be designed to support the deployable structure and counterbalance gravity. \nEach structural member is suspended from cables that are counterbalanced with \nweights to simulate zero gravity.\n\nMore is said about testing deployables in the chapter on Integration and Test.\n\nMechanism Force Size Weight Power Cost\nExplosive Bolt Large Relatively Small Low\n\nModerate\nPulse Moderate\n\nExplosive Bolt-\nWire Cutters Large\n\nRelatively \nSmall Low Large Pulse Low\n\nSolenoid Pin \nPullers Moderate Medium Medium Large Low\n\nParaffin Pin \nPushers Medium\n\nRelatively \nSmall Medium Moderate Moderate\n\nMotorized Cams Large Medium-Large Large Low High\n\nFluid Dampers Large Medium Medium High High\nMagnetic \nDampers Medium Medium Medium High High\n\nGovernors Medium Medium Large None High\n\nFig. 10.11 Properties of retention-release mechanisms\n\n10.4  Testing Deployables\n\n\n\n173\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

The \nRocket Equation, given below, describes the fundamental property of a propulsion \nsystem. It gives the magnitude of change in spacecraft velocity as a function of the \nspacecraft and expanded fuel masses.\n\n \n?V g I ln 1 m / m* SP\n\n*\nP o= ? +( )  (11.1)\n\nwhere mo is the spacecraft initial mass, mP is the fuel mass, ISP is the Specific \nImpulse of the fuel used and g is the acceleration of gravity. The Specific Impulse is \na measure of fuel efficiency. It measures the fuel exhaust velocity (when multiplied \nby g) and its unit is in seconds. Values of ISP for various fuels are given in Fig.\u00a011.1.\n\n \nV sec I gE SP\n\n*( ) =  (11.2)\n\nFuel ISP(sec) Comments\n\nNitrogen gas under \npressure 70 Used in small spacecraft for station keeping\n\nButane 70 Used in small spacecraft instead of Nitrogen (higher density)\nHydrazine 160 Used in larger spacecraft for drag makeup, station keeping\nBipropellant 230 Used in Launch Vehicles and larger spacecraft\nLiquid LOX/LH2 268 Used in Launch Vehicles\nRocket Fuel\n(Castor) 280 Used in Launch Vehicles and as an apogee kick motor\n\nFig. 11.1 Specific impulse of different fuels\n\n\n\n174\n\nThe fuel mass required to achieve a given ?V is given by the equation below:\n\n \nm m 1 eP o\n\n( V*g*I )= ??? ??\n? ? SP\n\n \n(11.3)\n\nBy conservation of momentum, when a specific mass of fuel is expelled at a \ngiven velocity, producing an impulse of JFuel, then spacecraft velocity changes in the \nopposite direction by ?V\u00a0=\u00a0JFuel/mo.\n\nThe ?V can be used to change the orbit of the spacecraft or to move it back and \nforth for station keeping. Figure\u00a011.2 shows the geometry due to a \u201cburn\u201d tangential \nto an initial circular orbit. The ?V places the spacecraft in an elliptical orbit, \nwith the perigee of the orbit at the point of burn and the apogee 180 degrees later. \nThe period of the elliptical orbit is:\n\n \nP a*= ( )0.0001658 1.5  (11.4)\n\nPoint of Burn Becomes Perigee of New Orbit\nNew Orbit Has Larger Semi-Major Diameter;\nHence its period is Greater. This means that\nOne Orbit Later the Spacecraft Arrives at the\nPoint of Burn Later than a Spacecraft in the\nOriginal Orbit.\n\nInitial Orbit SMA1\n\nSMA2\n\nOrbit After Burn\n\nFig. 11.2 Geometry of a \u201cburn\u201d tangent to a circular orbit\n\nFor small ?V burns the Semi-Major Axis of the elliptical orbit, a, changes by \n?a, given by the equation:\n\n ? ?a 2 a V/ V\n* *=  (11.5)\n\nSince the Semi-Major Axis of the ellipse is greater than that of the initial circular \norbit, the period of the elliptical orbit will be greater, and it will take longer to return \nto the point of burn. By this time the spacecraft, had it remained in the initial circu-\nlar orbit, would have advanced forward by V*?P.\u00a0 This is a perplexing result, \nbecause thrusting to move the spacecraft forward, makes it actually fall behind.\n\n11 Propulsion\n\n\n\n175\n\nFigure 11.3 illustrates this situation with a numerical example. The result is that \nthe spacecraft received a thrust to move it forward at 1\u00a0m/s faster, and, instead, it \nseems to have moved backwards with an apparent velocity of 3\u00a0m/s.\n\nWhen a second burn is used at the Perigee to circularize the orbit with the origi-\nnal Semi-Major Axis by thrusting in the opposite direction, the spacecraft maintains \nits station 17.4\u00a0km behind its original position.\n\nThe basic steps in designing a propulsion system for a spacecraft are to:\n\n 1. Determine the ?V requirements\n 2. Choose the fuel type, and thus the ISP\n 3. Compute the fuel mass and volume required\n 4. Determine thrust vector accuracies/alignments required\n 5. Determine thrust granularity requirements\n 6. Configure the propulsion system (fuel tanks, valves, thrusters, heaters, \n\nelectronics)\n\nIn the following, an example will be carried through to illustrate these design \nsteps.\n\nExample\nIt is required that a 125\u00a0lb. (56.818 kg) spacecraft of 5 square foot (0.465 square \nmeter) cross sectional area be kept in a circular orbit at 560\u00a0km for 7\u00a0years. The \nspacecraft should not drop below 540\u00a0km.\n\nDetermine ?V requirements. At 560\u00a0km altitude, mean atmospheric density is \nabout 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010?13\u00a0kg/m3. To simplify calculations, variations of atmospheric density \nover the mission lifetimes are ignored. The drag force acting on the spacecraft, F, is \ngiven below, where ? is atmospheric density, D is the drag coefficient (typically \nequals to 2.2) and V is spacecraft velocity. The period at 560\u00a0km is 95.855997\u00a0min \nand the velocity is 7.580\u00a0km/s.\n\nProperty Quantity Dimension\nRadius of Earth (RE) 6,378.137 km\nSpacecraft Mass 50 Kg\nInitial Orbit Altitude 600 km\nInitial Orbit period 96.68900 minutes\nInitial Orbital Velocity 7.557724 km/sec\n?V 1 m/sec\n?a 1.846624 km\nPeriod of Ellipse 96.72739 minutes\n?P 2.302965 seconds\nDistance Spacecraft in Initial Orbit \nwould have traveled Forward\n\n17.40517 km\n\nApparent Reverse Speed of Spacecraft \nResulting from ?V Burn\n\n3.00 m/sec\n\nFig. 11.3 Spacecraft velocity resulting from ?V burn\n\n11.1 The Basics\n\n\n\n176\n\n Drag Force = F = 0.5 D A V 10 Newton\n* * * * 6? 2 ? \u00d7 ?4.007  (11.6)\n\nThis force decelerates the 56.818\u00a0kg spacecraft at 7.052\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010?8\u00a0m/s2. Over 7\u00a0years \nthe total loss of velocity is 15.57\u00a0m/s. This has to be made up by the propulsion \nsystem.\n\nDetermine Fuel Mass and Volume Requirements. Let us choose a simple cold gas \npropulsion system using nitrogen gas at an ISP\u00a0=\u00a070\u00a0s. The fuel mass for a given ?V \nfor this example is given below:\n\n \nm m 1 e = kgP o\n\n( V*g/ I )SP= ??? ??\n? ? 1.3273823\n\n \n(11.7)\n\nThe density of N2 at 15\u00a0psi is 0.00125\u00a0g/cu cm. At 6000\u00a0psi it is 0.5\u00a0g/cu cm, and \nat a readily available tank of 4500\u00a0psi it is 0.375\u00a0g/cu cm. At 6000\u00a0psi a tank of 2.655 \nliters is needed and at 4500\u00a0psi tank pressure a tank of 3.540 liters is needed.\n\nThe inlet pressure of a typical 1\u00a0N thruster is 215\u00a0psi. If the tank pressure is to \nremain above 215\u00a0psi, only 100*(6000-215)/6000\u00a0=\u00a096.4% of the fuel contained in \nthe tank can be used. Therefore, the 6000\u00a0psi tank volume should be 2.754 liters. \nSimilarly, the 4500\u00a0psi tank should be 3.718 liters.\n\nThe frequency of drag makeup burns depends on how low the spacecraft is per-\nmitted to drop. If the spacecraft minimum altitude is to be kept above 550\u00a0km, the \nmaximum decrease in velocity should not exceed 6.216\u00a0 m/s. This will occur in \n2.795\u00a0years. Therefore, over the 7-year mission life drag makeup burns of 6.216\u00a0m/s \nhave to be performed every 2.795\u00a0years (or smaller burns more frequently).\n\n11.2  Propulsion Systems\n\n11.2.1  Cold Gas Propulsion System\n\nFigure 11.4 shows the configuration of a small cold gas (N2) propulsion system. The \ntwo 2-liter fuel tanks are fueled through the check valve, and the tanks are pressur-\nized to 6000\u00a0psi. When ready to thrust, the Tank Shutoff Valve is opened to let the \nhigh pressure gas flow to the four thrusters through a pressure reducer. The 1\u00a0lb. \nthrusters are operating at a 215\u00a0psi inlet pressure. For this reason, 96.4% of the fuel \nin the tanks is available for thrusting before the tank pressure drops below 215\u00a0psi. \nThe thrusters are mounted at the four corners of a rectangular spacecraft. When fired \ntogether, they provide 4\u00a0lbs. of thrust. When only two thrusters are fired on the same \nside of the spacecraft, the spacecraft can be rotated. To make the thrust vector go \nthrough the principal axis of the spacecraft, the thrusters can be fired intermittently \n\n11 Propulsion\n\n\n\n177\n\nFig. 11.4 Cold gas propulsion system schematic\n\nFig. 11.5 Layout of a cold gas propulsion system\n\nwith variable duty cycles to compensate for the slight differences of thrust and \ndifferences in alignment among thrusters. Thruster valve opening and closing times \nare typically 3.5\u00a0ms (max) (Figs.\u00a011.5 and 11.6).\n\n11.2 Propulsion Systems\n\n\n\n178\n\nThe thrust vector should go through the spacecraft CG.\u00a0Since the position of the \nCG is not known with great accuracy, and since the thrusters cannot be aligned per-\nfectly, multiple thrusters intentionally straddling the expected CG position are \nemployed. In the propulsion system above, the four thrusters are aligned to pur-\nposely miss the expected CG position by about 2\u00a0cm. The misalignment of thrusters \nfrom the CG can be compensated for by varying the thrust durations. Whenever ?V \nburns are required, the spacecraft is turned (using the reaction wheels) so that its \nlongitudinal axis is aligned with the velocity vector. After the burn is completed, the \nspacecraft attitude is changed to the attitude required by the mission.\n\nThe moment of inertia of the spacecraft, assuming a uniform distribution of \nweight in its 24?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030? volume, is 3.326 slugs, and the angular acceleration \nimparted by a 1\u00a0lb. thruster acting through a line 2\u00a0cm from the CG is 0.01972\u00a0rad/s2 \n(1.13\u00a0deg./s2). If the other thruster, intentionally misaligned from the CG in the other \ndirection is only misaligned by 1\u00a0cm, the angular velocity after 1\u00a0s of burn will be \n0.556\u00a0deg./s. By increasing the burn duration of the other thruster to 2\u00a0s, the space-\ncraft angular velocity will be 0. Since thrusters typically open and close in about \n3\u00a0ms, the thrust granularity is more than enough to keep the spacecraft going straight.\n\n11.2.2  Hydrazine Propulsion System\n\nA Hydrazine propulsion system uses liquid hydrazine and expels it through heated \nthrusters. The hydrazine is put under (typically) 350\u2013500\u00a0psi pressure by a gas (typi-\ncally N2). The gas under pressure and the hydrazine are contained in the same tank; \n\nFig. 11.6 Photograph of a cold gas propulsion system that can provide 4 lbs of thrust\n\n11 Propulsion\n\n\n\n179\n\nbut the two are separated by a flexible bladder. In addition to fill and drain valves, a \npressure transducer monitors fuel pressure, and a filter with a 15\u201325 micron rating \nis used to ensure that no contaminant should get into the thruster valves. Hydrazine \ndensity is 0.9\u00a0g/cm3, while N2 at 6000\u00a0psi has a density of 0.5\u00a0g/cm3. Because of the \nISP and density advantage of hydrazine, for a given volume of fuel, a hydrazine sys-\ntem is capable of ?4 times greater ?V than a cold gas system (Fig.\u00a011.7)\n\nFill and Drain Velve for\nNitrogen Gas\n\nFill and Drain\nValve For\nHydrazine\n\nThrusters Contain Valves, Heaters\n\nPressure Transducer\n\nP\n\nN2\n\nN2H4\n\nF10 micron Filter\n\nDiaphragm\nTank\n\nFig. 11.7 A typical hydrazine propulsion system\n\n11.2.3  Other Propulsion Systems\n\nThe main type of spacecraft propulsion systems are the rocket motor, cold gas and \nthe hydrazine systems. However, other propulsion systems such as electric, nuclear, \nsolar pressure and others are beginning to be used. These will not be discussed here.\n\n11.3  Propulsion System Hardware\n\nSeveral manufacturers make components for spacecraft propulsion systems. Here, \nrepresentative samples are presented to provide a feel for the size, weight, perfor-\nmance and power consumption of typical components used in small LEO space-\ncraft. Kick motors, cold gas and hydrazine tanks and thrusters are described next.\n\nKick Motors circularize the orbits of an elliptical transfer orbit into which the \nlaunch vehicle injects a spacecraft. Typical kick motors are the STAR series of \nmotors.

To reduce their weight, these tanks \nare often made of thin titanium foil with graphite epoxy over-wrap. Typical tanks \nmade are listed in Fig.\u00a011.9.\n\nFor Hydrazine propulsion systems, the fuel tanks are divided into two parts. One \ncontains the hydrazine fuel, the other the pressurant gas. The two parts of the tank \nare separated by a bladder. Typical Diaphragm tanks for hydrazine propulsion sys-\ntems are shown in Fig.\u00a011.10.\n\nCold Gas Thrusters Several companies manufacture cold gas thrusters for space-\ncraft propulsion systems. Figure\u00a011.11 illustrates a typical small thruster and its \ntechnical characteristics.\n\nNote that the power consumption of this thruster is 30 watts. While the thrusters \nare usually turned on for only a short period of time, making the energy required to \n\n11 Propulsion\n\n\n\n181\n\noperate them relatively small, the fact that typically four thrusters may be fired \nsimultaneously, requires that the spacecraft should provide 120 watts at 28 volts to \noperate the propulsion system.\n\nThrusters for Hydrazine Propulsion Typical small thrusters for hydrazine propul-\nsion system are shown in Fig.\u00a011.12.\n\nFig. 11.11 A small (0.8\u00a0lbs) cold gas thruster (Courtesy of Moog Inc.,  \nSpace and Defense Group)\n\nProperty Moog 0.17 lb \nThruster\n051-271\n\nMoog 0.2 lb \nThruster\n051-346D\n\nMoog 9.0 lb \nThruster\n\n51-288\nOperating Pressure (psi) 386 400 500\nMax Response Time (msec) 1 10 15\nOperating Voltage (volts) 24-32 24-37 22-32\nPower Consumption (watts) 10.4 8.69 26.5\nWeight (gm) 30 218 230\nOperating Temperature (\u00b0C) 4.4-149 4.4-149 4.4-149\n\nFig. 11.12 Typical small hydrazine thruster characteristics (Courtesy of Moog Inc.,  \nSpace and Defense Group)\n\n11.4  Propulsion Maneuvers\n\n11.4.1  Maneuvers for\u00a0Spacecraft in\u00a0a\u00a0Constellation, \nMaintaining and\u00a0Getting to\u00a0Station\n\n11.4.1.1  Station Keeping\n\nLet us start with an example. Suppose we have a constellation of 24 Polar-Orbiting \nspacecraft, distributed in three planes, 120\u00b0 apart. Each plane has eight equally \nspaced spacecraft. Their true anomalies are 45\u00b0 apart. Each spacecraft is at a \n\n11.4 Propulsion Maneuvers\n\n\n\n182\n\nnominal 659.2\u00a0km altitude. The objective is to keep each spacecraft within \u00b110% of \nthe inter-satellite distance at all times. To reduce ground station work load, we spec-\nify that station-keeping maneuvers on each spacecraft should not be needed more \noften than once in 72\u00a0days. In this way, the ground station must perform station \nkeeping every 3\u00a0days on one of the 24 spacecraft. This situation is illustrated in \nFig.\u00a011.13. The red and the green arcs are the footprints of adjacent spacecraft, and \nthe footprints overlap.\n\nSlant range to the horizon is 2973.799\u00a0km. The Earth Subtended Angle by the \nspacecraft horizon-to-horizon footprint is:\n\n \n2 2 50 02\n\n2? ?= +( )?? ?? =? acos R R H/ . .\n?\n\n \n(11.8)\n\nFig. 11.13 Eight spacecraft per plane to maintain station by each moving back an forth\n\n11 Propulsion\n\n\n\n183\n\nThe ground footprint is 50/360*2*?*R\u00a0=\u00a05566\u00a0km. If each spacecraft position \nis to be maintained to \u00b110% of the nominal (44,216.892\u00a0km/8\u00a0=\u00a05527\u00a0km) inter- \nsatellite distance, then each is permitted to deviate from its nominal position by \n\u00b1552.7\u00a0km. Therefore, the average speed variance from the nominal orbital speed, \nmust be less than:\n\n \n2 552 7 72 24 60 60 0 177? ? ? ?( ) =. / . / sec.m  (11.9)\n\nWe already saw that to move a spacecraft in its orbit, a forward thrust of ?V \nresults in an elliptical orbit which puts the spacecraft behind its original burn position \nby a specific distance after each orbit. To determine the ?V required to achieve a \nspacecraft apparent speed of 0.177\u00a0m/s, we proceed as follows. Details of the calcu-\nlations are shown in Fig.\u00a011.14.\n\nNominal Orbit Period, Po = 97.9220209 min\nOrbital Velocity, Vo = 7.52586804 Km/sec\nRequired Apparent SC Speed, S = 0.177 m/sec\nDistance Moved Per Period, D = 1,039.932 meter\nDelta Period, ?P 0.138181 sec\nPeriod of Elliptical Orbit, PE 97.92432392 min\nThe Semi-Major Axis of the Ellipse, aE = 7,037.447 km\n? Semi-Major Axis =?a = 0.110 km\n?V burn required = ?a * V/(2a) 0.059 m/sec\n\nFig. 11.14 Calculating ?V required for station keeping\n\nThe orbit period at the nominal 659.2\u00a0 km altitude is 97.9220209\u00a0 min and the \norbital velocity (circumference of orbit/Period) is 7.525804\u00a0km/s. Since at the appar-\nent speed of 0.177\u00a0m/s the spacecraft should fall behind by 1039.9319 meters per \norbit, the ?P should be 1.38181\u00a0s, giving an elliptical orbit period of 97.9243239\u00a0min. \nThis corresponds to a Semi-Major Axis of 7037.447\u00a0km. The ? Semi-Major Axis, \n?a\u00a0=\u00a00.110\u00a0km; and the ?V required to achieve this is 0.059\u00a0m/s.\n\nThe reverse burn required after 72\u00a0days is 0.118\u00a0m/s. Half is required to re- circularize \nthe elliptical orbit at the altitude of the Perigee, and the other half is required to make \nthe spacecraft move in the opposite direction. So, the  station- keeping maneuver requires \n0.598\u00a0m/s ?V per year or 4.187\u00a0m/s over a 7-year mission. This is a very modest \namount of fuel.\n\n11.4.1.2  Getting on\u00a0Station\n\nSuppose we require that the spacecraft that must travel the furthest to get on station \nmust travel 22,264\u00a0km (4 inter-satellite distances); and suppose we require that this \nspacecraft get on station in 10\u00a0days. The average required spacecraft speed should \nbe 25.7685\u00a0m/s. The spacecraft must be put into an elliptical orbit so that it would \n\n11.4 Propulsion Maneuvers\n\n\n\n184\n\nfall back 151.398\u00a0m/orbit. The ?P should be 20.117044\u00a0 s and the period of the \nellipse should be 98.25730497\u00a0 min. This results in the Semi-Major Axis of the \nellipse to be 7053.392\u00a0km. The ?a is 16.055\u00a0km, and the ?V required to produce \nthis is 8.565\u00a0m/s.\n\nIt is seen that getting this spacecraft on station quickly takes twice as much fuel \nas station keeping for 7\u00a0years. Considerable fuel could be saved by relaxing the time \ninterval allowed to get this spacecraft on station. The innocuous requirement to \nestablish the constellation in 10\u00a0days drives the propulsion system requirements.\n\nFigure 11.15 illustrates the details of the station-keeping maneuver. The left- \nhand figure shows the spacecraft nadir pointing and performing its mission. It trav-\nels from left to right. Note that the center of pressure is at the center of the spacecraft; \nbut the CG is below it. For this reason, at low orbit altitudes there is an atmospheric \ntorque that tends to rotate the spacecraft counterclockwise. Below about 550\u00a0km \naltitude this can be significant, and to counter it may take fuel or the use of the reac-\ntion wheels. When it comes time to initiate a burn to the right, the spacecraft is \nturned 90\u00b0 so that the thrusters are tangential to the orbit. Note that both thrusters \nhave thrust vectors that purposely straddle the CG.\u00a0If any of the thrusters are slightly \nmisaligned, varying the duty cycles of the different thrusters, the net thrust vector \ncan be kept parallel to the spacecraft velocity vector.\n\nThe spacecraft in the second position is ready to thrust to move the spacecraft to \nthe right and into an elliptical orbit. Note that in this attitude the CG and the CP are \nboth on the line of the velocity vector, eliminating atmospheric drag torque. Also, \nthe spacecraft cross-section is smaller, reducing atmospheric drag and prolonging \nmission life. In fact, if the mission permits it, the spacecraft could be flown horizon-\ntally most of the time, and it could be put in a nadir-pointing position only when the \nmission must be performed.\n\nIn the third position, the spacecraft has been turned around 180\u00b0 and is ready to \nburn to stop (and reverse) spacecraft station-keeping motion. At the end of the \nreverse burn, the spacecraft is again nadir pointed to permit it to resume its \nmission.\n\nPerforms\nMission\n\nThrust Right to \nProvide ?V\n\nThrust Left to \nProvide ?V\n\nPerforms\nMissionCenter of\n\nPressure\n\nCenter of\nGravity\n\nFig. 11.15 Details of station-keeping burns\n\n11 Propulsion\n\n\n\n185\n\n11.4.1.3  Thrust Duration\n\nLet us again assume that the spacecraft weighs 125\u00a0 lbs. Using all four thrusters \nproducing 4\u00a0 lbs. of thrust, the required station keeping ?V of 0.059\u00a0m/s can be \nachieved in 17.5\u00a0ms. The duration of the burn to put the furthest spacecraft on sta-\ntion is 2.533\u00a0s. Typical cold gas thrusters can be opened and closed in 3\u00a0ms. Thus, \nthere might be a problem of executing a 17.5\u00a0ms burn precisely. The thrust schedule \nhas to be planned and the thrust strategy has to be tested to implement the required \nthrust.\n\nIf the size of each thruster were reduced to (say) 0.2\u00a0lbs., then burn times for sta-\ntion keeping and for getting on station would increase to 85\u00a0 ms and 12.665\u00a0 s, \nrespectively.\n\n11.4.1.4  Hohmann Transfer Orbit Maneuver\n\nA frequent application of a spacecraft propulsion system is to change the altitude \nof the orbit. The minimum energy transfer is a Hohmann transfer, where a ?VP \nburn puts the spacecraft in an elliptical orbit where the point of burn becomes the \nPerigee of the elliptical orbit. A second ?VA burn is applied at the Apogee of the \nelliptical orbit to circularize the orbit with the Apogee altitude. In the example \nbelow, it is required to raise the altitude of a 600\u00a0km circular orbit to a 700\u00a0km \ncircular orbit. Figure\u00a011.16 illustrates the geometry and the calculations to obtain \nthe ?VP and ?VA.\n\nFrom initial and final altitudes the elliptical transfer orbit semi-major axis, a, is \ncomputed. This is (7028.137\u00a0km). The change in semi-major axis from the initial \ncircular orbit is ?a (50\u00a0km). The first burn takes place at a point that becomes the \nPerigee of the elliptical transfer orbit; and the size of this burn is ?VP\u00a0=\u00a026.884\u00a0m/s. \nThe second burn, ?VA, takes place at the Apogee and is approximately the same \nsize. Thus the total ?V required to raise the orbit from 600\u00a0 km to 700\u00a0 km is \n53.768\u00a0m/s. It takes 48.865\u00a0min to perform the orbit transfer.\n\n11.5  Other Propulsion Requirements\n\nThere are other, less often used, propulsion requirements. These include the Spin Up \nand Spin Down of spin-stabilized spacecraft. Generally, a cold gas system has ade-\nquate ?V to implement spin ups.\n\nThere is an increasing need to deorbit spacecraft at end-of-life to reduce space \ndebris. The energy required to do this maneuver usually requires the use of a rocket \nmotor, and the ?V required is substantial.\n\n11.5 Other Propulsion Requirements\n\n\n\n186\n\nCollision Avoidance is an emerging requirement. No clear avoidance strategy has \nyet been devised. However, a strategy of raising or lowering the orbit a little bit is a \npossible, low energy strategy, if the protected spacecraft can be alerted in time to \nperform such a maneuver.\n\nFig. 11.16 Calculation of ?V required for Hohmann transfer orbit\n\n11 Propulsion\n\n\n\n187\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

In the direction of the \nSun, the heat incident on a spacecraft can be huge, while on the side opposite the \nSun, the spacecraft faces cold space. The objective of the thermal design is to bring \nthese temperatures into a range where the spacecraft components can safely operate, \nand to ensure that internally generated heat from the spacecraft components is con-\nducted or radiated out to maintain all spacecraft temperatures within the operating \ntemperature ranges of its components. Typical component temperature operating \nranges are given in Fig.\u00a012.1. The goal is to design for component temperatures in \nthe 10\u00b0\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C range.\n\nComponent Typical Operating \nTemperature Range \u00b0C\n\nElectronics -20 to +40\nSpecial Electronics (like Reaction Wheels) 0 to 35\nSolar Panels -100 to +100\nHydrazine 10 to 70\n\nFig. 12.1 Typical temperature ranges of spacecraft components\n\nIn steady state, the heat absorbed from the Sun, Albedo and Earth IR, plus the \nheat generated in the spacecraft equals the heat radiated out for some spacecraft \ntemperature. The thermal design process is to vary surface finishes and radiators to \nachieve this balance at the desired spacecraft temperature. The design process \nconsists of the following steps:\n\n 1. Flow down the thermal requirements from component thermal specifications \n(to determine the acceptable spacecraft and component temperature ranges)\n\n 2. Assess the solar flux, Albedo and Earth IR radiation incident on the spacecraft \nin its orbit, and compute the orbit average heat on each of the spacecraft outside \n\n\n\n188\n\nsurfaces. The environment depends on the Beta angle. Assess the range of Beta \nover the mission life of the spacecraft.\n\n 3. Compute the heat absorbed by the spacecraft surfaces\n 4. Determine the heat generated by the spacecraft electronics\n 5. The sum of the heat from steps 3 and 4 is the heat that has to be rejected for \n\nsteady state. Iterate radiator and surface finishes to reject that much heat.\n 6. Construct a thermal model, including locations of its heat generating \n\ncomponents\n 7. Compute spacecraft temperatures as a function of time\n 8. Apply techniques to bring these temperatures within component specifications. \n\nThese techniques include:\n\n (a) Applying paint or other surface finishes to reduce heat absorption or \nincrease heat radiation\n\n (b) Apply heaters to increase temperatures of cold components (such as \nbatteries)\n\n (c) Use metallic or other heat conductors to take heat from hot components to \npoints from where heat can be radiated out to space\n\n 9. When the spacecraft is completed, conduct thermal vacuum tests to determine \nthe actual spacecraft and component temperatures as a function of time and in \nthe steady state\n\n 10. Correlate the thermal model to bring it in conformity with actual measurements \nobtained during test\n\n 11.

Depending on the absorptivity, ?, of the material on which it is inci-\ndent, and on the emissivity, ?, of the surface that can radiate the heat into space, the \ntemperature of the surface is given by Eq.\u00a012.1.\n\n \n? ?\u00b0( ) = ( ) ( )( )S / A / A /* * i r .? ? ? 0 25  where\n\n \n(12.1)\n\nS\u00a0=\u00a0the Sun radiance\u00a0=\u00a0nominally 1367 Watt/m2\n\nAi\u00a0=\u00a0Area of surface of Sun incidence normal to Sun\nAr\u00a0=\u00a0Area of surfaces radiating to space\n? and ? absorptivity and emissivity of the surfaces\n?\u00a0=\u00a05.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010?8\u00a0W/m2/K4\n\n12 Thermal Design\n\n\n\n189\n\nTo appreciate how large the Sun incident radiation is, consider an example of a \n1\u00a0m2 plate of absorptivity and emissivity both equal to 1.0. Applying Eq.\u00a012.1, the \ntemperature of the surface becomes T\u00a0=\u00a0393\u00b0 K or +120\u00a0\u00b0 C.\u00a0That is pretty hot.\n\nThe thermal environments in typical LEO orbits are discussed below.\nFrom a thermal design point of view, the space environment seen by a spacecraft \n\ncan be defined by the sum of the orbit average solar flux, the Albedo and Earth IR \nincident on each side of the spacecraft in its orbit. Of these, solar flux is the major \ncontributor. The amount of sunlight illuminating each side of a spacecraft can be \ncomputed for any orbit altitude and Beta with the aid of equations (and spreadsheet) \ndeveloped in Sect. 3.6. For example, the Orbit Average solar fluxes incident on each \nof the sides of a 20?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036? nadir-pointing spacecraft for Beta angles ranging \nfrom 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 inclination are given in Fig.\u00a012.2.\n\nIncl\ndeg\n\nAltitude\nkm\n\nBeta\ndeg\n\n+X \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n-X \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n+Y \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n-Y \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n+Z \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n-Z \nOA \n\nwatts\n\nTotal \nOA \n\nwatts\n70 600 0 141.3 141.3 0 0 111.7 9.6 403.9\n70 600 30 128.3 128.3 0 208.1 97.2 11.8 573.6\n70 600 45 112.5 112.4 0 331.8 79.6 15.0 631.3\n70 600 60 91.4 91.4 0 440.7 56.3 23.7 703.5\n70 600 75 52.3 52.3 0 613.4 29.0 29.0 776.0\n70 600 90 0 0 0 635.0 0 0 635.0\n\nFig. 12.2 Orbit average incident solar flux (watts) on each side of a  \nnadir-pointing spacecraft (20?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036?)\n\nValues in this figure are the projection of the Sun on a unit area of each side as a \nfunction of time (from which the orbit average area could be computed). Then, these \nprojections are multiplied by the areas of the sides and by the solar flux of 0.882 \nWatt/square inch.\n\nThis figure shows that at Beta\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0 is the highest total incidence of 776 Watts, \nwhile at Beta\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0 is the largest thermal gradient. The ?Y side will get very hot, \nwhile the +Y side will face cold space. The above table takes into account the \neclipse, of up to 35.36\u00a0min duration, when none of the sides gets any Sun.\n\nThe instantaneous solar flux incident on each side of the spacecraft is shown (for \nBeta\u00a0=\u00a045\u00b0) in Fig.\u00a012.3. In this figure, each curve represents the fraction of the area \nof a side normal to the Sun at any instant of time. The blue curve is the total flux \nincident on the spacecraft at any point in time.\n\n12.1 The Thermal Environment\n\n\n\n190\n\nThe incident solar flux depends on Beta, which varies over a range of \u00b190\u00b0. \nDuring positive Betas, the Sun illuminates the +Y side. During negative Betas the \nSun illuminates the ?Y side. Beta must be computed for the mission life of the \nspacecraft. Figure\u00a012.4 shows Beta as a function of time for an entire year. It is seen \n\nFig. 12.3 Solar flux incident on each side of a spacecraft as the  \nfraction of each panel normal to the sun vs. time. Panel areas are scaled  \n\nby their relative size\n\nFig. 12.4 Beta for one year per month of the year\n\n12 Thermal Design\n\n\n\n191\n\nthat for this mission Beta varies mostly from 0\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 with most of the time spent \nbetween 10\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.\n\nTo obtain the total heat incident on the sides of the spacecraft, the contributions \nof Albedo and Earth IR radiation must be computed and added. Earth IR radiation \nand Albedo vary with latitude, time of year and orbit inclination. At 600\u00a0km, Earth \nIR incident is 0.119 Watts/in2 on the nadir surface and 0.035 Watts/in2 on surfaces \nnormal to nadir. Figure\u00a012.5 shows these orbit average Albedo powers for the same \ncases as given for Sun incidence in Fig.\u00a012.2.\n\nNote that Albedo fluxes are much smaller than solar fluxes, but they are not neg-\nligible. These three fluxes are average fluxes and do not consider natural variations \ndue to cloud cover, nor the 7% seasonal variation because the Earth orbit around the \nSun is elliptical.\n\nEarth IR flux incident on this spacecraft is 149 Watts.\n\nIncl\ndeg\n\nAltitude\nkm\n\nBeta +X \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n-X \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n+Y \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n-Y \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n+Z \nOA \n\nwatts\n\n-Z\nOA\n\nwatts\n\nTotal \nOA \n\nwatts\n70 600 0 18.5 18.5 18.5 18.5 0 34.5 108.4\n70 600 30 16.1 16.1 14.5 17.9 0 30.1 94.6\n70 600 45 13.3 13.3 10.9 15.2 0 24.5 77.2\n70 600 60 9.3 9.3 6.7 12.4 0 17.5 55.2\n70 600 75 5.0 5.0 2.5 9.1 0 9.7 31.4\n70 600 90 2.4 2.4 0.7 6.9 0 3.2 15.5\n\nFig. 12.5 Albedo orbit average incident flux (watts)  \non each side of a 20?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036? nadir- pointing spacecraft\n\n12.2  Heat Absorption\n\nFigure 12.2 showed the solar flux incident on each side of the 20?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036? exam-\nple spacecraft. The heat absorbed depends on the surface finishes of the sides. For \nexample, if 75% of each side of the spacecraft is covered with solar cells (absorptiv-\nity\u00a0=\u00a00.82) and the rest of the sides are painted white (absorptivity\u00a0=\u00a00.19), then the \nnet orbit average heat absorbed is only 0.75*0.82\u00a0+\u00a00.19*0.25\u00a0=\u00a00.6625 times the \nincident orbit average solar flux. So, the flux incident on each side of the spacecraft \nin the inclinations and Beta angles listed in Fig.\u00a012.2 must be multiplied by 0.6625 \nto calculate the heat absorbed by each side. The electric power generated by the \nsolar cells must be subtracted from the calculation of the absorbed heat.\n\nTo determine the Earth IR absorbed, multiply together the flux, panel area and \nsurface emittance.\n\nIf there are deployable solar panels that block incident fluxes or obscure the view \nfrom space, the absorbed heat calculation is more complicated. A thermal model of \nthe spacecraft is needed.\n\n12.2 Heat Absorption\n\n\n\n192\n\n12.3  Heat Rejection\n\nFor thermal balance, heat absorbed plus heat generated internally must equal \nheat rejected. The ability to reject heat from a surface of area, A square inches, \nof emissivity\u00a0=\u00a0? from a temperature T(\u00b0K) is given by Eq.\u00a012.2. This is the emit-\nted heat in a direction normal to the surface. Heat radiated hemispherically \n(which should be used in calculations of heat rejected by the spacecraft) is typi-\ncally 5% less.\n\nQ watts A T 3 104( ) = = ??? ?? ??* * * . /where Watts in266 11\u00d7\u00d7  (12.2)\n\nIf the intent of the thermal design is to keep spacecraft temperatures in the range \nof +5\u00a0\u00b0C to +25\u00a0\u00b0C, then each of the spacecraft X and Y sides can reject about 140 \nwatts of heat. Since the sum of the Sun, Albedo and Earth IR absorbed heat ranges \nfrom 538 watts to 779 watts (from Figs.\u00a012.2 and 12.3) and hemispherical emissiv-\nity\u00a0=\u00a00.8, the temperature (from Eq.\u00a012.2) will be 16\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0The same exterior surfaces \nwill be ?7\u00a0\u00b0C to reject 538 watts. The temperature difference between the Hot and \nthe Cold cases is 23\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nWhere solar cells do not populate the spacecraft exterior, various surface finishes \ncan be used to modify the spacecraft temperature range. Low absorptive finishes can \nbe employed to reduce the absorbed solar and Albedo heat. MLI can be used to \nnearly eliminate absorbed solar heat; however, MLI reduces the rejection area. By \nappropriately choosing surface finishes, a thermal balance can be achieved in a tem-\nperature range acceptable to the spacecraft components.\n\nThe foregoing illustrated the principals involved. An accurate thermal treatment \nof a spacecraft can be accomplished only through use of a good thermal model.\n\n12.4  Heat Generated by the\u00a0Spacecraft Electronics\n\nThe electric power consumption for each spacecraft operating mode and for each \ncomponent was shown for a specific spacecraft in Chap. 4, Electric Power Subsystem \nDesign. It is repeated here as Fig.\u00a012.6.\n\nFrom this figure it is seen that the Orbit Average Power is about 20 watts, and \nthat the instantaneous power varies from about 17.9 watts to 20.6 watts. The \npeak power (excluding the 10 watt fraction of the transmitter power radiated as \nRF power) is 26 watts. The reaction wheels consume up to about 27 watts while \nthe wheels are accelerating. Since they do so for only very short periods of time, \nthe excess reaction wheel power consumption over the average power can be \nignored.\n\nSolar cells convert solar power to electrical power. This reduces the power \nabsorbed.\n\n12 Thermal Design\n\n\n\n193\n\n12.5  Tools Available for\u00a0Altering Spacecraft Thermal \nPerformance\n\nAbsorption and radiation of heat can be altered by:\n\n (a) Surface Finishes (white paint will reduce, black paint will increase the temperature)\n (b) Metalic conduction from hot parts of the spacecraft to cold parts so it could \n\nradiate heat into space\n (c) Heat pipes that can increase thermal conduction from one point to another\n (d) Heaters (to increase the temperature of components that are too cold\u00a0 - like \n\nbatteries)\n (e) Louvers that can open or close surfaces and can change their absorptivity or \n\nemissivity\n (f) MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) to protect a wrapped volume by reducing \n\nabsorbed radiation\n (g) Thermoelectric Coolers (to spot cool electronics parts)\n (h) Placing heat generating components where it is easy to get rid of heat\n\n12.5.1  The Impact of\u00a0Surface Finishes\n\nTo illustrate how surface finishes can reduce the temperature of surfaces exposed to \ndirect sunlight, the table of absorptivity and emissivity of different finishes is shown \nin Fig.\u00a012.7.\n\nFig. 12.6 Power consumption in different operating modes\n\n12.5 Tools Available for\u00a0Altering Spacecraft Thermal Performance\n\n\n\n194\n\nAs an example of the effectiveness of paint in controlling the temperature of \nspacecraft outer surfaces, consider the previous example of a 1\u00a0m2 plate; but in this \nexample the plate is painted with Corning White Paint DC-007. The equation for \ntemperature of the plate is now given in Eq.\u00a012.3 where S is solar flux in Watts/m2 \nand ?\u00a0=\u00a05.67*10?8Watts/m2.\n\n \n\nT K = S* / * A / A /\n\n= . / . 1 / .\n\ni r\n\n.\n\n* * *\n\n?( ) ( ) ( )( )\n( ) ?\n\n? ? ?\n0 25\n\n81367 0 19 0 84 5 67 10(( )( ) = ?\u00b0 \u00b00 25 271 7 1 3. . .?or C\n (12.3)\n\nThis is a significant change. By reducing the fraction of the area of the plate \npainted white, the temperature of the plate can be brought into the region where \nelectronics can safely operate.\n\n12.5.2  Thermal Conduction\n\nIn the thermal design, it is important to not only design for heat balance at a desired \ntemperature, but also to move heat from a hot part of the spacecraft to a cool part, or \nto an area from where heat can be radiated out to space. The heat transport process \nhas radiated and conductive paths. Considering conduction only, the fundamental \nequation for determining the amount of heat a metallic conductor can move from \none place to another is given in Eq.\u00a012.4.\n\n   \nq = k A/ L dT,*\n\n*( ) where  (12.4)\n\nk\u00a0=\u00a0conductivity in KW change per \u00b0K (or \u00b0C) over length m\nA\u00a0=\u00a0the cross section of the conducting structure in m2\n\ndT\u00a0=\u00a0difference in temperatures between the two ends of the conductor\nL\u00a0=\u00a0the length of the conductive path in m, and\nq\u00a0=\u00a0is the heat conducted in watts\n\nFig. 12.7 Absorptivity and emissivity of different surfaces and the thermal conductivities and \nspecific gravities of selected metals\n\n12 Thermal Design\n\n\n\n195\n\nThe penalty on spacecraft weight that heat conduction imposes can be substan-\ntial. To illustrate this, consider the 20?\u00a0 \u00d7\u00a0 20?\u00a0 \u00d7\u00a0 36? spacecraft example already \n discussed. If the goal is to move 20% of the absorbed solar heat from a sunny side \nto the opposite shaded side, consider using the three existing aluminum equipment \ndecks of 20?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020? each. Aluminum conductance is 3.6\u00a0W/in C\u00b0. To compute how \nthick these plates have to be and to ensure (for purposes of this example) that ther-\nmal gradients in these decks should be <10\u00a0\u00b0C, Eq.\u00a012.5 must be satisfied.

The spacecraft \nweight budget prohibits such a solution.\n\nThere are a number of ways to overcome this problem, including:\n\n\u2022 Not covering the entire Sun-facing panel with solar cells\n\u2022 Employing other exterior finishes (as discussed in Sect. 12.5.1)\n\u2022 Using deployable arrays so that the exterior of the spacecraft could be covered \n\nwith a low absorptance finish\n\u2022 Isolating the body mounted array panels from the structure\n\u2022 Adding heat pipes into the three interior decks (see Sect. 12.5.4)\n\n12.5.3  Conducting Heat across\u00a0Screwed Plates or Bolt \nBoundaries\n\nThermal conductivity through a metal structure is reduced at each joint between \nmembers of the structure. A bolted joint, for instance, creates thermal resistance. \nThermal conductivity through bolted plates depends on the pressure with which the \nplates are bolted together. The conductance of bolted joints as a function of the bolt \ntorquedown for various bold diameters is given in the Aerospace Thermal Control \nHandbook Volume 1.\n\n12.5.4  Heat Pipes\n\nHeat pipes are hermetically sealed extrusions, or pipes partially filled with a liquid \nused for spreading heat over relatively long distances with small gradients. In space-\ncraft applications, the aluminum pipes have internal grooves and use ammonia as \nthe working fluid. Capillary forces wick the liquid along grooves from the cold end \nto the heat source. At the heat source, the liquid evaporates and the vapor flows \ndown the pipe center and condenses on the colder areas of the pipe. Contrary to \n\n12.5 Tools Available for\u00a0Altering Spacecraft Thermal Performance\n\n\n\n196\n\nnormal conductors (e.g. through metal plates), gradients do not increase for the \ndistance the heat travels down the pipe. Due to the small capillary wicking forces, \nthese pipes need to be horizontal (within 0.05?) to be tested in 1G.\n\nHeat pipes have a transport limit. A typical \u00bd? OD heat pipe has a 5000 Watt/\ninch transport limit. One pipe can carry 250\u00a0W 20 inches. There are two gradients\u00a0- \none at the evaporator (where the heat enters the pipe), the other at the condenser \n(where the heat leaves the pipe). A \u00bd? OD evaporator conductance is typically 4\u00a0W/\nin-C\u00b0 (where the heat travels into the pipe). Pipe condenser conductance is 8\u00a0W/\nin-C\u00b0. These conductances do not include gradients at the heat pipe flanges or inter-\nface gradients.\n\nIn the example in Sect. 12.5.2, 72\u00a0W had to be carried across 3 decks with less \nthan 10\u00a0 \u00b0C gradient. A single pipe (almost 80? long) could be attached near the \noutboard edge of each deck. Each pipe would need to carry 24 watts 40 inches, \napproximately 1000 watt-inches, well within the transport capability. Allowing for \npipe radii, the contact area along the edge would be 16 inches. The pipe gradients \nwould be:\n\n \n\ndT Q h L W W in C in C\n\ndT Q h\n\nevap evap evap\n\ncond c\n\n= ( ) = ?( ) =\n=\n\n? ? \u00b0/ / / .\n\n/\n\n24 4 16 0 4\n\noond condL W W in C in C\n? ? \u00b0( ) = ?( ) =24 8 16 0 2/ / .\n\n \n\n(12.6)\n\nThis is a very low gradient. The weight of 80? of heat pipe (with 1?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.040? \nflanges) is 1.2 lbs. As seen, heat pipes are an effective means to mitigate gradients \nin the equipment decks.\n\n12.5.5  Louvers\n\nLouvers are like adjustable blinds that permit partially opening a surface of the \nspacecraft to the outside (either on the space side to control emissivity or on the \nsunny side to control absorptivity). Louvers were popular in years past, but now \nthey have lost favor to alternate thermal control hardware options.\n\n12.5.6  Heaters\n\nHeaters are used to spot heat specific components, such as batteries, that are not \nallowed to drop below their respective minimum temperatures. Since heaters con-\nsume electric power, a rare commodity in a spacecraft, they should only be used \nwhere absolutely necessary. Heaters operate in a bang-bang manner; they are either \nON or they are OFF.\u00a0 The duty cycle determines the average temperature of the \nheaters.\n\n12 Thermal Design\n\n\n\n197\n\n12.6  Constructing a\u00a0Thermal Model of\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft\n\nIn the preceding examples, the spacecraft was idealized to simplify analyses. For \nmore accurate analyses a thermal model is needed. The thermal model keeps track \nof complex heat flows, and it can predict temperatures, both steady state and \ntransient.\n\nThe model uses a series of nodes that represent components, external surfaces, \ninternal structure, items that dissipate heat, and items whose temperature is of spe-\ncial interest.\n\nThe nodes are interconnected with conductive (linear) and radiative (fourth \npower) couplings, similar to an electrical circuit comprised of resistors. The model \niterates to predict heat flow between interconnected nodes, and outputs the tempera-\ntures of each node. Thermal Desktop is the best known software for constructing \nspacecraft thermal models. This graphically based program includes:\n\n\u2022 Geometry generation (or importing common geometric models)\n\u2022 Conductive coupling calculations\n\u2022 Internal radiation couplings (radKs)\n\u2022 External radiation couplings (radKs) to space\n\u2022 External absorbed environmental flux calculations\n\u2022 Temperature and heat flow calculations (using SINDA)\n\u2022 It then presents the SINDA Model results in graphical, geometric or tabular \n\nformat\n\nWhen constructing a model, resist the urge to make it more detailed or more \ngranular than it really has to be, lest the model become the problem rather than part \nof the solution. In Thermal Desktop, subdividing a surface takes but a few mouse \nclicks. Simplifying a subdivided surface requires deleting the article, rebuilding it, \nreconnecting and verifying it. Start simple to get a feel for thermal drivers. Scrutinize \nthe results and crosscheck them against hand or EXCEL calculations. Every model \nhas limitations and flaws. Efficient modeling requires understanding the model lim-\nitations to adjust the flaws that introduce large errors.\n\nThe thermal model is used to provide temperature predictions for various mis-\nsion phases, Beta angles and operating modes. These results are incorporated into a \nsummary of predictions that can be compared to the component temperature require-\nments. The thermal model is also used to predict spacecraft temperatures during \nthermal testing.\n\n12.7  A Point Design Example\n\nThis section provides an example of how requirements must be modified, and hard-\nware manipulated into a cohesive design. For purposes of this design, it is assumed \nthat heater power is unavailable.\n\n12.7 A Point Design Example\n\n\n\n198\n\nFigure 12.1 indicated that the operating temperatures for electronics is allowed \nto vary from ?20\u00a0\u00b0C to 40\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0Some of the Electronics may have to operate over a \nnarrower range. So, the design should be for a\u00a0?\u00a015\u00a0\u00b0C to 40\u00a0\u00b0C allowable tempera-\nture variation.\n\nThe cause of temperature uncertainties and their likely magnitudes are discussed \nnext, leaving the discussion of the range of orbit Betas for last.\n\n (a) Since models are imperfect, in a thermal design, typically a 5\u00a0\u00b0C margin is used \nin both the hot and cold cases. So, the design must strive to keep the temperature \nbetween ?10\u00a0\u00b0C and +35\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n (b) An additional 5\u00a0\u00b0C should be budgeted to account for variations in surface finish \nabsorptance and emittance, and for finish degradation toward End-of-Life.\n\n (c) Earlier in this chapter, incident fluxes were computed. However, these fluxes \nvary over time. Specifically, solar incident flux varies 7% annually. Earth IR and \nAlbedo also vary considerably even at a given Beta angle. Collectively, these \nvariations can cause up to 10\u00a0\u00b0C temperature variation for a given Beta.\n\n (d) Eclipses are expected to cause at least 5\u00b0 to 10\u00a0\u00b0C variation over a single orbit. \nThis transient effect is not addressed by the orbit average fluxes calculated for \nthe various Betas.\n\n (e) Budget an additional 5\u00a0\u00b0C to account for transients due to component power \nconsumption variations, such as turning the transmitter ON.\n\nGrouping all of these factors together, the temperature uncertainty takes up about \n35\u00a0\u00b0C of the available operating temperature range goal.\n\nGradients between the warmest and coldest components are on the order of \n10\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0However, satellite gradients can be reduced by adding heat pipes.\n\nSubjecting the 20?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020?\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036? spacecraft (covered with solar cells) over a large \nrange of Betas caused a 23\u00a0\u00b0C spacecraft average temperature change. Combining \nthe 23\u00a0\u00b0C variation due to variations in Beta, and other factors already discussed, \nwould exceed the allowable temperature range.\n\nReducing the effects of solar variations over the range of Betas is key to success-\nful thermal design. The goal is to modify the finishes so that the Beta\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0 hot case \nand Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 cold case result in nearly the same spacecraft temperature.\n\nAssume that the finish of 30% of the external surface can be modified, as shown \nin Fig.\u00a012.8.\n\nThe spacecraft flies with +Z facing anti-nadir. Velocity is in the +X direction. \nVisualize several Betas, starting with Beta\u00a0 =\u00a0 0\u00b0. The Sun is in the plane of the \nBeta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 orbit, and the eclipse is the longest for any orbit altitude. During each \nBeta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 orbit, the Sun illuminates the +X, then the +Z, followed by the ?X, and \nlastly, the ?Z side of the spacecraft. Since Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 is the cold case, the choice of the \nfinish should allow collecting as much energy as possible. To keep the spacecraft \nfrom becoming too cold, the +X, +Z, ?X and ?Z sides should remain black, or cov-\nered with highly absorptive solar cells. The two Y sides receive no incident sun.\n\n12 Thermal Design\n\n\n\n199\n\nDuring the Beta\u00a0=\u00a0+75\u00b0 hot case, when there is no eclipse, the Sun illuminates \nthe +Y spacecraft face. During the Beta\u00a0=\u00a0?75\u00b0 hot case, the Sun illuminates the \u2013Y \nface. The spacecraft receives solar illumination constantly. For this reason either a \nlow solar absorptance finish or MLI should be applied to the +Y and \u2013Y sides to \nreduce the environmental heat absorbed during the hot case.\n\nMLI is preferred since:\n\n (a) MLI is more effective blocking the incident Sun in the hot case\n (b) MLI reduces the heat escaping from the spacecraft during the Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 cold \n\ncase\n\nA spreadsheet calculation indicates that, with the remaining 70% of the surfaces \nhaving absorptivites of 0.82, the temperature variation of 23\u00a0\u00b0C (between Beta 0\u00b0 \nand 75\u00b0) is reduced to about half.\n\n12.8  Thermal and\u00a0Thermal Vacuum Testing\n\nA thermal vacuum test series includes several test phases: Thermal Balance, Thermal \nCycling and testing for Outgasing. Thermal Cycling and Outgasing are addressed in \nSect. 14.5. Thermal Cycling is a spacecraft workmanship test. Outgasing prevents \nvolatile contaminants from condensing on sensitive surfaces. The Thermal Balance \ntest simulates the hot and cold flight environments to obtain spacecraft flight tem-\nperatures. Temperatures are recorded for later analyses to determine differences \nbetween model predictions and test results.\n\n30% of Each Side\n\n+X +Y\n\n+Z\n\n+X\n\n+X\n\nX+\nX+\n\nEarth\nShadow\n\nFig. 12.8 Nadir-pointing spacecraft flying in +X direction  \n30% of its surfaces available for application of surface finishes\n\n12.8 Thermal and\u00a0Thermal Vacuum Testing\n\n\n\n200\n\nThermal Balance is usually tested at two or three balance points (conditions). \nThe balance points vary the spacecraft\u2019s radiative boundary conditions to simulate \nthe worst hot and cold (orbit average) orbital environmental conditions. The space-\ncraft operates in a steady state mode (without cycling loads or heaters) until the \nspacecraft attains steady state temperatures. At each balance point, it takes about \n12\u201324\u00a0h to reach stability (defined as a state where temperature variation is less than \n0.1\u00a0\u00b0C/h).\n\nThe test is conducted in a vacuum chamber with an LN2 shroud. The spacecraft \nis surrounded by heated (and sometimes cooled) high emittance plates (painted \nblack or black anodized). A six-sided spacecraft may have at least six heater plates \nsurrounding the spacecraft to represent the heat incident on each of the sides. If \nthere is more than one finish per spacecraft side, multiple plates at different tem-\nperatures may be placed opposite those spacecraft sides. The temperatures of the \nplates are set to present the spacecraft with an IR environment simulating the com-\nbined solar, Albedo and Earth IR fluxes. The combined simulated environment is \nreferred to as the Equivalent Sink Temperature. Since the actual heater plate emit-\ntance is 0.85\u20130.90, plate temperatures are adjusted to reproduce the Effective Sink \nTemperature. If it is necessary to reproduce equivalent sink temperatures below \n?50C\u00b0, the plate needs to be cooled (usually by GN2). Spacecraft power consump-\ntion has to be monitored during the Thermal Balance test.\n\nThe resulting steady state spacecraft temperatures are compared with the model \npredicted temperatures in a process called model correlation.\n\n12.9  Model Correlation to\u00a0Conform to\u00a0Thermal Test Data\n\nBefore the thermal model can be used to provide final flight temperature predic-\ntions, differences between actual test results, obtained during TVAC testing, and \nmodel predictions must be brought into agreement with one another. For this pur-\npose, the model must be altered to agree with test results. The methods to alter the \nmodel require considerable experience.\n\nAs an example, however, let us say that the temperature gradients in TVAC \nexceed those that the model predicted. In this case, the model thermal interface \nconductances may be adjusted until the temperatures and gradients agree.\n\n12.10  Final Flight Temperature Predictions\n\nAfter the model has been adjusted to make predictions that best match the Thermal \nBalance Test results, final temperature predictions are made for various important \npoints in the spacecraft and for various cases in the mission life of the spacecraft. \nIllustrative examples are given in Figs.\u00a012.9 and 12.10. In Fig.\u00a012.9, the rapid rise in \ntemperature of the 10 Watt transmitter is seen when it is turned on.\n\n12 Thermal Design\n\n\n\nFig. 12.9 Temperature ranges are acceptable. The impact  \nof the 10 Watt transmitter turning ON is evident\n\nFig. 12.10 Hot case. ADACS temperature approaches the  \nlimit of the acceptable temperature range\n\n\n\n203\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_13\n\nChapter 13\nRadiation Hardening, Reliability \nand\u00a0Redundancy\n\nThere are at least three factors that affect spacecraft orbit life. These are (1) the \namount of radiation protection provided for the orbit altitude of the spacecraft, (2) \nthe reliability of the components and of the spacecraft system and (3) the redun-\ndancy built into the spacecraft.\n\n13.1  Radiation Hardening\n\nThere are two kinds of radiation effects that can cause the spacecraft to fail: (1) total \nradiation dose and (2) single event upset (SEU).\n\n13.1.1  Total Dose\n\nTotal Radiation increases sharply with orbit altitude and linearly with time. \nProtection against total radiation can be achieved with shielding. The table in \nFig.\u00a013.1 shows the radiation environment in an aluminum shielded space as a func-\ntion of altitude, mission life in years and the thickness of the aluminum shield. \nSeveral cases are plotted in Fig.\u00a013.2a\u2013c.\n\nElectronic component vulnerabilities to radiation dose vary greatly from compo-\nnent to component. Most commercial CMOS parts range from 1 to 10 kRAD, while \nRAD hardened space qualified parts vulnerability is well over the 100 kRAD range. \nNASA maintains a parts list that provides data for the reliability as well as radiation \nhardness of components. RAD hard parts, of course, are very expensive, so a \ndesigner must consider radiation hardness mitigation by not only parts selection and \nshielding, but also by introducing redundancy in the electronics architecture. More \nwill be said about this later in this chapter.\n\n\n\n204\n\nFigure 13.2a shows that, if we use components that can operate to 10 kRAD total \ndose, a 5-year mission life can be achieved at up to 700\u00a0km altitude with a shielding \nthickness of 110 mils. Parts for this mission are relatively low cost. If the orbit is at \n1000\u00a0km altitude,180 mils of shielding would be needed for a 5-year mission. This \nwould increase the card cage weight from about 0.81\u00a0lb. to about 1.33\u00a0lb.\n\nSingle Event Upset is caused by a single, high energy particle striking a critical \npoint of a memory or an integrated circuit. The result can be either (1) the creation \nof a soft error, where a bit may change state, causing an error, but not the destruction \nof the circuit, or (2) a \u201clatchup\u201d may occur, destroying the circuit permanently. The \nonly certain way to mitigate against an SEU latchup is to select components that are \nnot prone to this kind of a latchup.\n\nShielding \nThickness\nMil AL\n\nTotal Dose (kRad) \n700 km for\n\nTotal Dose (kRad) \n1000 km for\n\nTotal Dose (kRad) \n2000 km for\n\n1 yr 5yrs 12yrs 1  yr 3 yrs 5 yrs 1 yr 5 yrs 12 yrs\n50 7.16 3S.80 85.92 14.00 42.00 70.00 164.68 82340 1976.16\n60 6.51 27.66 66.12 11.00 33.00 85.00 125.63 628.15 1507.86\n70 4.33 21.66 61.96 8.80 2640 44\u00a30 97.86 489.30 1174.32\n80 3.58 17,90 42.96 7.00 21.00 35.00 80.19 400.95 962.28\n90 2.96 14.80 35.52 5.80 1740 29.00 65.71 328.55 788.52\n\n100 247 12.36 29.64 5.00 16.00 25.00 54.34 271.70 652.08\n110 2.08 10.40 24.96 4.40 13.20 22.00 45.55 227.75 546.60\n120 1.83 9.1 S 21.96 3.90 11.70 19.50 39.89 199.45 478.68\n130 1.58 7.90 18.96 3.50 10.50 17.50 34.29 171.45 411.48\n140 1.38 6.90 16.66 3.10 9.30 15.50 29.81 149.05 357.72\n180 1.20 6.00 14.40 2.80 840 14,00 25.80 12100 309.19\n160 1.08 5.40 12.96 2.50 7.50 12.50 23.11 115.55 277.32\n170 0.96 4.80 11.52 2.20 6.60 11.00 20.45 102.25 245.40\n180 0.88 4.40 10.56 2.00 6.00 10.00 18.66 93.30 223.92\n190 0.79 3.96 9.46 1.84 5.52 9.20 16.67 83.38 200.04\n200 0.73 3.65 8.76 1.70 5.10 8.50 14.60 73.00 175.20\n210 0.67 3.35 8.04 1.60 4.80 8.00 13.33 66.65 159.96\n220 0.61 3.05 7.32 1.54 4.62 7.70 12.08 60.40 144.96\n230 0.68 2.90 6.96 1.50 4.50 7.50 11.43 57.15 137.16\n240 0.57 2.85 6.84 1.44 4.32 7.20 11.17 55.85 134.04\n260 0.55 2.75 6.60 1.40 4.20 7.00 10.73 53.65 128.76\n\nFig. 13.1 kRad radiation levels in aluminum shield  \nvs. number of years at various altitudes\n\n13 Radiation Hardening, Reliability and\u00a0Redundancy\n\n\n\n205\n\nFig. 13.2 (a) kRad dose vs. various aluminum shield thicknesses  \nand mission life (b) kRad dose vs. mission life and altitude for various  \n\naluminum shield thicknesses (c) Shield thickness vs. total kRad dose for  \nvarious altitudes and mission durations\n\n13.1 Radiation Hardening\n\n\n\n206\n\n13.2  Reliability\n\nThe designer must ensure that the spacecraft could achieve the desired mission life. \nIn order to do so, a reliability analysis must be undertaken. A system level reliability \nanalysis starts with a system reliability block diagram. This is a series arrangement \nof all the blocks in a block diagram that must each work for a spacecraft function to \noperate successfully. For example, a reliability diagram of the RF transmit portion \nof a spacecraft employing a single-string design is shown in Fig.\u00a013.3. The diagram \nreflects the connections of the boxes or functions that must each work. Redundant \nelements, like the batteries, are shown connected in parallel, indicating that if one \nfails, the system may still function.\n\nReliability is computed from the component failure rate, ? failures per hour. \nR\u00a0=\u00a0e-?T, where T is mission life in hours. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF or \nMean Time To Failure (MTTF) is 1/?. So, if a part has an MTBF of 500,000\u00a0H, over \na 5-year (43,800\u00a0H) mission, reliability is R\u00a0=\u00a0e-43,800/500.000\u00a0=\u00a00.91613. The Probability \nof Mission Failure over the 5\u00a0year period is PF\u00a0=\u00a01-R or 0.0837 or 8.37%. For 10\u00a0year \nlife and a PF of 10%, we need a system reliability, R\u00a0>\u00a00.89984. This is a system \nMTTF of 830,000\u00a0h.\n\nFig. 13.2 (continued)\n\n13 Radiation Hardening, Reliability and\u00a0Redundancy\n\n\n\n207\n\nIf a component, like a transmitter, is not used continuously, the duty cycle of \nutilization should be taken into account in the MTTF requirement. For example if a \ntransmitter is used for only 10\u00a0 min per 96\u00a0 min orbit, a 5-year mission life only \nrequires an MTTF of 43,500\u00a0h (for a probability of failure of 10%), and the reliabil-\nity requirement can be reduced to 0.90043.\n\nProbability that the transmitter will fail is: P(failure of transmitter)=\n=1\u20130.995\u00a0=\u00a00.005\u00a0=\u00a00.5%\nThe probability that one battery will fail is (1\u20130.89984)\u00a0=\u00a00.10016\u00a0=\u00a010.016%\nThe probability that both batteries will fail is 0.05\u00a0=\u00a05%\nThe reliability of the 2 parallel batteries is 1\u20130.05\u00a0=\u00a00.94992.\nNote how Battery Reliability has increased through use of two batteries.\nSystem reliability (from battery input to antenna output) is R\u00a0=\u00a00.9338, and the \n\nprobability of system failure is 0.0662 or 6.62%.\nThe reliability numbers for components are combined to obtain the reliability of \n\nthe system by:\n\n\u2022 Multiplying the Reliabilities of Series Elements together\n\u2022 If two components are in parallel, let P1\u00a0 =\u00a0 1-R1 and P2\u00a0 =\u00a0 R2 and compute \n\nR\u00a0=\u00a0(1-P1*P2/(P1\u00a0+\u00a0P2))\n\nSometimes, failure of a component does not end a mission, it only degrades per-\nformance. For example, if there are two redundant transmitters, loss of one does not \nreduce mission capability. If one of several solar arrays quits working, the mission \nis only degraded, not ended. Reliability calculations should take into account mis-\nsion degradation, not only mission failure.\n\n0.9980\n\n0.89984\n\n0.89984\n0.995 0.990\n\nSolar \n\nDC/DC\n\nBattery \n\nBattery \nTransmitter Antenna\n\nSolar\nB\n\nA\nC D E\n\nReliability = A*B/(A+B)*C*D*E =\n0.998*0. 995*0.990*(1-(1-0.89984)/2)=0.9338\n\nFig. 13.3 Reliability diagram\n\n13.2 Reliability\n\n\n\n208\n\n13.3  Redundancy\n\nIt is a common practice to use redundant components where the reliability of a com-\nponent is less than desired. It is for this reason that, usually, redundant transmitters, \nbatteries and other components are used in the spacecraft. While use of redundant \ncomponents increases the cost, size, complexity and weight of a spacecraft, it also \nsignificantly increases its probable mission life.\n\nRedundancy should be used judiciously and only where absolutely necessary, \nbecause redundancy increases system complexity and introduces new components \nwhose reliability must also be taken into consideration. Some of the applications for \nredundancy are:\n\n\u2022 Where a component is susceptible to failure by SEU\n\u2022 Where the component reliability is too low to meet mission requirements\n\u2022 To eliminate single points of failure in critical paths\n\u2022 When it is inexpensive to use a redundant component\n\nSo far, only hardware reliability and redundancy were discussed. However, use \nof redundancy measures also applies to spacecraft software. Some of the software \nredundancy measures are to:\n\n\u2022 Put multiple copies of the spacecraft operating software in EPROM memory\n\u2022 Use uploadable software\n\u2022 Use majority logic (perform the calculations in 3 processors simultaneously, and \n\nselect the result if at least 2 of the processors gave the same result). This requires \nhardware redundancy as well\n\n13 Radiation Hardening, Reliability and\u00a0Redundancy\n\n\n\n209\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_14\n\nChapter 14\nIntegration and\u00a0Test\n\nIntegration is the process of testing the components of the spacecraft, assembling \nthem, putting the completed spacecraft through functional testing, then performing \nthermal, vibration and thermal vacuum tests. After that, the spacecraft is ready to be \nshipped to the launch site, where it is functionally retested to ensure that no damage \nwas done to the spacecraft. Then, the spacecraft is integrated with the launch vehicle.\n\nThis process is accompanied by writing test plans for each of these tests.\nIntegration and Test typically takes about 3\u00a0months on a new spacecraft, and not \n\nmuch less on one that was previously built. A typical schedule is shown in Fig.\u00a014.1.\n\nFig. 14.1 Typical integration and test schedule\n\n14.1  Component Level Testing\n\nEach component (computer, radio, ADACS, etc.) is tested to ensure it meets func-\ntional specifications and the thermal and vibration environment it will see on orbit. \nThese tests are either performed by the vendor who supplies the component or by \nthe spacecraft team. For mature components that have been used in previous space-\ncraft, the vibration and thermal or thermal vacuum tests can be omitted, since these \ntests will later be performed on a finished spacecraft level.\n\n\n\n210\n\nDeployables must be tested to ensure that they will deploy in a zero G environ-\nment in space. Zero G environment can be simulated in the laboratory by suspend-\ning each part of the deployable structure with pulleys, cables and counterweights. \nDeployment should be interrupted and restarted to ensure that the deployment does \nnot rely on the inertia of a moving part. Figure\u00a014.2 illustrates a large, deployable \nsolar array being deployed in the laboratory while simulating zero G.\n\nFig. 14.2 Simulating zero G while deploying a large solar array  \n(By permission from Orbital-ATK)\n\n14 Integration and\u00a0Test\n\n\n\n211\n\nThere should be a sufficient supply of pyro devices, if they are used, to permit \nrepeated deployment of pyro-initiated deployables.\n\nThe spacecraft structure undergoes static load and vibration testing. These are \nusually performed before the spacecraft components are assembled and integrated \nwith the structure. For vibration testing the structure, usually mass mockups of the \nelectronics are used.\n\n14.1.1  The \u201cFlat-Sat\u201d\n\nIt is important to start the integration and test process as soon as possible, even \nbefore most of the mechanical hardware is available. For this purpose, a \u201cFlat-Sat\u201d \nshould be built. This is a flat surface or table onto which the spacecraft components \n(or duplicates, if available) are laid out and harnessed with a functional duplicate of \nthe spacecraft harness. The result is the spacecraft electronics integrated on a flat \nsurface. This is called a \u201cFlat-Sat.\u201d\n\nThe Flat-Sat is populated with the electronics subsystems when they are ready, \nresulting in an early functional test of each subsystem, and, eventually, of the entire \nspacecraft. Availability of a Flat-Sat can speed up the integration process.\n\nIt is at this level that conceptual and technical problems can be discovered and \nfixed. Aside from hardware problems, most problems discovered are software \nrelated. Not that the software does not work as specified. The problem most often is \nthat the software, as specified, is not as intended, and the software must be revised. \nTo discover the problems and to \u201cdebug\u201d the system a Flat-Sat level test is most \nuseful.\n\n14.2  Spacecraft Level Tests\n\nThe Objectives of Functional Tests are, basically, to get the assembled spacecraft \nworking as the system it is intended to be. So, functional testing involves verifying \nthat all components of the spacecraft can be turned on and off via ground command \nthrough the Electronics Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) speaking with the \nC&DH.\u00a0This is followed by exercising the telemetry collection capabilities, then the \nability to transmit telemetry to the EGSE (bypassing the RF link). Then, all the \nuploadable commands are exercised, and the ability of the spacecraft to perform \nthose commands is tested. Similarly, correct performance of commands to the pay-\nload and outputs from the payload are verified. Finally, the entire system is operated \nthrough the RF links.\n\nRF link performance is tested at an antenna range. Antenna patterns are mea-\nsured when the antennas are mounted on the spacecraft. In this way, the effect of the \nspacecraft on the antenna patterns is checked.\n\n14.2 Spacecraft Level Tests\n\n\n\n212\n\nRF signals from (and to) the spacecraft must be attenuated to simulate the mini-\nmum detectable signal levels. Often, it may be difficult to near-impossible in a labo-\nratory, or even in an open range environment, to achieve enough attenuation to \nproperly simulate the minimum detectable signal levels. So, one must do the best \none can.\n\nTesting the ADACS is particularly difficult. It is best done if an ADACS Dynamic \nSimulator is available. This hardware (and software), through the EGSE cable, takes \nthe outputs of the spacecraft actuators (reaction wheel speeds, torque rod activities \nand the spacecraft instantaneous position\u00a0- calculated by the on-board ADACS com-\nputer). The Dynamic Simulator, shown in Fig.\u00a014.3a, connected to the spacecraft \nADACS computer, computes the vector magnetic and solar environments corre-\nsponding to the present position of the spacecraft, simulates disturbance torques and \nsolves the equations of motion to predict what the spacecraft attitude will be and \nfeeds corresponding magnetic and solar vector information back to the ADACS.\u00a0In \nthis way, a \u201chardware-in-the-loop\u201d simulation of the spacecraft flight is obtained. \nThe spacecraft instantaneous attitude is also pictured on the Dynamic Simulator \ndisplay, shown in Fig.\u00a014.3b.\n\n14.3  Environmental Testing\n\n14.3.1  Vibration Tests\n\nVibration tests are typically used to qualify the spacecraft for the launch environ-\nment. These tests usually include sine, sine-burst, and random test cycles. The first \ndecision to be made is the choice of the facility where the test will be performed. \nThe two primary considerations in choosing a test facility are the capability of the \nvibration table and the number of instrumentation channels available. The vibration \ntable must be able to drive the spacecraft and all the test fixtures to the desired vibra-\ntion spectra. In the case of the sine-burst test, it should be able to drive the spacecraft \nto the desired acceleration at a frequency lower than 1/3rd the lowest spacecraft \nfrequency. The second consideration is the number of instrumentation channels the \nfacility can support. Each axis of measurement requires one channel. For example, \na triax, which measures accelerations in three axes, requires three channels. The \nnumber of channels required is up to the discretion of the structural engineer. In \ntheory, a test can be performed without instrumenting the spacecraft at all; as long \nas the spacecraft withstands the test environment without failing, the test is a suc-\ncess. It would be taking a significant risk, especially during random vibration test-\ning, but it would be acceptable.\n\nAn interface fitting must be fabricated to attach the spacecraft to the vibration \ntable. The test facility will provide the bolt pattern for bolting to the table. There \nmay be two different bolt patterns, one for the lateral test table and the other for the \nvertical test table. The interface fitting should have a very high resonant frequency \n\n14 Integration and\u00a0Test\n\n\n\n213\n\n(>1000\u00a0Hz) when constrained at the test table bolt pattern with the spacecraft mod-\neled as a concentrated mass, at its center of gravity, and attached to the interface \nfitting, using an RBE3. The fitting should be as light as possible, as the combined \nmass of the fitting with the spacecraft mass has to be driven during test. If possible, \n\nThe Dynamic Simulator Display Contains:\n\u00b7 Commanded and Actual Reaction Wheel Speeds (3) vs. Time\n\u00b7 Commanded and Actual Torquer Activities vs. Time\n\u00b7 Earth Magnetic Field Components in Inertial Coordinates vs. Time\n\u00b7 Magnetic Field Components in Spacecraft Coordinates\n\u00b7 Reaction Wheel Torque Commands (3) vs. Time\n\u00b7 Sun Vector Components vs. Time\n\u00b7 Spacecraft Velocity vs. Time\n\u00b7 Spacecraft Position vs. Time\n\u00b7 Spacecraft Attitude vs. Time\n\u00b7 Spacecraft Attitude Picture vs. Time (in Ram and Side View vs. Time)\n\na\n\nb\n\nSpacecraft Position\n\nADACS Dynamic\nSimulator\n\nC&DHSpacecraft ADACS\nComputer\n\nS\np\n\nac\nec\n\nra\nft\n\n P\no\n\nsi\nti\n\no\nn\n\nS\np\n\nac\nec\n\nra\nft\n\n A\ntt\n\nit\nu\n\nd\ne\n\n3 Reaction Wheel Speeds\n\n3 Torque Rod Currents\n\nM\nag\n\nn\net\n\nic\n F\n\nie\nld\n\n V\nec\n\nto\nr\n\nS\nu\n\nn\n V\n\nec\nto\n\nr\n\nFig. 14.3 (a) Hardware in the loop simulator (b) Dynamic simulator \u201cflies\u201d  \nthe spacecraft in the \u201chardware-in-the loop\u201d laboratory test setup\n\n14.3 Environmental Testing\n\n\n\n214\n\nthe interface fitting should not bolt to the vibration table beneath the spacecraft, as \nthis would require unbolting the spacecraft from the fitting before reorienting the \nassembly on the table between test axes.\n\nDuring tests, the spacecraft is in the launch configuration, thermal blankets are \ntypically not installed, and the spacecraft is unpowered. A lightweight bag that \nallows the attachment of accelerometers is placed over the spacecraft. Lifting hard-\nware, which is not part of the flight configuration, is removed. Solar arrays are \ninstalled and latched in the stowed configuration.\n\nTesting is a relatively expensive activity and is usually charged by the time spent \nin the facility. During testing, the structural/test engineer is responsible for the hard-\nware. Typically, the test facility people will answer questions about what the capa-\nbility of their facility is, but they will not provide any guidance about the test levels \nor procedures. Any deviations to the written test plan will require a written note on \nthe plan along with a signature. Because of this environment, it is imperative that a \nfull pretest analysis be performed before arriving at the test facility. This pretest \nanalysis should include FEM runs for all the test cases along with printed results of \nthe responses at each accelerometer location. From the pre-test, it should become \nobvious which test cycle is critical (produces the lowest margin of safety). If the test \nis run in multiple axes, there will be one that is most critical. Beginning in the non- \ncritical axes can be used to gain knowledge about the structure before applying the \ncritical test loads. The order of testing in each axis can also be used to verify the \ninstrumentation before testing at the higher levels. The first and last test cycles in \neach axis will be signature cycles (either sine or random). Sine signature cycles \nnormally run from 5\u20132000\u00a0Hz. and random signatures run from 20\u20132000\u00a0Hz. Either \nsignature method is acceptable. The before and after response plots at each acceler-\nometer are compared against each other to verify that the hardware has not failed \nduring the test.\n\nThe low level sine sweep is at 0.1\u00a0G over the range of 5\u20132000\u00a0Hz (4 oct/min) in \nall 3 axes.\n\nTypical low level sine signature vibration test levels\n\nTest axis\nFrequency\n(Hz)\n\nAmplitude\nG\u2019s (peak) Sweep rate (octaves/minute)\n\nXYZ\u00a0- axis 5\u20132000 0.10 4.0\n\nThe test sequence is, in each axis, the sine, sine-burst, and then random vibration. \nThe sine and sine-burst tests are easily compared to the pretest analysis predictions. \nThey allow the engineer to verify that the instrumentation is working and producing \nthe expected responses. During the random test, all the spacecraft modes over the \nentire frequency range are excited. Up until this time, all of the analysis was run \nusing a model, uncorrelated to test data. The test results provide the first indication \nof how accurate the model is. Some of the modes may couple, creating higher \n\n14 Integration and\u00a0Test\n\n\n\n215\n\nresponses than predicted. While the sine and sine-burst tests will typically produce \nexpected responses, it is not uncommon for the random responses to vary signifi-\ncantly from the pretest predictions.\n\nIn order to avoid accidentally overstressing the spacecraft during testing, the \ninput levels are increased incrementally using multiple test cycles. During these \ncycles, the load levels are usually defined as dB levels. The table below shows the \ncorrelation between dB level and full test load level.\n\ndB % Test load\n\n?18 12.5%\n?12 25.0%\n?6 50.0%\n?3 75.0%\n0 100.0%\n\nFor example, when reviewing the ?12\u00a0dB cycle results for the sine or sine burst \ntests, the response values should be approximately 25% of the expected full level \nresponses.\n\nTypical sine vibration levels are shown in the table below:\n\nSine vibration test levels\n\nTest Axis Frequency (Hz)\nLevel\n(peak) Sweep rate octaves/min\n\nProto-flight Thrust 5\u201320 7.4\u00a0g 4\nLateral 5\u201320 4.0\u00a0g 4\n\nTypical Sine Burst test levels are shown below:\n\nSine burst test levels\n\nTest axis Test description Test requirement (g)\n\nXY Sine burst at TBD Hz (5\u00a0cycles \nfull-level)\n\n5.00\n\nZ Sine burst at TBD Hz (5\u00a0cycles \nfull-level)\n\n9.25\n\nNote: The sine-burst test level is typically 1.25 times the design load level. This is accommodated \nduring analysis by the 1.25 yield factor included in the stress margins of safety calculations.\n\nRandom testing is considered a workmanship test, not a structural test. This is \nimportant to consider when running a random test. During launch, when the space-\ncraft is attached to the launch vehicle, the launch vehicle is a flexible constraint. If \none of the spacecraft modes takes off, its interface loads to the launch vehicle \n\n14.3 Environmental Testing\n\n\n\n216\n\nincrease, but the spacecraft flexibility may damp out some of these loads. Static \ndesign loads are based on measured loads (from previous launches) or from coupled \nloads analysis (CLA). These take this damping into account. Therefore, from the \nstandpoint of strength, the spacecraft is only required to sustain 1.25 times the \ndesign loads. The sine-burst test is the strength test. On the other hand, during vibra-\ntion testing the spacecraft is mounted to a vibration table that provides no damping. \nSo, if one of the spacecraft modes takes off during testing, the response may be \nmuch larger than that which would be seen during flight. Because of this phenom-\nenon, during random testing it is permitted to limit the input levels. Limiting is \naccomplished in one of two ways:\n\n 1. Force Limiting: Force gages are installed at each of the bolts attaching the inter-\nface plate to the vibration table, and the loads measured are used to limit the \noverall spacecraft net CG accelerations to the static design loads. This is a rela-\ntively complicated/expensive procedure and is mostly used on large spacecraft.\n\n 2. Notching: The random input spectrum is manually changed to notch the input \nlevels at discrete frequencies where responses are high. This method is inexpen-\nsive and is used frequently.\n\nThe guidelines for notching the input over a discrete frequency range:\n\n 1. Maximum limiting over a discrete frequency range is ?12\u00a0dB\n 2. The overall GRMS input value cannot be reduced by more than 10% from the un- \n\nnotched value\n\nNotching input levels is an iterative operation. For a given accelerometer loca-\ntion, the ?18\u00a0dB random load test cycle GRMS response results are reviewed. These \nGRMS acceleration responses are 1/8th of the full level loads. So, by multiplying the \n?18\u00a0dB responses by eight is an estimate of full level 1-sigma loads. Then multiply \nthe 1-sigma loads by 3 to get the 3-sigma loads. If the structure cannot withstand the \n3-sigma loads at an accelerometer location, the need for notching is indicated. \nReturn to the ?18\u00a0dB results and look at the plotted response levels; notch the input \nspectrum over the frequency range where the responses are significantly above the \ninput level. When the new input spectrum is used in the table software, it will pro-\nvide the overall input spectrum GRMS so it could be verified to be within 10% of the \nnominal spectrum. Rerun the ?18\u00a0dB random test load cycle (using the notched \ninput) and determine if the new 3-sigma loads are acceptable. If they are, continue \ntesting by increasing input levels. If the response is excessive, widening the notch \nmay be required.\n\nWhile the random test is not considered a strength test, it is a very good work-\nmanship test. It is especially good at causing fasteners to back out if they are not \nadequately torqued.\n\nIn the absence of specific launch vehicle vibe spectra, GEVS vibration levels \nshould be used.\n\n14 Integration and\u00a0Test\n\n\n\n217\n\nRandom Vibration test levels for all 3 axes should be 14 (Grms). The levels are \nshown below (Fig.\u00a014.4).\n\nRandom vibration test levels\n\nFrequency (Hz) Protoflight (G2/Hz)\n\n20 0.026\n20\u201350 +6.0\u00a0dB/Oct\n50\u2013800 0.16\n800\u20132000 ?6.0\u00a0dB/Oct\n2000 0.026\nOverall (Grms) 14.0\nDuration (min) 1\n\nIn summary, the spacecraft should undergo a full suite of vibe testing in three \naxes, including sine, sine-burst, and proto-flight random testing. Low level sine or \nrandom surveys should be run before and after each test to verify that the modes \nhave not changed significantly. Limited performance tests may be run after tests are \ncomplete for each axis and prior to re-configuring for the next axis.\n\nFig. 14.4 Random protoflight test levels\n\n14.3 Environmental Testing\n\n\n\n218\n\nTypical test tolerances are shown below\n\nSine vibration\nSinusoidal amplitude \u00b110%\nVibration frequency \u00b1 2%\nRandom vibration\nAcceleration spectral density +/? 3\u00a0dB\nOverall RMS +/? 10%\nDuration +10, ?0%\nSine burst\nSinusoidal amplitude \u00b15%\n\n14.3.2  Thermal Test\n\nThe purposes of the thermal tests are (1) to uncover latent defects by thermally \nstressing the spacecraft, (2) to demonstrate successful spacecraft operation over a \nwide temperature range and (3) to gather temperature data to assess part, board and \nassembly gradients. The test success criteria are:\n\nObjective Success criteria\n\nUncover latent defects Demonstrate failure free three (3) cycles between \nHOT and COLD temperatures\n\nDemonstrate spacecraft operation and \nestablish performance\n\nDemonstrate compliant operation over the range of \ntemperatures and during\nTemperature transitions\n\nAssess part, board and assembly \ngradients\n\nGather steady state temperature data\n\nThe spacecraft in the thermal chamber is connected to the ground station (or \nEGSE) and the Dynamic Simulator. The ground station supplies electronic stimuli \nneeded for functional testing.\n\nFirst a thermal balance test is conducted. The thermal chamber should be able to \ncontrol temperature over at least ?40C and +55C at a rate of at least 3\u00a0 \u00b0C/min. \nChamber temperature gradients during the test should not exceed 4\u00a0\u00b0C/s. A data \nacquisition system should monitor and store chamber and spacecraft test point tem-\nperatures. Spacecraft telemetry should be collected by the ground station. \nEnvironmental stability is reached when the chamber is within 2\u00a0 \u00b0C of desired \nsetpoint.\n\nSteady State Temperature Test The spacecraft should operate in the chamber for \na minimum of 90\u00a0min at each of six steady state temperatures. These are +20\u00a0\u00b0C, \n+35\u00a0 \u00b0C, 0\u00b0, ?10\u00a0 \u00b0C, +45\u00a0 \u00b0C and ?25\u00a0 \u00b0C.\u00a0 The spacecraft should operate in a \nrepeating scripted scenario of 30\u00a0min duration; and the scenario should be repeated \n\n14 Integration and\u00a0Test\n\n\n\n219\n\nthree times during each 90\u00a0min test. Telemetry is read and archived during each \n90\u00a0min test.\n\nDynamic Thermal Test The temperature chamber is cycled three times between \n+35\u00b0 and ?25\u00a0\u00b0C while the spacecraft operates with the scripted scenario. Transition \nbetween the hot and cold temperature limits should not take less than 15\u00a0min (4\u00b0 per \nmin), dwelling 45\u00a0min at the hot or the cold temperature limits. An entire cycle takes \n2\u00a0h. Three failure-free cycles should be performed. The Dynamic Test takes 6\u00a0h \n(Fig.\u00a014.5).\n\nFig. 14.5 Dynamic thermal test temperature profile\n\n14.3.3  Bakeout\n\nThe objective of this (optional) test is to outgas spacecraft components to preclude \nthe risk of condensable volatile contamination. Prior to bakeout, the spacecraft is \nsubjected to thermal cycling at ambient pressure. Chamber cleanliness certification \nis a prerequisite to integrating the spacecraft into the TVAC chamber. Immediately \nprior to integration, the chamber with all internal GSE should be certified to the \ncontamination criteria of 300\u00a0 Hz/h rate @60\u00a0 \u00b0C on a\u00a0 ?20\u00a0 \u00b0C Quartz Crystal \nMicrobalance (QCM).\n\nObjective Success criteria\n\nComplete outgas at \n40\u00a0\u00b0C\n\nTQCM at ?20C measurement of contamination levels should drop \nbelow a specified limit\n\n14.3 Environmental Testing\n\n\n\n220\n\nThe spacecraft and its TVAC GSE are installed in the thermal vacuum bake-\nout chamber. The chamber is maintained at less than 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010?5\u00a0torr and at +40\u00a0\u00b0C \nduring test. The Data Acquisition System records temperatures in real time and \ncontinuously monitors and compares against alarms of spacecraft temperatures. \nThe spacecraft has achieved bakeout when the TQCM rate of change is no more \nthan 300HzTBR per hour and for at least 100\u00a0hours at TQCM rate past the knee \nof the curve.\n\n14.3.4  Thermal Vacuum Test\n\nThe objectives of the thermal vacuum TVAC test are to:\n\n 1. Validate the thermal design by subjecting the SC to thermal test environments \nthat conservatively simulate the flight hot and cold environments\n\n 2. Achieve hot and cold steady state temperatures and gather steady state and tran-\nsient data in order to correlate the thermal models\n\n 3. Operate the spacecraft and payload in a manner similar to flight operations\n 4. Operate the spacecraft at temperatures in excess of those expected on orbit\n\nThe compliance matrix illustrates how the test objectives are to be achieved dur-\ning test:\n\nObjective Compliance criteria\n\nValidate the thermal design Subject the SC to test environments simulating the flight hot \nand cold environments and verify that all temperatures are \nwithin limits with margin\n\nAchieve hot and cold steady \nstate temperatures\n\nTemperatures stable\n\nGather steady state data in order \nto correlate the thermal models.\n\nTB stability criteria must be achieved so that data collected is \nuseful\n\nOperate similarly to flight \noperations\n\nDemonstrate acceptable temperature increases during peak \norbital load profile\n\nOperate in environments excess \nof expected flight temperature\n\nAchieve temperatures in excess of those expected in flight\n\nOperation Demonstrate failure-free operation while hot, cold and during \ntemperature transitions\n\nThe test is conducted with an LN2 shroud. The spacecraft is attached to the \nTVAC test fixture, which is conductively isolated from the chamber. The spacecraft \nmain radiator is coupled to the chamber cold wall, and the side radiators are radia-\ntively coupled to zone heaters which, in turn, are coupled to the shroud. The steps in \nthe TVAC test are the following:\n\nPumpdown \u2013 during pumpdown, spacecraft operation is consistent with launch to \ndemonstrate insensitivity to corona during ascent. The TVAC chamber is purged \n\n14 Integration and\u00a0Test\n\n\n\n221\n\nwith dry LN2 to prevent condensation; the spacecraft is in the launch configuration, \nthe TVAC chamber is evacuated and spacecraft temperatures are monitored to make \nsure that temperatures do not become excessive. Once chamber pressure reaches \n5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010?5\u00a0torr, pumpdown is completed.\n\nHot Balance\u00a0\u2013 Hot Balance demonstrates spacecraft thermal performance in the \nwarmest expected environment. Once the hot balance begins, the spacecraft should \noperate with no power changes.\n\nCold Balance\u00a0 \u2013 The Cold Balance test demonstrates spacecraft thermal perfor-\nmance in the coldest expected environment.\n\nCold Survival Balance\u00a0\u2013 This test proves that the spacecraft can stay above the \nminimum survival temperatures when the spacecraft is in the low power mode.\n\nHot Cycle\u00a0\u2013 This segment of the TVAC test demonstrates proper spacecraft opera-\ntion and temperature response while cycling between high dissipation and low \npower operation.\n\n14.3 Environmental Testing\n\n\n\n223\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_15\n\nChapter 15\nLaunch Vehicles and\u00a0Payload Interfaces\n\nThere are two essential ingredients one must have in interfacing with launch vehicles: \nmoney and patience. The selection and manifesting process is long, schedules are uncer-\ntain, and a launch failure on an earlier flight could introduce additional years of delay.\n\nThe launch vehicle selection process depends on whether the satellite is a large space-\ncraft that would be the primary payload of the launch vehicle, or if it is small and would \nbe a secondary payload. If the latter, the main criteria for selecting a launch vehicle are:\n\n\u2022 Is there a launch already scheduled that has secondary payload volume and \nweight available in the time frame when your spacecraft would be completed?\n\n\u2022 Will the (primary payload) launch go to your required inclination and altitude?\n\u2022 Where is the launch site; and is it possible, including political and regulatory \n\nfactors, to arrange launching from there?\n\u2022 Are the launch and insurance costs within budget?\n\nIf a suitable compromise among the above factors can be reached, the main tasks \nin the launch vehicle selection process are completed.\n\n15.1  Present Launch Vehicles\n\nThere are 10 USA, 2 Chinese, 2 EU, 4 families of Russian, and 5 other (Indian, \nJapanese, Israeli) launch vehicles that fly to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) active today; \nseveral others are in development. A list of these launch vehicles, their lift capabili-\nties to LEO, maximum accelerations and their launch sites are given in the Appendix. \nThe data was extracted from the websites of each launch vehicle.

By this time, the rocket is out of most of the \natmosphere, but there is enough atmosphere left that the spacecraft must consider \n\n15 Launch Vehicles and\u00a0Payload Interfaces\n\n\n\n225\n\natmospheric heating. Atmospheric pressure at fairing separation is typically down to \n?0.2\u00a0psi. The second stage lifts and inserts the spacecraft into the required orbit, and \nthe spacecraft is separated from the launch vehicle. During ascent, telemetry from \nthe rocket (and often from the spacecraft) is sent to the ground. If there are multiple \npayloads, the launch vehicle releases them in sequence. Launch vehicles that have \nliquid propulsion systems (like SpaceX Falcon 9) can restart the last stage engine \nand can deploy different secondary payloads into different orbits.\n\nThe various presently active launch vehicles, including those not listed above, \nare described in the Appendix. The information was extracted from each launch \nvehicle payload user manuals. As stated earlier, this information is approximate and \nsubject to change.\n\nDepending on the desired orbit inclination, there may be launch site limitations \nthat prohibit launching into some orbit inclinations. For example, from the Eastern \nTest Range, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), spacecraft can only be \nlaunched within an azimuth of ?39\u00b0 and +57\u00b0; so Polar launches are not possible \nfrom CCAFS.\u00a0The reason for the +57\u00b0 maximum inclination limitation is because \nat greater inclinations spent boosters would be dropped onto the populated US East \nCoast. Similarly, from VAFB, launch azimuth is limited between ?70\u00b0 and ?104\u00b0, \nso spacecraft can be launched into the popular Polar orbit from VAFB.\n\n15.2  Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Interfaces\n\nSince the cost of a launch service is principally paid for by the primary payload, \nsecondary payloads riding on the same launch pay much less by any measure. For \nthis reason, it is important to review how to interface with the various launch vehi-\ncles as a secondary payload.\n\nSeveral launch vehicles offer secondary payload accommodations as long as they \ndo not interfere with the primary payload. Since the secondary payload market is a \nfast growing segment of the spacecraft industry, more launch vehicles will offer \nsecondary payload launch services in the future. The payload (spacecraft) interface \nrequirements depend on the launch vehicle. However, there is a degree of standard-\nization emerging through development of secondary payload adapters like the ESPA \nring, Secondary Payload Adapter (SPA) and the Evolved Expendable Launch \nVehicle (EELV). For the Atlas V launch vehicle, these secondary payload options \nare shown in Fig.\u00a015.3. Ariane uses an ESPA secondary payload ring, as shown in \nFig.\u00a015.4a. Other launch vehicles use their own approaches to secondary payload \naccommodation. Figure\u00a015.4b shows multiple payloads on Dnepr.\n\nAn excellent survey of secondary adapters is contained in a report of the 17th \nAnnual Small Payload Rideshare Symposium held at the John Hopkins University \nApplied Physics Laboratory. The report is up-to-date as of June 2015. Much of the \ninformation in this subsection was extracted from that report.\n\n15.2  Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Interfaces\n\n\n\n226\n\nFig. 15.3 Secondary payload adapters for Atlas V (Atlas V launch services user\u2019s guide)\n\nFig. 15.4 (a) Multiple secondary payloads on Ariane.

For payloads that require reduced vibration levels, Moog also \nbuilds the SoftRide vibration isolation system that can reduce the launch vehicle \nvibration environment as seen by the spacecraft by as much as a factor of 10. Current \nstandard interfaces are listed in Fig.\u00a015.6.\n\nFig. 15.4 (continued)\n\nFig. 15.5 ESPA secondary payload adapter (Courtesy of Moog Inc., Space  \nand Defense Group)\n\nMost Separation Systems with which the spacecraft is attached to the launch \nvehicle or to the secondary payload adapters are explosive Marman Bands or the \nnon-explosive motorized clamp bands. The latter are the Lightband family (Planetary \nSystems, Corp.) motorized clamps. Both are shown in Fig.\u00a015.7a, b.\n\n15.2  Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Interfaces\n\n\n\nDiameter (in) No Fasteners Launch Vehicles\n\n62.01 120 \u00bc\" Atlas V, Delta IV, Falcon 9, Minotaur IV, V, VI\n38.81 60 \u00bc\" Minotaur I, Athena, Taurus, Pegasus\n24.00 36 \u00bc\" ESPA Grande, CubeStack\n15.00 24 \u00bc\" ESPA, Atlas V, Athena\n8.00 12 \u00bc\" Small Launch ESPA, Athena\n\nFig. 15.6 Secondary payload interfaces (APL report on June 15, 2015)\n\nFig. 15.7 (a) A RUAG sep system.

The original \nlauncher was for a single U (10\u00a0cm cube) spacecraft. More recently, launchers for \nlarger, multiple U-size spacecraft have been developed. The interfaces between the \nCubeSat spacecraft and the launcher are precise and rigid and are controlled by an \nInterface Control Document.\n\nFig. 15.8 The original cal poly launcher and a 6\u00a0U CubeSat launcher\n\n15.3  Secondary Payload Environment\n\nThe payload spacecraft must meet, and be able to survive, the launch vehicle vibra-\ntion, acoustic, pressure, RF, and other requirements.\n\n15.3.1  Vibration Levels\n\nVibration requirements have already been described. In case no information is yet \navailable for a specific adapter, design to the GEVS environment, Fig.\u00a015.9b. Note \nthat what is given as the axial acceleration may become the lateral acceleration for \nhorizontally mounted payloads, such as those mounted on an ESPA ring. The GEVS \nand the Dnepr vibration environments are shown in Fig.\u00a015.9a, b.\n\n15.3  Secondary Payload Environment\n\n\n\n230\n\nFig. 15.9 (a) Dnepr vibration spectra. (b) GEVS and ESPA vibration spectra\n\n15 Launch Vehicles and\u00a0Payload Interfaces\n\n\n\n231\n\nIf no other information is available, design to 9\u00a0G axial and 3\u00a0G lateral accelera-\ntions. These can be relaxed when the launch vehicle organization is able to provide \nmore specific information. The above spectral levels are tabulated in Fig.\u00a015.10.\n\n15.3.2  Mass Properties\n\nCenter of gravity must be within typically \u00b10.25? of the vertical axis of the space-\ncraft (to minimize tipoff at launch vehicle-spacecraft separation).\n\nThe CG position must also be known to within \u00b10.25?.\nThe center of gravity must not be above a certain launch vehicle-dependent dis-\n\ntance from the launch vehicle-payload interface level.\nMoments of inertia must be known to an accuracy of typically \u00b15% or \u00b10.5 slug-ft2.\nThe lowest resonant frequency must be greater than 50\u00a0Hz for some launch vehi-\n\ncles and greater than 20\u00a0Hz for others. The first spacecraft bending mode frequency \nshould be above 8\u00a0Hz.\n\n15.3.3  Insertion, Separation and\u00a0Recontact\n\nTypical launch vehicle insertion accuracies are \u00b118\u00a0 km in altitude and <0.2\u00b0 in \ninclination. Launch vehicle spacecraft separation velocity is usually 2\u20133\u00a0 ft./sec. \nTipoff is usually less than 1\u00b0 per second.\n\nThe possibility that the spacecraft will recontact the launch vehicle must be ana-\nlyzed. Often the launch vehicle makes a small maneuver after releasing the space-\ncraft to avoid recontact.\n\n15.3.4  RF Environment\n\nUsually, the spacecraft is not permitted to radiate RF energy at the launch site. For \nthis reason, provision should be made to radiate into a dummy load on the space-\ncraft for all ground tests at the launch site. Some spacecraft are launched without \ntesting the RF link at the launch site.\n\nGEVS ESPA\nFrequency (Hz) Qual Level Acceptance\n\n20 g2/Hz 0.026 0.013\n20 50 dB/oct 6 6\n50 800 g2/Hz 0.16 0.08\n\n800 2000 dB/oct -6 -6\n2000 g2/Hz 0.026 0.013\n\nOverall g RMS 14.1 10\nDuration sec 60 60\n\nFrequency (Hz) Qual Level Acceptance\n20 g2/Hz 0.014 0.007\n\n20 50 dB/oct 12.85 12.85\n50 70 g2/Hz 0.7 0.35\n70 100 dB/oct -4.72 -4.72\n\n100 250 g2/Hz 0.4 0.2\n250 400 dB/oct -6.72 -6.72\n400 900 0.14 0.07\n\n2000 g2/Hz 0.02 0.01\nOverall g RMS 16.18 11.44\n\nDuration sec 60 60\n\nFig. 15.10 GEVS and ESPA qual and acceptance vibe levels\n\n15.3  Secondary Payload Environment\n\n\n\n232\n\nSince there are intentional and unintentional RF emissions from various sources \nat the launch site, the spacecraft must be able to withstand these RF emissions. \nTypically, unintentional RF emissions may be as high as 114 dB?V/m in the 14\u00a0kHz \nto 18\u00a0GHz frequency range. Intentional emissions maybe as high as 160 dB?V/m \nfrom launch vehicle transmitters at specific (typically S-Band) frequencies.\n\nEach launch site publishes its RF environment, and these publications are readily \navailable.\n\nSpacecraft RF emissions must be less than 114 dB?V/m in the 14 KHz to \n350\u00a0MHz range, less than 140 dB?/m between 350\u00a0MHz and 1\u00a0GHz and less than \n169 dB?V/m above 1\u00a0GHz.\n\n15.3.5  Acoustic Environment\n\nOften, acoustically-induced spacecraft vibrations can drive the vibration environ-\nment. The launch vehicle will provide the acoustic spectrum seen by the spacecraft. \nAn example (for Atlas V) is shown in Fig.\u00a015.11.\n\nFig. 15.11 A typical payload acoustic environment  \n(Permission by United Launch Alliance)\n\n15.3.6  Shock Environment\n\nTypical shock the spacecraft may be subjected to is shown in Fig.\u00a015.12.\n\n15 Launch Vehicles and\u00a0Payload Interfaces\n\n\n\n233\n\n15.3.7  Additional Spacecraft Environmental and\u00a0Other Factors\n\nIn addition to the above environmental matters, there are additional factors that the \nspacecraft must take into consideration. These include:\n\n\u2022 EMI/EMC\n\u2022 Contamination\n\u2022 Spacecraft Fueling\n\u2022 Liquid Fuel Slosh Frequency (accurate to 2\u00a0Hz)\n\u2022 Payload Access Door Location on the fairing and umbilical cable routing\n\nIn addition, the spacecraft should be designed to have removable lifting fixtures, \nand, if horizontally mated to the launch vehicle, there should be a mating fixture that \ncan turn the spacecraft from a vertical to a horizontal position.\n\n15.4  Analyses, Documentation and\u00a0Other Factors\n\nMany analyses and documents are required to satisfy the launch vehicle organiza-\ntion. Examples of some are listed below:\n\n\u2022 Range Safety\n\u2022 Coupled Loads Analysis (performed by the launch vehicle from FEM provided \n\nby the spacecraft)\n\nFig. 15.12 Typical shock environment (Permission by United Launch Alliance)\n\n15.4  Analyses, Documentation and\u00a0Other Factors\n\n\n\n234\n\n\u2022 Finite Element Model of the spacecraft\n\u2022 Spacecraft-Launch Vehicle Interface Control Drawing (ICD), containing:\n\n \u2013 Mechanical ICD\n \u2013 Electrical ICD\n\n\u2022 Mission Analysis and Payload Integration\n\u2022 Safety Reviews\n\u2022 Launch Readiness Review\n\n15 Launch Vehicles and\u00a0Payload Interfaces\n\n\n\n235\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_16\n\nChapter 16\nGround Stations and\u00a0Ground Support \nEquipment\n\nGround stations (1) command the spacecraft(s), (2) collect, display and analyze \nspacecraft telemetry about its state of health and (3) command payloads and retrieve \ndata from them.\n\nSome agencies and customers of spacecraft require the use of, and compatibility \nwith, existing ground stations and two-way communication systems. There are sev-\neral good ground station software packages available that require little tailoring to \nadapt to a specific spacecraft. Most of them use numerical rather than graphic dis-\nplays. Regardless of whether one of those or a design-from-scratch ground station \nis used, most of the requirements are the same. These will be described next.\n\n16.1  Ground Stations\n\nGround Station Requirements Experience has shown that ground station (GS) \nrequirements can easily be given in terms of questions a visitor to the GS may ask. \nThe first question he or she may ask: \u201cWhere is the spacecraft now?\u201d The GS should \nbe able to show a map of the world and the instantaneous position of the spacecraft \non it. The communications range footprint of the spacecraft should also be shown.\n\nSome numeric data should describe the altitude of the spacecraft and, when in \nrange of a GS, the elevation and azimuth angles to the spacecraft. These quantities \nare also used to drive GS antennas. Figure\u00a016.1 shows such a display. Note that \nnumerics concerning spacecraft elevation and azimuth are not shown because the \nspacecraft is not in range of the GS.\u00a0The range entry indicates how far it is from the \nGS.\u00a0Converted to minutes, the spacecraft is 56.05\u00a0minutes away.\n\nThe next question the visitor may ask is: \u201cHow is the spacecraft doing?\u201d That is, \nwhat is the state of health of the spacecraft? Therefore, telemetry should be col-\nlected from the spacecraft, and the subset of TTM data relevant to spacecraft (and \npayload) health and status should be displayed (numerically and graphically). \nRelevant data includes: (1) temperatures at key points, (2) ON/OFF states of \n\n\n\n236\n\n hardware components, (3) voltages and currents of selected components, (4) space-\ncraft attitude and ADACS telemetry, (5) battery charge state for each string, (6) \nparameters that are close to anomalous condition and (7) payload-related quantities. \nTo enable the GS operator to quickly review the large amount of information rele-\nvant to state of health, graphic displays of these quantities should be used, and the \ndisplay should span several of the most recent orbits, rather than just the present \nvalues of the quantities.\n\nThe visitor\u2019s next question may be: \u201cWhen is the spacecraft going to be in com-\nmunication range with this and other ground stations?\u201d The table of contact access \ntimes shown in Fig. 3.3b, repeated here as Fig.\u00a016.2, answer this question. It should \nbe displayed at the GS.\n\nThe next question may be: \u201cWhat is the spacecraft going to do next?\u201d There \nshould be available from spacecraft telemetry a read-back of commands sent to the \nspacecraft earlier that answers this question.\n\nIn addition to these TTM displays, the GS must also command the spacecraft. \nFor this reason, there should be command generation dialog boxes from which the \nset of commands to the spacecraft could be assembled. A great many commands are \nneeded to operate a spacecraft and its payload, however, most are commanded \n\nSatellite ID Sat 1 GS Bos SC Posit SC Visibility No\nOrbit No 6598 Lat +38.92\u00b0 -16.57\u00b0 Elevation\u00b0\n\nDate 07/21/2016 Lon -77.23\u00b0 +69.42\u00b0 Azimuth\u00b0\ntime 14:37:28 Alt 26 m 568 km Range km 23,542.7\n\nFig. 16.1 Spacecraft position and range, elevation and azimuth to GS\n\n16 Ground Stations and\u00a0Ground Support Equipment\n\n\n\n237\n\n repetitiously. For this reason, the repetitious commands should be scripted to ease \nthe workload of the GS operator.\n\nCommands are generally of the form: What? When? and How? It is best if the \ncommands were assembled at the GS at a high level (rather than micro-managing \nthe spacecraft). Let the spacecraft convert the high-level command to the detailed \nactions that must occur to execute the command.\n\nFor example, the high-level command of: Transmit Message A at 11:05 at \n2.065\u00a0GHz is converted by the spacecraft as follows:\n\n 1. Power UP the transmitter in the standby mode at 11:043\n 2. Tune it to 2.065\u00a0GHz\n 3. Retrieve Message A from memory\n 4. Set the Power Level and Bit Rate\n 5. At 11:05 Key the transmitter and send the message\n\nNot so many years ago, spacecraft were not commanded in this way. Spacecraft \nused to be commanded, step by step, to implement each action that had to be under-\ntaken. With the advances in computer technology, it is no longer necessary to do so. \nThe spacecraft should be able to interpret high-level commands and detail these out \nautomatically on the spacecraft.\n\nAnomaly Resolution and the Safehold Mode When the spacecraft experiences an \nanomaly, the spacecraft or the GS should have scripted sets of commands to send \nup, while the spacecraft is still within line of sight, to resolve the anomalies, if pos-\nsible. Often the first step in the process of resolving anomalies is to put the space-\ncraft in the Safehold Mode. This is a mode that minimizes power consumption and \nonly operates the most needed spacecraft components so as to gain time to figure \nout what to do next. The spacecraft and the GS design should anticipate all kinds of \npossible failures and should have scripts ready to execute when one occurs. In many \ncases, the spacecraft can monitor the relevant points to determine if an anomaly has \noccurred and can invoke the scripted set of steps to correct, or work around, the \nanomaly without GS interaction. Then, the GS merely needs to be informed by the \nspacecraft what anomaly occurred and what the spacecraft did about it.\n\nAccess Start Time (UTCG) Stop Time (UTCG) Sec \n1 31 Aug 2016 04:26:44.649 31 Aug 2016 04:40:06.258 801.610\n2 31 Aug 2016 06:07:21.438 31 Aug 2016 06:18:33.846 672.408\n3 31 Aug 2016 18:34:18.880 31 Aug 2016 18:43:05.994 527.113\n4 31 Aug 2016 20:11:13.687 31 Aug 2016 20:24:34.033 800.346\n5 31 Aug 2016 21:52:18.323 31 Aug 2016 22:04:21.323 723.000\n6 31 Aug 2016 23:35:46.300 31 Aug 2016 23:44:24.396 518.095\n7 01 Sep 2016 01:18:11.672 01 Sep 2016 01:26:49.920 518.248\n8 01 Sep 2016 02:58:14.680 01 Sep 2016 03:10:17.845 723.165\n\nFig. 16.2 Spacecraft access times at a ground station\n\n16.1 Ground Stations\n\n\n\n238\n\n16.2  Ground Support Equipment\n\nGround Support Equipment, or GSE, consists of Mechanical Ground Support \nEquipment (MGSE) and Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE). Together, \nthese support the spacecraft on the ground and at the launch site.\n\nMGSE typically include mechanical fixtures to lift, turn and move the spacecraft \nin the laboratory, in transport or at the launch site.\n\nEGSE is in effect a paired down version of the ground station. With the EGSE \nconnected by an umbilical cable, the spacecraft can be operated as if it were in \nspace, with the exception that the GS antenna would not be used. In an ideal world, \nthe EGSE can operate with the spacecraft as hardware-in-the-loop, just as the \nDynamic Simulator in Chap. 14 could operate with the spacecraft ADACS as \nhardware-in-the-loop.\n\nTesting all functions of the spacecraft repeatedly in the laboratory while the \nspacecraft is in development or in test is the main function of the EGSE.\u00a0Since this \nis a time-consuming and repetitious function, the EGSE should be semi-automated \nso that it could act as Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), speeding up test and verifi-\ncation of satellite functions.\n\nThe cost and time required to develop good EGSE are usually underestimated. \nThis is not the place where one should try to save money. Once built, the EGSE can \nbe adapted to other spacecraft missions, enabling one to spread the cost of EGSE \nover several programs.\n\n16.3  Ground Station Manual and\u00a0Operator Training\n\nA Ground Station Manual for operating the spacecraft should be prepared. It should \ncontain:\n\n\u2022 Description of the spacecraft and how it operates\n\u2022 A list of all commands possible\n\u2022 A listing of all the telemetry that it sends to the ground\n\u2022 A keystroke by keystroke description of how to command the spacecraft\n\u2022 A description of the ground station hardware and software\n\u2022 A listing of anomalous conditions, how to recognize them, and what to do about \n\nthem\n\u2022 A description of how to archive TTM and CMD data\n\nAn Operator Training Manual/Course should be prepared. It should instruct the \nfuture ground station operators on all of the above capabilities contained in the \nGround Station Manual. The Operator Training Course should enable the future \noperators to gain hands-on experience. For this reason, the operator training course \nmay be given during the last stages of spacecraft checkout, so that the actual space-\ncraft and the EGSE simulation of the ground station are available.\n\n16 Ground Stations and\u00a0Ground Support Equipment\n\n\n\n239\n\nPreparation of a good Ground Station Manual and an Operator Training Course \nare not small matters. The time and effort required to prepare these should not be \nunderestimated.\n\n16.4  Other Ground Station Matters\n\nSpacecraft RF Acquisition and Tracking It is assumed that the spacecraft receiver \nis ON, but the transmitter is not when the spacecraft comes up over the horizon. \nBased on the satellite ephemeris, the ground station antenna can be slewed to the \nrequired direction. If the spacecraft and the ground station antennas are relatively \nlow-gain antennas, the spacecraft can be tracked by the ground station open loop, \nthat is, by only using the azimuth and elevation angles obtained from the spacecraft \norbital elements. If the ground station antenna gain is high, the antenna system must \nfirst search the uncertainty area in azimuth and elevation until the spacecraft is \nacquired and tracked (closed loop). For this to happen, the spacecraft transmitter \nmust be ON and transmitting something, typically telemetry.\n\nIn communicating with the spacecraft, the instantaneous doppler frequency \nshould be used to pre-doppler shift the ground station transmitter frequency in the \nopposite direction. Similarly, in receiving spacecraft communications, the ground \nstation receiver should be pre-doppler shifted to eliminate the time it would other-\nwise take for a doppler search.\n\nUse of Multiple Ground Stations A single ground station will have access to the \nspacecraft only 4\u20135 times a day. All the data it collects must be downloaded during \nthe few minutes of these access intervals. However, if the spacecraft is in a Polar or \nnear-polar orbit, use of high latitude automated ground stations can increase satel-\nlite access and the amount of data that can be downloaded per day. There are several \nsatellite systems that employ such ground stations. For US satellites, positioning \nsuch stations in Alaska is a way of increasing satellite throughput.\n\n16.4 Other Ground Station Matters\n\n\n\n241\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG.

In the following, we will describe methods of designing the ground \nstation(s) and of operating the satellite(s) to maximize automation and minimize \nmanpower requirements.\n\n17.1  Ground Station Functions for\u00a0Spacecraft/Payload \nOperation\n\nThe functions that must be performed in real-time operation of a spacecraft and \npayload from a ground station are listed below:\n\n\u2022 Mission Planning\u00a0- plan out what the spacecraft should do for the next period of \ntime\n\n\u2022 (Optionally) run a simulation of the mission plan on a satellite simulator\n\u2022 Downloading and updating the spacecraft orbital parameters\n\u2022 Scheduling\u00a0 - set up communications contact time instances (for the next few \n\ndays)\n\u2022 Review the spacecraft-ground station timeline of events\n\u2022 Prepare the Command Uploads\n\u2022 When in communication contact with the spacecraft, capture the telemetry \n\n(TTM) and data downloads\n\u2022 Review the TTM to ensure the spacecraft (and payload) health are OK\n\u2022 If there are anomalies, (1) resolve them, or (2) command the spacecraft into the \n\nSafe-Hold Mode\n\n\n\n242\n\n\u2022 Pass on the payload data to the payload customer\n\u2022 Review and archive TTM data.\n\u2022 Decide if anything different has to be done\n\nThe ground station hardware and software with which these functions are imple-\nmented is shown in the generic ground station block diagram, shown in Fig.\u00a017.1.\n\nThe GS has many different displays. The most important displays are: (1) a map \nshowing the spacecraft location, (2) TTM data alphanumeric and graphic displays, \nand (3) spacecraft command generation display.\n\nFig. 17.1 A generic ground station block diagram\n\n17.1.1  The Map and\u00a0Access Time Interval Display\n\nTo gain an understanding of what is going on, a ground trace of the satellite orbit over \nthe next few hours (or days) is required. The display shown in Fig.\u00a017.2 illustrates \npart of an orbit, the ground station location (Washington, DC), the present location \nof the satellite and elevation contours of 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. This display was generated \nby the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) of Analytical Graphics. Several other programs (such \nas NOVA of the Amateur Satellite Society) are also able to generate such displays.\n\nThe passes to use, on which to downlink telemetry and on which to send com-\nmands to the spacecraft, can be selected from this display. Typically, nighttime and \n\n17 Spacecraft Operations\n\n\n\n243\n\nlow elevation angle passes should be avoided. However, if the ground station(s) are \nautomated or are at a high latitude so that they can see the satellite more often, then \neach pass can be used for telemetry downlink and command uplink.\n\n17.1.2  Telemetry Monitoring\n\nThere is a tendency to want too much telemetry. Telemetry (except for that required \nto diagnose and correct anomalies) should give an overview of the spacecraft condi-\ntion over the last few orbits, and should alert the operator to anomalies or to \n\nAccess Start Time (UTCG) Stop Time (UTCG) Seconds \n1 31 Aug 2016 04:26:44.649 31 Aug 2016 04:40:06.258 801.610\n2 31 Aug 2016 06:07:21.438 31 Aug 2016 06:18:33.846 672.408\n3 31 Aug 2016 18:34:18.880 31 Aug 2016 18:43:05.994 527.113\n4 31 Aug 2016 20:11:13.687 31 Aug 2016 20:24:34.033 800.346\n5 31 Aug 2016 21:52:18.323 31 Aug 2016 22:04:21.323 723.000\n6 31 Aug 2016 23:35:46.300 31 Aug 2016 23:44:24.396 518.095\n7 01 Sep 2016 01:18:11.672 01 Sep 2016 01:26:49.920 518.248\n8 01 Sep 2016 02:58:14.680 01 Sep 2016 03:10:17.845 723.165\n\nFig. 17.2 Satellite location, communication footprints  \nand communication access times\n\n17.1 Ground Station Functions for\u00a0Spacecraft/Payload Operation\n\n\n\n244\n\napproaching anomalies. Sampling telemetry points every (say) 1\u00a0minute provides a \nplot of the behavior of each point with 90\u201396 samples per orbit. For a typical 100 \ntelemetry points in a LEO satellite, 18,000 samples are enough to plot two orbits of \nbehavior. If each sample is one Byte, the total telemetry downlink consists of 144 \nKbits. At a data rate of (say) 19.2\u00a0kbps, it takes about 7.5\u00a0seconds to downlink all of \nthe telemetry needed. For a specific 3-axis stabilized imaging satellite, described in \nSect. 2.2, the telemetry points are Fig.\u00a017.3:\n\nTelemetry Points Bits Telemetry Points Bits\nEPS Telescope/Camera\n2 Battery Temperatures 16 3 Telescope Temperatures 24\n2 Battery Volts and Amps 32 2 Camera Temperatures 16\n4 Solar Panel Currents 32 1 Camera Current, Voltage 16\n3 DC/DC Converter I and V 48 1 Image Processor Temp, I , V 24\n2 Battery Heater ON/OFF State 16 RF Subsystem\nADACS 1 Transmitter Power 16\n3 Reaction Wheel Amps, Volts 48 1 Enable Transmitter 8\n3 Reaction Wheel Speeds 48 1 Enable Receiver 8\n3 Reaction Wheel and Temps 24 1 Receiver Signal Strength 16\nADACS computer Temp, Amp 16 1 Transmitter, Rcvr Temps 16\nAttitude, orbit elem frm GPS 144 Xmitter, Rcver ON/OFF state 8\nStructure Propulsion\n8 Structure Temperatures 64 2 Tank Pressures, Temps 48\nSeparation Switch State 8 4 Thruster Temperatures 24\nDigital 4 Thruster ON/OFF states 24\n1 C&DH Temp, I and V 24 Miscellaneous 96\n\nTotal bits/sample 856\nNo of TTM bits. 180 samples 154,080\n\nFig. 17.3 Typical telemetry points and telemetry data in a LEO spacecraft\n\nTelemetry data can be displayed in tabular form or graphically as two orbit plots \nfor each telemetry point, organized in several graphs (EPS, ADACS, Propulsion, \netc.). The graphical display allows the operator to see at a glance if everything is \nokay without having to read the volumes of data.\n\nEach telemetry point is assigned limits within which the telemetry reading is \nnormal. Readings out of this range are potential anomalies that are brought to the \noperator\u2019s attention.\n\nIn addition to the Routine Telemetry described above, the spacecraft should be \nable to downlink more detailed Engineering Telemetry on request. For example, the \nspacecraft attitude vs. time during a maneuver is of interest during the spacecraft \non-orbit checkout phase. Propulsion thruster activity during a station-keeping \nmaneuver is another situation where more detailed telemetry is needed. The space-\ncraft should be able to provide such detailed telemetry. Commands to the spacecraft \nto collect and downlink such telemetry would specify (1) the point or points that \nshould be sampled, (2) the time interval over which samples should be taken and (3) \nthe sample rate that should be used.\n\n17 Spacecraft Operations\n\n\n\n245\n\n17.1.3  Spacecraft Command Generation\n\nEvery piece of hardware and each spacecraft (and payload) function should be com-\nmandable from the ground station. Command Generation should be implemented \nwith menus with default parameters corresponding to the usual values of the \ncommand.\n\nWith increasing automation, higher level commands or command sequences \nshould be prepared to make it easier to command the spacecraft. Higher level com-\nmands are generally of the form: What, When and How? For example, to command \nthe spacecraft to send TTM at a specific time should only require the ground station \nto command the spacecraft to: Send TTM at 09:35:35. The spacecraft should then \ninterpret this command and convert it to the sequence of actions needed to imple-\nment the command. These might be: Power up the transmitter into the Standby \nMode at 09:35:15. Transfer the TTM data from the C&DH computer to an output \nbuffer at 09:35:30. Key the transmitter and send the TTM data at 09:35:35. The \nmore scripted high level commands exist, the more human operator errors can be \navoided.\n\nWhen special telemetry is required to examine something in more detail, it \nshould be a grounds requested data set. The normal TTM data should not be clut-\ntered with matter normally not looked at.\n\n17.1.4  Anomaly Discovery and\u00a0Resolution\n\nAnomalous behavior can be discovered by looking at the TTM data. For example, if \nthe transmitter current is zero or low after the transmitter was commanded to power \nup, there is something wrong. Either the transmitter is not functioning correctly, or \nthe voltage and current monitors are not working. In either case, an anomaly \noccurred.\n\nMost anomalies can be discovered by observing the TTM.\u00a0For this reason, the \ndiscovery of an anomaly can be automated at the ground station. Since this can be \ndone from TTM alone, the spacecraft software could contain the same anomaly \ndetection logic so that it could Self-Discover an anomaly.\n\nA few years ago, one could not talk about automating anomaly discovery at the \nground station, no less in the spacecraft. Now, with the advances in the capabilities \nand speed of computers and microprocessors, the time is ripe for automating as \nmuch as possible. This can also help to reduce manloading at the ground station.\n\nTo resolve and correct anomalies, a list of possible anomalies and corrective \nactions should be prepared, and the ground station software should have a library of \ncorrective actions as a set of scripted commands ready to be uploaded.\n\nJust as in the case of automating anomaly discovery on the spacecraft, some \nanomaly resolution corrective actions can also be automated on the spacecraft.\n\nThe spacecraft should put into its downlinked telemetry what the anomaly was \nand how the spacecraft corrected it.\n\n17.1 Ground Station Functions for\u00a0Spacecraft/Payload Operation\n\n\n\n246\n\n17.1.5  Archiving TTM and\u00a0Data\n\nNot much needs to be said about this. It is pretty obvious that this should be done.\n\n17.2  Data and\u00a0Data Rate Limitations\n\nThe amount of data that can be collected from the spacecraft at the ground station is \nlimited, and the mission must be planned with these limitations in mind. While \ndownlinking telemetry only takes a few seconds, downlinking payload data may be \nanother matter.\n\nFor example, an imaging spacecraft taking 16 MP images with 24 bits/pixel col-\nlects 384Mbits per image. In a 6.4\u00a0minute pass at 1 Mbps, only 1 image can be \ndownlinked. Even if the transmitter power or antenna gain were increased to permit \ntransmitting at a higher bit rate, the number of images per pass that can be down-\nlinked is quite small. If JPG compression is used, it could reduce the number of bits \nper image by a factor of (say) 10. This would enable to downlink 10\u201340 images per \npass. This is much more acceptable. Since there are only about 4\u20135 passes per day \nat a ground station, 40\u2013160 images per day would be the limit of what a single \nground station could collect.\n\nIf there were additional ground stations (such as a high latitude automatic ground \nstation), there would be 15 passes a day on which image data could be captured. \nThis would increase the capability of the spacecraft system in that it could capture \n150\u2013600 images per day.\n\nAn alternative method of increasing the spacecraft system throughput is to use a \ngeostationary satellite relay. Theoretically, the number of pictures collected per day \ncould become very large. System throughput limitation would probably be trans-\nferred to the electric power system that may limit the amount of time the transmitter \ncan be ON, or how long other components participating in the image taking and \ntransmission process can be powered.\n\n17.3  Other Ground Station Operations\n\n17.3.1  Post Launch and\u00a0Checkout\n\nImmediately after launch of the spacecraft, the ground station must establish first \ncontact, receive and interpret first telemetry and upload an initial schedule. After \nthat, the spacecraft checkout process can start. This process consists of giving each \npossible command to the spacecraft and verifying that it correctly executed the \ncommand. This can be a very time-consuming process, as the ground station has \n\n17 Spacecraft Operations\n\n\n\n247\n\naccess to the spacecraft only a few times per day. For more complicated spacecraft, \nthis process can take several weeks.\n\nWhile it is not yet done much today, automation could be introduced into the on- \norbit checkout process. A very long string of spacecraft commands can be uploaded, \nand from telemetry, the performance of the satellite in response to these commands \ncan be assessed almost automatically, significantly reducing checkout time and \nreducing manning requirements.\n\n17.3.2  Test Plans and\u00a0Reports\n\nThere are a great many (on the order of 20) plans and documents required for the \ndevelopment and operation of a ground station. It is not enough that a spacecraft \nshould work well, the ground station must plan and execute spacecraft and payload \noperations according to preplanned scenarios and operations to achieve success. \nCompliance with data preparation and reporting requirements should not be taken \nlightly, as success can be jeopardized by lack of preparedness.\n\n17.3.3  Manning the\u00a0Ground Station\n\nYears ago, it took a whole army to operate a spacecraft. That is no longer the case. \nEven multiple spacecraft can be operated by a single person if everything goes well. \nHowever, if it does not, one needs to have rapid access to the engineers who designed \nthe spacecraft and wrote its software. The one full-time equivalent person can rap-\nidly grow to five or more.\n\n17.3.4  Cost of\u00a0Spacecraft Operations\n\nThe spacecraft has to be developed only once, and it is launched only once, but \nspacecraft operations last for many years. Therefore, the cost of manning ground \nstation operations is a key element of the total (or life cycle) cost of a spacecraft \nsystem.\n\nThe more automation is built into the spacecraft and the ground station, the \nsmaller the staffing and ground operations cost can become. The concept of auto-\nmating spacecraft operations is emerging as the trend for new ground station (and \nspacecraft) design.\n\n17.3 Other Ground Station Operations\n\n\n\n248\n\n17.3.5  Operator Training and\u00a0the\u00a0Spacecraft Simulator\n\nThe Operator Manual and the Training Aids ensure that ground operations run \nsmoothly and that the operators could do their job well.\n\nOften, particularly in developing a set of corrective actions in response to an \nanomaly, it is necessary that the corrective actions be tried out on a satellite simula-\ntor, rather than on the actual spacecraft. For this reason, a satellite simulator is usu-\nally constructed and placed at the ground station. The satellite simulator is a \u201cFlat \nSat,\u201d constructed from the engineering model hardware that may have been devel-\noped during the design and construction of the spacecraft.\n\n17.3.6  Mission Life Termination\n\nThere is an increasing amount of space debris. Thus, it is important, if possible, to \nterminate the spacecraft mission by disposing of the spacecraft. There are several \nways this can be done:\n\n\u2022 Controlled Reentry, keeping some fuel on board with which to lower the orbit \naltitude, even if only putting the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit that dips low \ninto the atmosphere. The word \u201ccontrolled\u201d usually means that the position on \nEarth (preferably at some remote place over the ocean) where the spacecraft \nreaches a low altitude of (say) 50\u00a0km is controlled.\n\n\u2022 Kick the spacecraft into a parking orbit where it is not doing any harm. This too \ntakes propulsion, but for a LEO spacecraft usually less.\n\n\u2022 Let it burn up. The melting or ablating temperature of materials in a spacecraft \nmake this a low cost solution; but one must be careful, for not everything in a \nspacecraft will melt during deorbit.\n\n17.3.7  Ground Station Development Schedule\n\nThe spacecraft design engineer likes to design the spacecraft. He or she usually \ndelays the start of the design of the ground station. Management must ensure that \nthis does not happen. A hastily developed ground station usually is also hastily con-\nceived. And it may not be as efficient as it could be, or as it needs to be.\n\n17 Spacecraft Operations\n\n\n\n249\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_18\n\nChapter 18\nLow Cost Design and\u00a0Development\n\nIn 1995, I wrote a chapter on the RADCAL spacecraft for Reducing Space Mission \nCost, a book in the Space Technology Series. The book was edited by James Wertz \nand Wiley Larson. In the chapter, I wrote a section on the practices used to come up \nwith a very capable and complex spacecraft at a very low cost. The schedule (from \ncontract award to launch) took one day less than one year. In reviewing that chapter \nnow, after having developed 34 spacecraft, I must say that each procedure for keep-\ning costs down described in that chapter is true today. For this reason, this chapter \nis largely taken from that 1995 book. It is just as true today as it was then.\n\n18.1  Approach to\u00a0Low Cost\n\nThere is no magic formula or trick to achieving low cost. The secret, if any, is to do \nwhat every good program manager has known how to do since the beginning of the \nspace age:\n\n\u2022 Assemble a capable, small team of people\n\u2022 Set a short schedule\n\u2022 Make major trade-offs and technical decisions rapidly and decisively\n\u2022 Practice judicious concurrency between fabrication and design\n\u2022 Do not procrastinate or analyze unnecessarily\n\u2022 Do not let anyone slow you down\n\u2022 The Program Manager should run the program in a project vs. a matrix \n\norganization\n\u2022 Maintain a harmonious relationship with the customer\n\nThe secret, if any, to producing a high-technology, quality product is to take bold \nand innovative approaches, but implement them ultra-conservatively, and test the \nfinished product exhaustively under realistic operational conditions.\n\n\n\n250\n\n18.2  The Contract Should Focuses on\u00a0Functional Rather \nthan\u00a0Technical Specifications\n\nThe contract document should be short and should focus on functional rather than \ntechnical specifications. This enables the design team to make major trade-offs to \nminimize cost while adhering to the contract. One can trade off characteristics of \none subsystem against another. This facilitates selecting an implementation that \nmeets cost goals. It permits \u201cdesign-to-price.\u201d Unduly detailed technical specifica-\ntions tie the hands of designers. This is one of the most leveraged factors responsible \nfor low cost.\n\nThe single disadvantage of loosely defined contractual requirements is that it is \neasy for the customer to say during the inevitable \u201crequirement creep\u201d that occurs \nthroughout the development process that the additional requirements are within \nscope. If it were not for the continuing ability to make system level tradeoffs, this \ncould lead to a cost overrun.\n\nThe key to having harmonious relations with the customer is to keep the cus-\ntomer informed of everything that is going on, anticipate any concerns or questions, \nmake sure that satisfactory answers exist to those possible questions, and run faster \nthan questions can be posed, so that the customer cannot slow you down.\n\n18.3  Experienced, Small Project Team\n\nOrganize as a project team. Do not use a matrix organization where the people \nworking on the program may not be under full control of the Program Manager. A \nprogram starts by assigning an experienced core project team. Each member of the \nteam is responsible for his or her subsystem from initial conception to the launch \npad. Do not have separate systems engineers, preliminary designers, engineers to \ndevelop the hardware, integration and test engineers and another team for the launch \ncampaign. Each of the team members should not only be a subsystem specialist but \nalso a systems engineer. Because of his or her experience of having taken other \nsatellites \u201cfrom cradle to grave,\u201d less experienced staff members can be assigned to \nthe experienced team leaders to learn. On the next program, the now-experienced \nteam member is assigned subsystem responsibility.\n\nThe small team is augmented by technicians, assembly, machine shop and other \nneeded functions on an \u201cas required\u201d basis. At any given time, there are typically \nthree times the number of people working on a program than the average number of \nFull-Time Equivalent people. This practice keeps costs down. Instead of assigning \na large full-time staff to the program, the average spending level is much lower. \nPeople are removed from the program and assigned elsewhere when no longer \nneeded.\n\n18 Low Cost Design and\u00a0Development\n\n\n\n251\n\n18.4  Vertical Integration\n\nBuild in-house as much as possible. This has two advantages. One is to lower the \ncost of components, while the other is improved availability. Since we do not have \nto make a living by building, for example, attitude control system components for \nsale, we do not have to support a whole company making these, and we do not have \nto maintain a full engineering, marketing, program management, and manufactur-\ning organization for each subsystem (as would a subsystem vendor). Thus, price can \nbe substantially lower for the same subsystem. The other advantage of vertical inte-\ngration is the ready availability of the component. If a component is needed in a \nhurry, expedite it in your own shops.\n\n18.5  Short Schedules and\u00a0Concurrency of\u00a0Development \nand\u00a0Manufacturing\n\nA short schedule is a blessing in disguise to keep costs low. One simply does not \nhave enough time to spend much money. It also forces practicing concurrency \nbetween engineering development and manufacturing.\n\nIn the customary development process, very senior engineers start the program \ndoing systems engineering and front end design. The same team then prepares for \nthe Preliminary Design Review, eliminates deficiencies identified during the review \nand then continues to detailed design and the Critical Design Review. Only then \ndoes development and fabrication begin in earnest. This is an expensive way of \ndoing business. By delaying start of fabrication until the design is completed, the \nheavy front-end design effort comes to an end, and the people who did it have little \nto do after Critical Design Review. So, they invent additional things to do, refine, \nstudy, or redesign. In any case, this effort costs money and stretches the schedule.\n\nOperate differently. First assess which subsystems or components will not \nchange during detailed design and release those to production right away. In this \nway, while the engineers complete the system design or the design of new compo-\nnents, already mature components are in fabrication and ready for checkout and \nsubsystem integration when an engineer becomes available from system design. \nKnowing that work is waiting whenever his or her front-end engineering is com-\npleted disincentives procrastination and eliminates prolonging unnecessary analy-\nses. Thus, much of the hardware may be completed by Critical Design Review \nwhile other parts of the system have not yet been designed.\n\nThis method of operation would not be possible if it were not for very experi-\nenced engineers who have, over several programs, developed a \u201cfeel\u201d for knowing \nwhen the risk of proceeding with fabrication is low, and when more analysis is \nneeded before it is prudent to proceed. Concurrency is not a four letter word if prac-\nticed by seasoned engineers.\n\n18.5 Short Schedules and\u00a0Concurrency of\u00a0Development and\u00a0Manufacturing\n\n\n\n252\n\nThe expenditure profile versus time of the program run in this way tends to be \nlinear; it does not exhibit the usual S-shape, resulting from a slow buildup, an accel-\nerating middle, and a phase-down toward the end. There are two reasons for this. \nOne is that more of the components are built in-house. So, instead of ordering com-\nponents that have to be paid for when they are delivered (giving rise to a deferral of \nexpenditures and the S-shape), components are built in-house, expending labor as \nsoon as a component is released to production. The second is the short schedule. \nThere is no time for buildup. We have to begin with a running start.\n\n18.6  Make Major Technical and\u00a0Cost Trade-Offs Rapidly \nand\u00a0Decisively\n\nThe Program Manager (or company management) should do a \u201ccost at completion\u201d \nestimate every 2 to 4\u00a0weeks and monitor cost performance personally. At the earliest \nsign of trouble (technical, cost or schedule), the Program Manager must immedi-\nately take the long view. Nearly all problems of cost and schedule are rooted in \ntechnical problems. In case of technical trouble, the manager must apply his or her \nbest judgment to assess how long it is going to take to solve the problem, how much \nit is going to cost, and then add 30% to his estimate. If the grand total is not within \nthe budget, alternative technical approaches must be rapidly brainstormed. These \ntechnical trade-offs must be made quickly, they must be sweeping in scope, and the \ndecision to continue or to change must be made decisively. Small changes do not \nresult in large savings.\n\n18.7  Production Coordinator to\u00a0Expedite Manufacturing\n\nThe key to low-cost manufacturing is the assignment of a production coordinator to \neach program. The production coordinator assures that the schedule is kept, that \nnothing falls through the cracks and that problems are solved to meet production \nschedule requirements. The production coordinator participates in engineering \nmeetings. He or she is thoroughly familiar with the product before it is built. He or \nshe expedites releasing engineering drawings, reminds people of their schedule \nobligations, makes sure that all the parts needed have been ordered, tracks the status \nof each subassembly and moves the work to the next process step. The production \ncoordinator participates in weekly program status reviews where he or she accounts \nfor each subsystem to the team leaders and identifies shortages and problems. This \ndisseminates information among project team members, solves problems on the \nspot and permits each member of the team to speak up if a proposed change would \nadversely affect him. The production coordinator is the key to meeting a tight manu-\nfacturing schedule.\n\n18 Low Cost Design and\u00a0Development\n\n\n\n253\n\n18.8  Do Not Try to\u00a0Save Money in\u00a0Testing\n\nIt is possible to hurry design and fabrication. It is foolish to hurry testing. Spend a \ngreat deal of time testing and exercising the system under simulated scenario condi-\ntions. It is only through use that problems become apparent that did not show up in \nnormal checkout. These tend to be mostly conceptual problems. It is only through \nrunning mission scenarios that it is discovered that \u201cas designed\u201d is not necessarily \n\u201cas intended.\u201d It often takes five months from the time the spacecraft is fully assem-\nbled with all subsystems checked out to the time it is ready to be shipped to the \nlaunch site.\n\n18.9  Holding Program Budget Responsibility Tightly\n\nBudget management practices and the views expressed here are nearly diametri-\ncally opposite to those of customary management teachings and practices. It is cus-\ntomary to divide the program into work packages and to assign to each major work \nbreakdown structure (WBS) element a cognizant manager, give each a schedule and \na budget, and then hold each responsible for both during the performance of the \nprogram. This traditional approach almost guarantees a cost overrun for two \nreasons:\n\n\u2022 Some of the work packages may have been underbid by mistake and their bud-\ngets will have to be increased. Assigning budgets and cognizance for each work \npackage ties the hands of the Program Manager; it is difficult for him or her to \nreduce the budget of a work package manager who has been doing a good job to \naugment another who is underfunded.\n\n\u2022 Typically, only a small percentage of work package managers are good money \nmanagers. Those who are not will overrun their budgets, some very badly. Those \nwho are good will bring in their tasks within budgets, but not much under budget. \nThe net result is that the overall program will overrun.\n\nBy contrast, the Program Manager should keep the entire budget to him or her-\nself. The program manager allocates this budget and a reserve between the work \npackages, but does not tell subsystem managers what the budgets are. If, while \ndiscussing the technical approach, schedule and cost of a work package with its \nteam leader, the cost estimate is higher than anticipated, the team leader is asked to \nthink of other ways of doing that task. This is done iteratively until the budgetary \ngoal is reached or the Program Manager is convinced that the budget must be \nincreased. If the estimate comes in lower than planned, then after assuring that it is \nvalid, the estimate is accepted, adding to the management reserve.\n\nIn this way, the work package managers can perform their individual tasks \naccording to their own approach, while the Program Manger can build up a manage-\nment reserve that will invariably be needed later. The management reserve must be \n\n18.9 Holding Program Budget Responsibility Tightly\n\n\n\n254\n\nlarge. Norm Augustine has said (based on some actual data) that \u201ca program man-\nager always underestimates his \u2018cost-to-complete\u2019 by 30%.\u201d He was correct.\n\n18.10  Conclusion\n\nThere is no magic or technology advance needed to make dramatic reductions in the \ncost of any spacecraft. Tight management, small project core teams, short sched-\nules, opportunity to make large cost-technical trade-offs and concurrency between \nengineering and production are the keys to low cost. The keys to a quality high \ntechnology product are making bold technical decisions, implementing them ultra- \nconservatively and subjecting the finished product to extensive testing.\n\n18 Low Cost Design and\u00a0Development\n\n\n\n255\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_19\n\nChapter 19\nSystems Engineering and\u00a0Program \nManagement\n\n19.1  Introduction\n\nThe Program Manager has the responsibility to deliver a spacecraft that meets cus-\ntomer functional requirements and specifications, and is constructed within avail-\nable funds and within a specified schedule. He or she also ensures that the spacecraft \nmeet launch vehicle and ground station interface requirements, and that the space-\ncraft, when on orbit, can perform the specified mission.\n\nSystems Engineering starts with the customer functional specifications of the \nspacecraft and ground systems, flows these down to spacecraft subsystem and com-\nponent specifications to develop a spacecraft design that meets customer specifica-\ntions, mission requirements and cost targets, and can be developed and built within \nthe specified schedule. Systems Engineering also performs the tradeoff analyses \namong alternative implementations to determine the technical approach that best \nfits program and customer needs. It also performs sustaining and supporting analy-\nses during the development program. Systems Engineering maintains documenta-\ntion of the hardware, software, test plans and test results.\n\nIn the following, the above functions are described in more detail in the context \nof designing and building an imaging spacecraft system, like the one described in \nSect. 2.3.\n\n19.2  Top Level Requirements\n\nTop level systems requirements are usually specified by the customer. They should \nstate functional rather than technical requirements so as to permit the design team \nthe widest possible tradeoff space. For example, for an imaging spacecraft system \nconsisting of, perhaps, multiple satellites, the top level requirements should state the \ngeographical areas the system should cover, the resolution (GSD) requirements, the \n\n\n\n256\n\nrevisit time, the spacecraft system agility, the number of pictures per unit time or \nangular separation that the system should provide, the size or coverage of each pic-\nture, the distance between satellites and the time of day the spacecraft should be \nover specified areas.\n\nTop level specifications should not get into any more technical detail than neces-\nsary. However, which top level requirements are firm and which can be relaxed and \n\u201cnegotiated\u201d with the customer should be identified. This is particularly important \nif the spacecraft will be a secondary payload of some launch vehicle, because the \nprecise orbit inclination, altitude and eccentricity will be controlled by the Primary \nPayload.\n\n19.3  Requirements Flowdown\n\nFrom the top level requirements, Systems Engineering should develop orbit and \nsubsystem technical requirements. This is the flowdown process from which a set of \nspacecraft technical specifications is obtained.\n\nFor example, from the top level requirement of the size and resolution of the \nimages the satellite should transmit to the ground, the number of pixels per image \ncan be computed. From the number of images per pass over areas of interest, the \ndownlink bit rate can be obtained. Then, computing the RF link equation for the \nspecified ground station antenna size, the satellite transmitted EIRP (sum of trans-\nmitter power and spacecraft antenna gain) can be obtained for any specified fre-\nquency band. If a reasonable transmitter power and low gain antenna can close the \nlink, the transmitter power and downlink bit rate are readily specified. If, on the \nother hand, the required EIRP is very large, a high gain spacecraft antenna and/or \nhigh transmitter power may be required. This introduces additional complexities of \n(a) developing mechanisms for spacecraft antenna pointing and slewing, (b) using \nmore sophisticated modulation and forward error correction (FEC) methods that \nrequire lower received signal-to-noise ratios for the same bit error rate, BER, (c) \non-board storage of digitized images for later transmission to the ground or (d) use \nof a geostationary relay satellite to lengthen the time available to downlink images.\n\nAnother example of flowdown of top level requirements to subsystem specifica-\ntions would be the propulsion subsystem technical requirements derived from the \ndesired distance between satellites, the rapidity with which satellites have to be \nmoved and the station keeping operations the propulsion system must perform. It is \nhere that some \u201cnegotiation\u201d with the customer on top level requirements may be \nneeded. As shown in Chap. 11, moving the spacecraft rapidly to put it on station \nwithin a few hours of launch requires a great deal of fuel, while reducing the require-\nment to a few days, substantially reduces the amount of fuel needed, reduces the \nsize of the required fuel tanks, reduces weight, and it simplifies the method of \nmounting the fuel tanks in the spacecraft. Since the size, weight and cost of the \nspacecraft can be affected in a major way by the required speed of satellite \n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n257\n\n deployment, the above arguments would deal the spacecraft Program Manager a \nstrong hand in negotiating with the customer.\n\n19.4  Multiple Approaches\n\nThere are often multiple approaches in flowing down top level requirements to sub-\nsystem specifications. The above example of how to obtain the required EIRP is an \ninstant in point. It can be achieved by (a) a high power transmitter and a low gain \nantenna or by (b) using a lower power transmitter and a higher gain antenna. The \nformer simplifies the antenna system, and reduces pointing accuracy requirements. \nOn the other hand, it increases electric power requirements (leading to larger solar \narrays and larger DC/DC converter power handling capabilities).\n\nWithin the electric power subsystem, the electric power could be distributed \nfrom a single DC/DC converter for each required component voltage (with separate \nswitches at the inputs of the components for turning it ON or OFF), or separate DC/\nDC converters could be used to power each component independently, turning ON/\nOFF each separate converter as its use is required. The latter distributed system \nreduces the power handling requirement of each converter, and it provides an addi-\ntional measure of overall system reliability. On the other hand, it may increase sys-\ntem complexity and weight.\n\nTo achieve a given GSD, the spacecraft may be flown at a higher altitude to pro-\nlong satellite lifetime, driving up the required telescope aperture size. Alternatively, \na lower orbit altitude may permit use of a less expensive telescope, but may require \na small propulsion system for drag makeup. Since a propulsion system is required \nfor putting the satellite on station and for station keeping, the additional fuel required \nfor drag makeup may be acceptable. Flying higher with a larger aperture telescope \nmay be much more expensive than the cost of additional fuel for drag makeup.\n\nMultiple approaches to satisfying the mission and functional requirements of the \nspacecraft may exist in many subsystems. For this reason, the requirement flow-\ndown process may require doing a number of tradeoff studies.\n\n19.5  Trade Studies\n\nThe trade studies should identify multiple approaches to the design of the space-\ncraft, and should compare the technical risk, cost, schedule and performance risk or \nreliability of these approaches. These are the objectives of the trade studies. The \ntrade studies should be performed as rapidly as possible, for completing these stud-\nies holds up the design of the spacecraft, and impacts cost and schedule.\n\n19.5 Trade Studies\n\n\n\n258\n\n19.6  Selection of\u00a0a\u00a0Point Design\n\nSince the design of the spacecraft cannot be fixed or frozen until the trade studies \nare completed, it is important to only perform the most important tradeoffs first, the \noutcome or conclusions of which have the largest impact on the satellite design and \nmission performance capabilities, as well as the cost and schedule.\n\nOther less important trade studies can be performed concurrently with the space-\ncraft detailed design process.\n\nOnce the selection process is completed from the results of the tradeoff studies, \nthe satellite baseline design can be finalized, and the technical specifications of each \nsubsystem can be developed.\n\nIn the selection of the point design, the experience of the Program Manager and \nthe design team is critical in choosing a robust and simple design that can be imple-\nmented within budget and schedule.\n\n19.7  Concept of\u00a0Operations\n\nThe Concept of Operations is a document that describes how the spacecraft-ground \nstation system will operate from launch to the end of the mission. It describes the \nway the system will be commanded to perform each of the system functions, and \nhow the mission will be performed. It describes in detail a \u201ctypical day\u201d in the life \nof the system. It is perhaps one of the most important initial outputs of Systems \nEngineering, because from it, potential conceptual system problems can be identi-\nfied and corrected.\n\nAs the system design matures, the Concept of Operations should be updated \nperiodically.\n\n19.8  Preliminary Design Review (PDR)\n\nWhen the spacecraft design reaches a point where the preliminary design is com-\npleted and most of the important tradeoffs have been made, a Preliminary Design \nReview (PDR) is scheduled with the customer. In this design review, the design \nteam describes how subsystem specifications were derived from top level require-\nments, and how each subsystem will be designed to meet subsystem specifications. \nShort of the actual design of the hardware and software, the PDR fully describes the \nspacecraft. It also shows how the Concept of Operations is implemented by the \nspacecraft.\n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n259\n\n19.9  Interface Control Documents (ICDs)\n\nInterface Control Documents define the mechanical, electrical, signal and commu-\nnication protocol interfaces between subsystems. They are essential documents \nwhen designing a spacecraft with a large number of people or with many subcon-\ntractors responsible for different subsystems.\n\nEach ICD is like a contract between subsystems or subcontractors, where each \ncan work on its own as long as they satisfy the pertinent ICDs.\n\nSatisfying the requirements of an ICD also exhibits technical, cost or other dif-\nficulties that designers of a subsystem encounter. This may require renegotiating the \nICD between subsystems to permit realizing a working and cost-effective design \nwithin budget. The function of the Program Manager is to officiate over these ICD \nnegotiations, if they are required, since they usually involve changes to the budget \nor schedule.\n\n19.10  Detail Design\n\nAfter the PDR identified the technical approaches and the basic design of the space-\ncraft, its detail design can start. In some instances, where the subsystem design is \nmature, construction may also commence.\n\nAs the design progresses, the cost-to-complete and the schedule are monitored \nand actions are taken and decisions are made to assure that total project costs remain \nwithin budget. This is a difficult task for cost estimating is an imprecise process, and \nit depends to a large extent on the proficiency of the design team.\n\n19.11  Critical Design Review (CDR)\n\nWhen the detail design of the spacecraft is completed, a Critical Design Review \n(CDR) is scheduled. The CDR, like the PDR, describes the design of the satellite \nand all of its subsystems, and provides the detailed backup of how or why specific \ntechnical approaches were selected.\n\nThe CDR generates the final design baseline of the satellite, describing what will \nbe built. It is the most important document that defines the design.\n\nOn some large projects, it is also the point in time when the build process begins. \nHowever, as pointed out earlier, a prudent measure of concurrency between design \nand fabrication can significantly reduce schedule and cost.\n\n19.11 Critical Design Review (CDR)\n\n\n\n260\n\n19.12  System and\u00a0Mission Simulations\n\nWhile not mandatory, a simulation of system performance during the detail design \nprocess can identify problems or increase confidence in the design. For this reason, \na software simulation environment of the system, converted later into a \u201chardware- \nin- the-loop\u201d simulation tool, is often created. This simulation is used to exercise the \nsystem in different scenarios, and to observe system performance during the mis-\nsion. System simulation is an important tool for ensuring that the final system can \nperform to the mission requirements.\n\n19.13  Test Bed and\u00a0\u201cFlatsat\u201d\n\nDevelopment of the spacecraft is facilitated by the use of hardware test beds in which \nindividual subsystems can be tested and subjected to realistic flight conditions.\n\nFor example, the electric power test bed, with programmable power supplies, \ngenerates all solar panel output currents as a function of time. These are then sup-\nplied to the spacecraft electric power subsystem hardware where the batteries, \ncharge regulators, DC/DC converters, power switches and the EPS telemetry collec-\ntion subsystem are exercised and are used to power the spacecraft components. The \ncomponents are simulated by electric loads that match the power consumption of \nthe actual spacecraft components.\n\nThe test bed for the entire spacecraft, the Flatsat, is ultimately populated with \nactual (or duplicate) spacecraft hardware to convert the Flatsat to a hardware-in- \nthe-loop simulation system.\n\n19.14  Statement of\u00a0Work\n\nThe Statement Of Work (SOW) describes in detail how the spacecraft system is \ngoing to be designed, built and tested, and it describes each specific activity the \ndesign and build team will undertake. To make it easier to describe and perform the \nStatement Of Work, the work is divided into work packages in a Work Breakdown \nStructure (WBS). The WBS is the collection of each of these specific tasks. Below, \na WBS for the imaging spacecraft is described.\n\n19.15  The Work Breakdown Structure\n\nThe WBS contains work packages related to the Launch vehicle, Integration with \nthe Launch Vehicle, Launch Site Activities, etc. Here the part of the WBS related to \nthe building of the spacecraft is detailed. In this example, the WBS is carried to \nthree levels.\n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n261\n\n 1.0 The Spacecraft\n 1.0.1 Program Management\u00a0\u2013 Overall cognizance of the program, its technical, \n\ncost and schedule performance over the life of the program is controlled \nand monitored by the Program Manager. The Program Manager is also the \nmain interface between the customer and the program.\n\n 1.0.2 Systems Engineering\u00a0 \u2013 In this task, customer requirements are flowed \ndown to subsystem technical specifications. Technical, cost and schedule \ntradeoffs are carried out, and from these, the point design that meets the \ntechnical, cost and schedule requirements of the program is selected. \nContinuing analyses are performed during the design and build phase to \nsupport hardware and software development. Systems Engineering also \nmaintains a record of the spacecraft design, and updates this data base \nfrequently.\n\n 1.1.0 Structure\n 1.1.1 Structure Design\u00a0\u2013 Design the spacecraft structure to accommodate space-\n\ncraft electronic components, deployable solar arrays, star tracker(s) (with \nclear Fields of View to the star field), a propulsion system with multiple \nthrusters, all required antennas (with assurance that the structure should not \ninterfere with the antenna patters), and the telescope. Coordinate with the \nthermal design to ensure that the telescope temperature range should be \nsmall enough to keep the telescope in focus. Provide autofocus capabilities \nif the telescope temperature range is predicted to exceed the focus limits. \nPlan to use a Lightband separation system. Lay out the electronic compo-\nnents of the satellite to keep the CG within 0.25? of the axial center of the \nsatellite (a Launch Vehicle requirement), and the CG-CP distance to be \nminimum (to keep atmospheric drag from tipping the spacecraft in flight). \nMaintain a weight statement of the spacecraft. Develop CAD drawings of \nthe structure.\n\n 1.1.2 Structural Analysis\u00a0\u2013 Develop a Finite Element Model of the structure and \nanalyze it to determine resonant frequencies, margins, mass properties, CP \nand CG offset of the deployed spacecraft as propulsion fuel is used up. \nSpecial emphasis should be placed on mounting the telescope to minimize \nvibrational loads. Iterate the design until a satisfactory solution of low \nweight is obtained. Provide a NASTRAN file to the launch vehicle contrac-\ntor for coupled loads analysis. Continue to support the program during the \ndevelopment phase with analyses, as required.\n\n 1.1.3 Structure Fabrication\u00a0\u2013 Prepare the drawings from which the structure is \nto be built, send these to the machine shop and monitor fabrication. Once \ncompleted, assemble the structure and verify its weight. In the assembly, \nuse Mass Mockups in place of electronic components not yet available.\n\n 1.1.4 Mass Mockup Fabrication\u00a0\u2013 Design and fabricate the Mass Mockups, and \nensure that their mechanical properties agree with the mechanical parts of \nthe component ICDs (weight, CG location, resonant frequencies).\n\n 1.1.5 Structure Testing\u00a0 \u2013 Develop Static Loads and Vibration Test Plans and \nsupport the tests. Perform the tests and analyze the test results by compar-\n\n19.15 The Work Breakdown Structure\n\n\n\n262\n\ning them with predicted the performance. Adjust the structure model to \nensure that the model and test results agree.\n\n 1.2.0 Telescope & Camera\n 1.2.1 Determine the Optical System Technical Requirements\u00a0\u2013 Determine the \n\nsize of the required telescope aperture for the specified GSD and orbit alti-\ntude. Design the telescope as a folded optical system with a Modulation \nTransfer Function sufficiently large to achieve the required GSD every-\nwhere in the Field Of View of the optical system. Perform the telescope \nmechanical design so that it should survive launch vehicle vibrations as \nrepresented by the Launch Vehicle supplied spectrum. Also, by proper use \nof zero temperature coefficient materials, design the telescope mechanical \nstructure to ensure that its focal length should remain fixed over the expected \ntemperature range. The mechanical design of the telescope should also \nblock stray light and out of FOV light interference. If required, design an \naperture door to block solar heat from the telescope, and a door closing \nmechanism to shut the aperture door when the telescope is in direct sun \nincidence. Perform a radiometric analysis to determine the minimum expo-\nsure times for satisfactory images and to determine the interval in a day \nwhen the telescope will receive sufficient light intensity to generate a useful \nimage. Select the camera to provide sufficient sensitivity and small enough \npixel size to support GSD requirements and minimum exposure times. The \nmechanism for mating the camera to the telescope should also be designed. \nProvide in the design space for a motorized focusing mechanism to permit \nincreasing the temperature dynamic range over which the telescope-camera \ncombination will remain in focus. Work with the telescope subcontractor to \naccomplish the above objectives.\n\n 1.2.2 Procure the Telescope\u00a0\u2013 Place the telescope on contract, monitor the con-\ntract, support a PDR, CDR, and monitor the telescope and camera manufac-\nturing and testing process.\n\n 1.2.3 Camera\u00a0\u2013 Review available cameras and select one with short exposure \ntime, small pixel size and high sensitivity. Ensure that the camera could be \neasily mated to the telescope. Procure two copies of the camera, one for in- \nhouse use, the other for integration with the telescope. Thus the image cap-\nture and processing digital hardware can be tested and exercised with the \nin-house camera while the telescope is being built.\n\n 1.2.4 Image Capture & Processing Electronics\u00a0 \u2013 Design, build and test the \nimage processing subsystem. It should capture the images from the camera, \nshould JPG encode images to reduce their file size, encrypt each and append \neach with the time instant when the image was taken and with the spacecraft \nposition and attitude at the instant of image capture. This permits subse-\nquent calculation of image locations on the Earth. The image capture and \nprocessing electronics might be a separate digital processor, or its functions \nmight be included in the C&DH computer. The design of the digital image \nprocessor should include Forward Error Correction and the communication \nprotocol. In this way the output data stream is directly suitable for transmis-\n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n263\n\nsion by the spacecraft downlink transmitter. The image processor should \naccept imaging commands from the C&DH.\n\n 1.2.5 Telescope/Camera EGSE\u00a0\u2013 Design, construct and test hardware and soft-\nware to test the spacecraft imaging payload (Telescope-Camera). This \nEGSE may include a collimator to produce calibrated target images for the \ntelescope to image in a laboratory environment, and hardware to vary the \nlight intensity and contrast of the targets to simulate actual conditions.\n\n 1.3.0 C&DH\n 1.3.1 C&DH Hardware\u00a0\u2013 Select the C&DH hardware to provide the required \n\nspeed, word size, number of input and output ports, memory size, radiation \nhardness and software operating system to meet mission requirements. The \nhardware should be within the cost budget allocated for this subsystem. \nDetermine if the candidate C&DH has sufficient reliability, SEU sensitivity \nand redundancy to meet the multi-year mission requirements at the operat-\ning altitude. Ensure that its power consumption is within the power alloca-\ntion for the C&DH in the PDR.\u00a0The mechanical design or enclosure of the \nhardware should provide some radiation protection. If not built in-house, \nprocure the hardware and monitor progress of its development and fabrica-\ntion at the subcontractor.\n\n 1.3.2 C&DH Software Development\u00a0\u2013 Develop the C&DH software specifica-\ntions, and generate from these software module descriptions and equations. \nCode the software modules, test the code, and assemble the modules into \nthe C&DH software to test it with simulated inputs at the C&DH and other \ncomponent interfaces. As part of testing, introduce anomalies to test the \nability to recover from these. Document the software and maintain and \nupdate the software configuration. Since the C&DH software development \ntask is very large, it is usually broken down into many smaller subtasks.\n\n 1.4 ADACS\n 1.4.1 ADACS Design and Analyses\u00a0 \u2013 Develop an initial ADACS subsystem \n\nspecification, a flowdown from the top level system requirements. Conduct \ntradeoff analyses to compare the performance of several ADACS alterna-\ntives. Compare three-axis stabilization systems in which the actuators are \nthree reaction wheels with others where the actuators are control moment \ngyros. For attitude sensing the tradeoff studies should compare system per-\nformance using a single or two star trackers. The use of an inertial measur-\ning unit (IMU) to track spacecraft attitude during maneuvers should be \nstudied. Based on the results of the tradeoff analyses, select a baseline \nADACS configuration that meets the technical cost, weigh, power \n consumption and schedule requirements of the program. A key output of \nthe tradeoffs is the size of the reaction wheels, driven usually by spacecraft \nagility requirements. Since agility is a major cost driver, it is important to \nminimize reaction wheel torque and momentum requirements. Since the \nspacecraft will have a propulsion system for station keeping and for getting \non station rapidly, The requirements of propulsion activities on the ADACS \nmust be examined. The tradeoff studies have to compare the performance of \n\n19.15 The Work Breakdown Structure\n\n\n\n264\n\nthe spacecraft Determine attitude knowledge and control accuracies of KE \nBlock II during imaging, propulsion activity and during other operations \nincluding rapidly slewing between different off-nadir targets. Determine \nthe sensor and actuator suites required to achieve these accuracies. Simulate \nthe SC under various maneuvers to determine what the actual performance \nof the sensor and actuator suit is going to be during typical SC missions. \nUpgrade the present Proprietary MAI Dynamic Simulator to enable per-\nforming the required simulations. Continue to support the development pro-\ngram with such other AD ACS analyses as required.\n\n 1.4.2 Procure or Build the ADACS Hardware.\n 1.4.2.1 Procure a 3-Axis Magnetometer\u00a0\u2013 Specify and purchase a 3-axis magne-\n\ntometer and perform experiments to determine how far the magnetometer \nhas to be from the components of the spacecraft that generate magnetic \nfields (ADACS torque coils, motors, etc.). Modify the spacecraft mechani-\ncal design, if required, to ensure that magnetometer is positioned so that \nmagnetic readings should not be affected by spacecraft activities. In addi-\ntion, devise ways of operating the magnetometer when spacecraft magnetic \nactivities are low or zero (like in between torque coil activities).\n\n 1.4.2.2 Procure Torque Rods or Coils\u00a0\u2013 Conduct a tradeoff analysis to determine \nif torque coils or rods should be used, and to determine the magnetic \nmoment that they should produce. If the spacecraft is large enough, often \ntorque coils provide lighter actuators, and a magnetic field without hyster-\nesis. Torque coils or rods should be operated intermittently in a bang-bang \nmanner. This simplifies the torque coil driver, and it provides for periods \nwhen the torque coils or rods produce no magnetic field, making these peri-\nods available for magnetometer readings. After a decision is made and \ntorquer specifications are generated, the torque coils or rods should be \nprocured.\n\n 1.4.2.3 Procure the Reaction Wheels or CMGs\u00a0\u2013 Having specified the reaction \nwheels or CMGs, procure them, and monitor performance of the subcon-\ntractor. Since the Reaction Wheels or CMGs are usually long lead items, it \nis important to commit to a purchase early in the program. Usually CMGs \nare selected to increase the control authority of the ADACS system for rapid \nslewing. Reaction wheels are selected if lower power consumption and \nlarger momentum storage is required. Since there are relatively few compa-\nnies making CMGs compared to the number who make reaction wheels, \nlack of timely availability of the selected actuators may require changing, \nand staying with the more readily available reaction wheels. A decision \nbased on these considerations is made, and the reaction wheels or control \nmoment gyros are built or procured.\n\n 1.4.2.4 Sun Senor System\u00a0\u2013 The sun sensor system (its sensors, electronics and \nsoftware) provide a coarse measure of the sun vector direction in SC coor-\ndinates during the sunlight portion of the orbit. The type of sun sensor ele-\nments and the placement of its components on the spacecraft must be \ndetermined. A mockup should be constructed, the sensor system and its \n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n265\n\nsoftware should be fabricated and evaluated in the laboratory. The flight \nhardware should also be built and procured.\n\n 1.4.2.5 Inertial Measurement Unit\u00a0\u2013 An IMU will be used to measure in real time \nspacecraft attitude variations. This estimate will be used in the ADACS dur-\ning maneuvering, but will also be needed in the propulsion system which \nmust accomplish long duration thrusts to accelerate the spacecraft in a spec-\nified direction. During thrusting, the misalignment of the thrust vector from \nthe spacecraft CG will cause tumbling or drifting in the wrong direction. \nThe IMU will provide a continuous measure of spacecraft attitude to sense \nthe attitude error during thrusting. This information will provide the basis \nfor an algorithm to adjust the burn durations of the different thrusters to \ncause the net thrust to be through the CG and to thus eliminate tumbling or \ndrifting in the wrong direction. The IMU will be procured and electronics \nand software to interface it with the ADACS and/or the propulsion system \nwill be constructed.\n\n 1.4.2.6 Star Tracker(s)\u00a0\u2013 One or two star trackers are required to achieve the atti-\ntude knowledge accuracy required day and night. An analysis has to be \nperformed to determine the number and orientation of the star trackers on \nthe spacecraft, the directions to which they must point (in spacecraft coor-\ndinates) and the dependence of star tracker pointing, depending on the orbit \nin which the spacecraft will fly. Baffles may be needed to shield the star \ntrackers from direct sun or moon incidence. Star Tracker locations and \ndirections will be adjusted in accordance with baffle dimensions. The star \ntrackers will be procured.\n\n 1.4.3 ADACS EGSE\u00a0\u2013 A critical tool for evaluating and testing overall ADACS \nperformance is the ADACS Electronic Ground Support Equipment. The \nDynamic Simulator, described in Chap. 9, is a key component of this \nEGSE.\u00a0It simulates the space environment, provides signals to the space-\ncraft attitude sensors, flies the spacecraft in position and attitude in accor-\ndance with the orbit propagator and the activities of the spacecraft actuators. \nAn ADACS EGSE should be built. It could be combined with the propul-\nsion system EGSE.\n\n 1.4.4 Assemble, Integrate and Test ADACS\u00a0\u2013 Assemble the ADACS subsystem \nfrom its components. After assembly, test the system in accordance with the \nADACS Test Plan using the Dynamic Simulator to fly the spacecraft. \nSeparately test the star tracker in outdoors on clear nights.\n\n 1.4.5 ADACS Software, Validation and Verification\u00a0 \u2013 Develop the ADACS \nsoftware and test it in a hardware-in-the-loop configuration, including the \nspacecraft and the ADACS EGSE.\u00a0After each of the software and hardware \nmodules perform their respective functions correctly, from time-to-time \nsoftware verification will be run. This is a shortened scenario in which most \nof the spacecraft capabilities are exercised. Telemetry data is collected and \ncompared with the data that should exist if everything worked as designed. \nThe comparison is automated, and the Verification test results in a Pass-No \nPass score.\n\n19.15 The Work Breakdown Structure\n\n\n\n266\n\n 1.5.0 RF Communications\n 1.5.1 RF Analyses\u00a0\u2013 In addition to the LOS (light-of-sight) communication of \n\ntelemetry, TTM and Imagery and LOS communication of spacecraft com-\nmands, CMDs in the assigned frequency bands, consider the alternative (or \nadditional) use of a geostationary satellite relay for spacecraft communica-\ntions to enable continuous communications between spacecraft and Ground \nto increase satellite throughput. This communication, most likely through \nInmarsat, is at L-Band. Determine the required spacecraft antenna gain, \ntransmitter power and spacecraft antenna elevation and azimuth steering \nrequirements. Consider alternative spacecraft antennas (phased arrays or \nmechanically steerable antennas). Determine the impact of the different \nantennas on topside real-estate, power consumption, and on spacecraft atti-\ntude control, the need to deploy and steer the antenna, the cost and schedule \nto select the most cost-effective antenna configuration. Perform the prelimi-\nnary design of the antenna configuration. Analyze the link margins for the \nmost likely size of the Ground Station antenna, with a view toward opera-\ntions with mobile antennas. Choose the modulation type (FSK, BPSK, \nQPSK, O-QPSK, etc.) best suited to the achievement of a robust link that is \ncompatible with existing ground station capabilities. The legacy FSK mod-\nulation has many operational and hardware advantages. However, it is not \nthe most optimum modulation type.\n\n 1.5.2 Image Transmitter\u00a0\u2013 The RF transmitter on the spacecraft used to transmit \nthe high data rate imagery data may or may not be the same as the one used \nto transmit the low data rate telemetry data. For image transmission usually \na high power transmitter at a very high frequency is selected, as compared \nwith the telemetry transmission requirement that can be satisfied with low \npower lower frequency transmitters with Earth coverage antennas. The \nchoice of spacecraft transmitter and antenna combination must adhere to \nthe FCC requirement of maximum ground illumination density. This usu-\nally means that the maximum spacecraft transmitter power will be in the \n10\u201320\u00a0W range. The communication link calculations in Chap. 5 indicate \nthat a 10\u201320\u00a0W transmitter will suffice. The transmitter frequency, depend-\ning on compatibility requirements with the ground station, is likely to be \nbetween S-Band and X-Band, although the trend is for even higher micro-\nwave frequencies to capitalize on the larger bandwidth available. However, \nif we use a commercial Geostationary Relay satellite, the uplink frequency \nmost likely will have to be changed to L-Band. Therefore a new Image \nTransmitter must be selected. Since having redundant transmitters is an \nimportant aspect of reliability, consideration should be given to using a sec-\nond transmitter for telemetry. Select the most cost-effective solution and \nprocure the transmitter. Monitor its development frequently.\n\n 1.5.3 Telemetry Transmitter\u00a0\u2013 The above discussion covers this subject also. \nPurchase the TTM transmitter.\n\n 1.5.4 Command Receiver\u00a0\u2013 The command receiver, usually operating at a lower \nfrequency and low data rate, can be a SDR (Software Defined Radio) or a \n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n267\n\nlegacy radio receiver. It should include the decryption capability required to \nreceive and decode encrypted commands; however, it should be possible to \nbypass encryption to provide a measure of reliability. The antenna through \nwhich uplink CMDs are received by the satellite should be omni-directional \nto permit communicating with the satellite even if it is in a momentarily \narbitrary attitude. Purchase the CMD receiver and decryption hardware or \nsoftware.\n\n 1.5.5 Antennas and Power Dividers\u00a0\u2013 The satellite antennas should be selected \nto provide the required gain in all directions. In the case of Earth coverage \ndownlink antennas their peak gain is likely to 3\u20134.5\u00a0dB.\u00a0The antenna should \nbe mounted on the spacecraft so as not to distort the antenna pattern. This is \nusually ensured by building a satellite mockup, mounting the antennas on \nthe mockup, and performing antenna tests, on the combination of antenna \nand spacecraft mockup, either in an anechoic chamber or at an open-range \ntest site. If use of a satellite relay is planned, the antenna must be pointing \nup, and must have considerable beam steering capability in both azimuth \nand elevation. A selection of the antenna combination should be made, and \nthe antennas should be procured, monitoring development during the pro-\ncurement cycle. Power dividers may be used if it is decided that the same \ntransmitter should transmit image and telemetry data. In this case the trans-\nmitter is fed to the high gain antenna for image data transmission, and it is \nalso fed (through a power divider) to an omni-directional antenna for trans-\nmitting low data rate telemetry.\n\n 1.5.6 Communications Processing\u00a0\u2013 The transmitted signals/data must be con-\ntrolled tunable in frequency, the data must be encrypted and randomized (to \nmake its DC component zero) and made compatible with the HDLC proto-\ncol. This is accomplished by a communications processor. The required \ndigital processing may be included in the C&DH, although it may be best \nto separate the C&DH from the communications functions. The processor \nand the software must be developed, and the communication function must \nbe tested with a simulated ground station.\n\n 1.5.7 SDR for the Ground Station\u00a0\u2013 There may be several ground stations. New, \ntransportable ground stations will probably use the modern Software- \nDefined- Radio, while existing ground station with which compatibility is \nrequired probably use legacy radios. If a geostationary relay is used to \nincrease the allowable data rate, the receiver for the ground station probably \nalready exists, and the spacecraft design only needs to concern itself with \nbeing compatible with the ground station demodulator.\n\n 1.6.0 Electric Power System (EPS)\n 1.6.1 EPS Analyses\u00a0\u2013 Compute the OAP (Orbit Average Power) consumption of \n\nthe spacecraft. The power consumption of each subsystem and its duty \ncycle, aggregated over all subsystems, determine the OAP and Peak Power \nrequirements. EPS requirements will be analyzed and battery WH require-\nments will be determined. From these the size and deployment of the solar \npanel will be determined. The EPS architecture will be chosen to select the \n\n19.15 The Work Breakdown Structure\n\n\n\n268\n\nvarious DC/DC converters and their switching. In addition, the number of \ndegrees for deploying the solar arrays for optimum electric power genera-\ntion for the most likely selected orbit will be determined. The result will be \na total analysis of the electric power system and the specification of its \nparts. Coordination with the mechanical design is required to ensure that \nthe planned solar arrays and their deployment mechanisms are compatible \nwith the spacecraft structure design. From the EPS architecture the configu-\nration of charge regulators and DC/DC converters will be selected. There \nwill be a continuing effort to support the program during the development \nphase with EPS analyses and with resolution of emerging issues.\n\n 1.6.2 Solar Array\u00a0\u2013 The solar array resulting from the above analyses will be \ndesigned by designing panels and methods of populating them with solar \ncells to provide the required panel voltages and diode protection from \nreverse currents. The solar panels will also contain additional wiring \nthrough which the panel current flows to minimize the magnetic field pro-\nduces by the panels The deployment mechanisms, other mechanical parts \nand hinges will be designed and fabricated.\n\n 1.6.3 Battery System\u00a0\u2013 The battery system required Watt-Hours (WH) will be \ndetermined. This is the WH required to operate the spacecraft during the \neclipse, plus the charge-discharge inefficiency of the batteries, plus the mar-\ngin to allow for requirement creep, plus degradation of battery performance \nwith temperature and age. The resulting required WH is usually much larger \nthan that calculated from operations during eclipse only. Then the type of \nbatteries to be used will be determined, and, considering redundancy also, \nthe battery system can be defined and the batteries can be procured.\n\n 1.6.4 Charge regulator(s)\u00a0\u2013 Multiple charge regulators (equal to the number of \n\u201cstrings\u201d in the battery system) will be designed, built or procured and \ntested.\n\n 1.6.5 Electric Power Distribution\u00a0 \u2013 The electric bus voltage needs to be \nswitched to the different DC/DC converters to provide switched power for \neach SC component. The converters will be designed or specified, the \nmethod of switching them will be determined, and the power distribution \nsystem will be fabricated or procured. To dissipate the heat generated by the \npower distribution function, the chassis of PCB will be heat sinked to the \nspacecraft structure, and the heat will be conducted away and radiated out \nof the spacecraft.\n\n 1.6.6 EPS Computer and Software\u00a0\u2013 Control over the electric power system \nand collection of EPS telemetry is accomplished by a small computer and \nassociated software. The computer accepts commands from the C&DH, \nimplements these commands by turning EPS components ON or OFF, mon-\nitors telemetry points, and collects telemetry data for subsequent downlink \nto the ground. This computer will be selected, the required EPS software \nwill be written and the hardware and software will be incorporated into the \nEPS.\n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n269\n\n 1.6.7 EPS AIT\u00a0\u2013 When all the components of the entire electric power system are \ncompleted, the EPS will be assembled and the components and the software \nwill be integrated into an EPS system; and the system will be tested with the \nEGSE.\u00a0The test needs to include use of a solar array simulator and a means \nfor simulating the electrical loads on the EPS DC/DC converters.\n\n 1.7.0 Spacecraft Software\u00a0\u2013 All software functions will be described and broken \ninto software modules. The inputs, equations and outputs of each software \nmodule will be generated to become the total software description. Then \ncoding each module will begin, and the code will be archived and updated \nwhenever changes are made. The software will be tested in the target hard-\nware (C&DH, EPS Processor, Communications Processor, ADACS com-\nputer or Image Processor). The six different computers each have their \nindependent software, and communications between them is by file trans-\nfer. The software will be tested first on a module by module level, later on a \nsubsystem level, and finally on an all-up spacecraft level.\n\n 1.8.0 Propulsion\n 1.8.1 Propulsion Analyses\u00a0\u2013 Compute the delta V requirements of the propul-\n\nsion system. Take into account the top level requirements of how much time \nis permitted to deploy the satellite to its station, requirement for station \nkeeping, the requirement regarding how often (or seldom) station keeping \nmaneuvers are permitted, any orbit altitude changes that may have to be \nimplemented, and drag makeup requirements. Then calculate how much \nfuel is required to obtain this delta V.\u00a0For small satellites, a simple cold gas \npropulsion system is sufficient. However, if the required delta V is large, a \nhydrazine propulsion system may be needed. Next the size and pressure in \nthe fuel tanks are computed so that tank size should be manageable and \nshould fit into the spacecraft. Finally the pressure reducer and the thrusters \nare selected, and the thrusters are positioned on the spacecraft. The thrust \nvector should pass through the CG of the spacecraft. If this cannot be guar-\nanteed, or if depletion of fuel changes the position of the CG, multiple \nthrusters should be used, so that intermittent unequal duration thrusts from \nmultiple thrusters should cause the net thrust to pass through the CG and \nshould continue to do so as fuel is exhausted. An alternative way of config-\nuring the thrusters should also be examined. In this approach the spacecraft \nflies horizontally when a delta V maneuver is executed. In fact, the space-\ncraft may be flown horizontally at all times except when the imaging mis-\nsion is to be executed. Then the horizontal spacecraft must be turned so it \nbecomes nadir-pointing. The potential advantage of this system is that \nspacecraft drag is reduced, the CG and CP are nearly co-located,  minimizing \ndrag-induced tip. The thrusters must be placed on the bottom of the space-\ncraft, and multiple thrusters, purposefully slightly misaligned, can be oper-\nated so that the average thrust vector passes through the CG.\u00a0This spacecraft \nflight configuration may also increase mission life, for the drag area of the \nspacecraft is reduced in horizontal flight. On the other hand, this system is \n\n19.15 The Work Breakdown Structure\n\n\n\n270\n\nmore complicated. The alternative propulsion systems will be analyzed and \na baseline propulsion system will be defined.\n\n 1.8.2 Propulsion System Design\u00a0\u2013 The propulsion system specified by the above \nanalyses will be designed, and the components will be selected. The design \nof each propulsion subsystem component is described in subsequent \nsections.\n\n 1.8.2 Fuel Tanks\u00a0\u2013 There are different fuel tanks from which a choice will be \nmade. For cold gas Nitrogen systems, high pressure tanks are available. The \nhighest tank pressure is typically 6000\u00a0psi, but most often 4500\u00a0psi tanks are \nused because they are more readily available. The lightest one of these are \nmade of thin aluminum foil, and they are overwrapped by graphite epoxy \nwebbing to enable them to withstand the high internal pressure. Other high \npressure tanks are made of steel, and they are heavier for the same internal \npressure. For hydrazine propulsion the tanks contain internal bladders to \nseparate the hydrazine from the pressurant. The tanks will be selected and \nprocured.\n\n 1.8.3 Thrusters, Valves and Pressure Reducers\u00a0\u2013 The thrusters, shut off valve, \nthruster control valves, pressure reducers and the plumbing to assemble the \nentire cold gas propulsion system will be selected and purchased. The \nchoice of thrusters influences the propulsion system concept of operation. \nSince cold gas thrusters open or close in about 5\u00a0ms, thrusting granularity is \nlimited to about 5\u00a0 ms. For this reason the thrusters should be relatively \nsmall, so that thrust durations much in excess of 5\u00a0ms should be required. \nAlso, while the operating pressure of the thrusters may be high, care must \nbe taken to select thrusters that operate at low pressure also, because this is \nthe pressure in the fuel tank when the propulsion system stops working. The \nfuel left in the tank at this pressure goes to waste, requiring that a somewhat \nlarger tank be selected.\n\n 1.8.4 Propulsion Electronics\u00a0 \u2013 The electronics required to operate the valves \nand the thrusters will be designed and built. Consideration will be given to \nincorporate a small computer into the propulsion system to give it more \nautonomy and to relieve the computational load from the C&DH or ADACS \ncomputers. The thruster electronics must drive the thrusters and shutoff \nvalve. The thrusters usually require relatively high current at 28\u00a0V.\u00a0For this \nreason separate DC/DC converters may have to be used in the propulsion \nsystem electronics.\n\n 1.8.5 Algorithms Relating to Propulsion System\u00a0\u2013 The algorithms for perform-\ning the maneuvers for turning the SC around whenever thrusting in the \nopposite direction is needed, algorithms to keep the net thrust through the \nSC CG and in the correct direction are required. To sense the instantaneous \ndirection of flight data from the IMU in ADACS will be used. The algo-\nrithm senses changes in direction (or attitude), and determines which of \nmultiple thrusters must be activated, and for how long, to bring the attitude \nback to the desired value.\n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n271\n\n 1.8.6 Propulsion Software\u00a0\u2013 Software will be written to accomplish the algo-\nrithms outlined above. This software will be installed into the target hard-\nware and will be tested.\n\n 1.8.7 Propulsion System AIT\u00a0\u2013 The propulsion system will be assembled by a \nqualified contractor who will perform welding the stainless steel parts. \nWhen assembled and integrated with the propulsion electronics and soft-\nware, the entire propulsion system will be tested under simulated conditions \nwhere the dynamic simulator will introduce thrust aiming errors. The pro-\npulsion system will be a stand-alone subassembly that can be tested without \nthe rest of the SC.\n\n 1.9.0 Miscellaneous\n 1.9.1 Harnessing \u2013 A harness will be fabricated to interconnect the SC hardware \n\ncomponents. The wire list for this hardware will be prepared by electronics \nengineers familiar with all the SC electronics. The harness will then be \nfabricated and installed into the SC, and the harness will be laced and tied \ndown to the chassis and to selected components. The harness will be \nchecked out for wiring errors before turning power on.\n\n 1.9.2 Lab and Flight Spares\u00a0 \u2013 An analysis of the spare requirements will be \nmade, and, in accordance with constraints of the budget, an appropriate \nnumber of spares will be procured or built.\n\n 1.10.0 Testing\n 1.10.1 Functional Tests\u00a0\u2013 Component level testing is done mostly at the vendor \n\nwho supplies the component, or by the spacecraft team, for those compo-\nnents that are built in-house. Once the SC is assembled, functional testing \nwill commence. This consists of operating the SC in every mode possible, \nand testing its performance under all scenario conditions. Test scenarios \nand telemetry or engineering telemetry responses will be collected so that \nexpected and actual performance could be compared. These tests will be \nperformed iteratively at room temperature.\n\n 1.10.2 Test Plans\u00a0\u2013 Test Plans will be written for functional, spacecraft level ther-\nmal, vibration, magnetic grooming, propulsion and thermal vacuum testing. \nIn addition, scenarios for mission simulation testing will also be generated. \nThe Test Plans will specify the objectives of the test, the test procedures and \nlimit values of the test results which, when exceeded, are test failures.\n\n 1.10.3 Component Level Thermal Tests\u00a0\u2013 While overall thermal testing will be \nperformed on the all-up spacecraft level, certain components, for which the \nmanufacturer of that component has not performed thermal testing prior to \ndelivery, will be thermal tested prior to incorporation into the SC.\u00a0These \ninclude the ADACS, which is an in-house built subsystem, the digital sub-\nsystem and the telescope. Thermal testing over a\u00a0?\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C to +55\u00a0\u00b0C tem-\nperature range will be performed.\n\n 1.10.4 SC Level Thermal Testing\u00a0\u2013 The entire spacecraft will be placed in a tem-\nperature chamber and tested over the temperature range mentioned above. \nThree failure free test sequences are required for the spacecraft to pass ther-\nmal testing. During the test the spacecraft will execute a scenario that will \n\n19.15 The Work Breakdown Structure\n\n\n\n272\n\nexercise all functions of the spacecraft. Thermal testing is one of the most \nimportant tests for it uncovers latent hardware problems. Seldom is there a \nthermal vacuum test failure if the spacecraft passed thermal testing.\n\n 1.10.5 SC Level Vibration Testing\u00a0\u2013 The spacecraft will undergo sine sweep and \nrandom vibration tests in all three axes. The sine sweep test will determine \nthe spacecraft resonant frequencies that will be compared with those pre-\ndicted by the structural analysis. Random vibration testing will be per-\nformed to the GEVS vibration input levels, unless the (launch vehicle) LV \npermits a lower level of vibrational excitation. The spacecraft will be \ninspected for deformation or cracks after the vibration test, and the optical \nperformance of the telescope-camera combination will be retested to assure \nthat there has been no degradation.\n\n 1.10.6 Magnetic Grooming\u00a0\u2013 The spacecraft will be put into a large Helmholz \ncoil facility where the residual magnetic moment of the spacecraft will be \ndetermined, and the bias will be removed by compensating permanent mag-\nnets. Also, the magnetometer will be operated to ensure that its readings are \ncorrect and not biased due to any residual spacecraft magnetic flux.\n\n 1.10.7 Propulsion Testing\u00a0\u2013 The propulsion system and its control electronics will \nbe tested to verify that the system is able to produce long duration (60\u00a0s) of \nthrust in a direction that passes through the CG of the spacecraft, as deter-\nmined by the spacecraft net angular acceleration. In addition, the total thrust \nlevel will be measured and compared with the nominal thrust required of \nthe propulsion system.\n\n 1.10.8 Thermal Vacuum Testing\u00a0\u2013 The spacecraft will undergo 3\u00a0cycles of failure \nfree thermal vacuum testing while the spacecraft will operate and imple-\nment a realistic mission-like scenario.\n\n 1.10.9 Mission Simulation Testing\u00a0 \u2013 At room temperature the spacecraft will \nundergo testing under a variety of mission scenarios that exercise all functions \nof the spacecraft. The commands from the EGSE will be uplinked (through \nRF) to the spacecraft, which will execute the commands, and will communi-\ncate to the EGSE by RF (images and telemetry). The Dynamic Simulator will \nbe connected to the spacecraft through the EGSE to \u201cfly\u201d the spacecraft in \naccordance with the torque and reaction wheel activity of the spacecraft \nADACS, and will generate corresponding simulated spacecraft attitude sensor \ninformation, which it will present to the spacecraft via the EGSE.\n\n 1.11.0 GSE and Ground Station\n 1.11.1 Mechanical GSE\u00a0\u2013 Fixtures to support the spacecraft in various attitudes in \n\nthe laboratory, to rotate it automatically for sun sensor testing, and fixtures \nfor horizontal or vertical integration with the LV or the LV Adaptor will be \nconstructed. Removable lifting fixtures and a transportation container will \nalso be built to permit handling and transporting the spacecraft.\n\n 1.11.1 Electronic GSE\u00a0\u2013 EGSE will power, command and communicate with the \nspacecraft in the laboratory and at the launch facility. The EGSE will be \ndesigned and constructed. The EGSE will also include the Dynamic \nSimulator to enable testing with hardware-in-the-loop. The EGSE will also \n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n273\n\nenable performance of a complete automatic verification test, complete \nfrom scenario upload to the automatic collection of test data and its com-\nparison with the expected data. This is an important piece of hardware, for \nit accelerates the repetitious test of the spacecraft, and thus saves a lot of \nmoney.\n\n 1.12.0 Stand-Alone Ground Station\u00a0\u2013 Often the customer wants to operate the \nspacecraft independently of other organizations. In this case a stand-alone \nground station is required. A ground station from which the constellation of \nspacecraft can be controlled and operated will be designed, built, tested and \nintegrated with the spacecraft. Based on the link studies, the size of the \nground station antenna has been determined. Let us say it was 3.5\u00a0m. The \nStand-Alone Ground Station will be able to generate spacecraft commands, \nreceive and recover their telemetry and image data transmissions, program \nthe spacecraft of the constellation to operate in any area of the world based \non the commands received from the stand-alone ground station. In response \nto these imaging requirements, the Ground Station will be able to command \nthe various spacecraft to perform maneuvers to image the required targets.\n\n 1.11.3 Ground Station Transmitter\u00a0\u2013 A transmitter capable of integration with \nthe Ground Station will be procured and integrated with the 3.5\u00a0m antenna \nand receive subsystem to complete the RF hardware of the Ground Station. \nThe heart of this ground stations is the Software Defined Radio (SDR) \nwhich generates the transmitted modulated RF signal for transmission to \nthe spacecraft and which receives, demodulates and decrypts the received \nRF signals to input to the Ground Station computers and displays. A SDR \nwill be constructed for the Ground Station.\n\n 1.11.4 Ground Station Antenna \u2013 The 3.5\u00a0m ground station antenna, the antenna \nfeed, the diplexer, and the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) will be specified and \nprocured. If communications with the spacecraft via a GEO relay is used, \nthe ground station antenna system will have to operate at L-Band, or a sepa-\nrate L-Band antenna system has to be procured.\n\n19.16  Cost\n\nProject cost is built up by estimating the cost in man-hours and materials or subcon-\ntractor cost of each WBS element. The total cost of the project is then the sum of the \nburdened labor plus material cost of all WBS elements. To this the Program Manager \nshould add his management reserve to obtain the total program cost, which must be \nwithin his budget.\n\nWhen first generated at the beginning of the program, the program cost arrived at \nin this way, usually exceeds available funds. It is then the task of the Program \nManager to alter technical approaches and manpower estimates to bring program \ntotal cost within budget. This is a difficult process, but one that must be done rigor-\nously and repeated frequently.\n\n19.16 Cost\n\n\n\n274\n\n19.17  Scheduling\n\nIn addition to costing each WBS element, the duration of performing each WBS \nmust also be estimated and the resulting bar representing the performance period \nmust be placed on the schedule chart at the time the task is to be initiated. WBS ele-\nments that depend on completion of other WBS elements are placed at consecutive \nintervals on the schedule chart.\n\nAt this time the names of the people who will perform the work defined by the \nWBS are also identified. The WBS performance periods must be so scheduled that \nthe same people should not (unintentionally) be assigned to other WBS elements as \nwell, for this would create a schedule conflict, resulting in a schedule slip.\n\nHaving identified the people who will work on each given WBS, the cost of each \nWBS can be recalculated to improve overall program cost accuracy.\n\nThe cost as a function of time can be constructed by adding up the sum of WBS \ncost elements versus time. In this way the cost expenditure profile of the program \ncan be exhibited and compared to the costs incurred to date.\n\nUse of the Gantt chart (available by many software manufacturers) is a simple \nway to perform scheduling and costing the manpower portions of each WBS, and of \nthe entire program. The Gantt chart lays out each WBS on successive lines of the \nchart, while calendar time is on the horizontal axis. It allows for specifying the start \nand completion of each WBS and assuring that interdependence of WBS schedules \nare observed and maintained. It also provides an easily understood graphic display \nof the time line and of significant events and milestones in the development process. \nIt also displays the cost profile of the program.\n\n19.18  Critical Path\n\nThe total program performance period is determined by the Critical Path. This is the \npath of consecutively performed WBS tasks that take the longest, and determine the \nminimum duration of the program.\n\nThe Critical Path, when the schedule is first constructed, may indicate that the \nprogram cannot be performed within the allocated schedule, or that the start times \nof certain WBS must be moved to an earlier date to permit completing the program \non schedule.\n\nThe Program Manger must ensure that the schedule be realistic and that perform-\ning the tasks according to the schedule will bring in the total program within the \nrequired time period.\n\nTo facilitate constructing such a schedule there must be slack periods built into \nthe realistic schedule. These are periods that can be used up by the designers with-\nout impacting the overall program schedule. A schedule without slack periods is \nprobably an unrealistic schedule.\n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n275\n\n19.19  Schedule Slack\n\nThere are sequences of WBS elements (such as the design, fabrication and testing \nof the electric power subsystem) where the performance period of the sequence of \ntasks is short enough that by starting the sequence at a given time will result in the \ncompletion of the subsystem before it is needed in the overall spacecraft build, inte-\ngration and test process.\n\nTherefore the development of this subsystem contains a schedule slack, a period \nof time that can be used up before it impacts the overall schedule.\n\nThe Program Manager should assure that, if possible, each sequence of interde-\npendent tasks should contain schedule slack. This, of course, is an unrealizable \ndream. However, some slack should be built into the schedule of tasks to minimize \nthe risk of overall schedule slip.\n\n19.20  Earned Cost\n\nIt was mentioned above, that the predicted program cost profile can be obtained \nfrom the cumulative sum of the costs of each WBS versus time. The earned cost of \nthe program can be calculated from the cumulative cost of the completed WBS ele-\nments and from the estimated cost earned by the partially completed WBS costs.\n\nIn other words, a completed WBS earned the cost of the cost assigned to that \nWBS.\u00a0If the actual cost was larger than programmed, the additional cost is an over-\nrun. If the actual cost is less than programmed, the cost difference adds to the man-\nagement reserve of the Program Manager.\n\nContinuous computation and monitoring of the earned cost and its comparison \nwith the predicted cost profile must be performed very frequently. Without this com-\nparison the Program Manager has no way of knowing where he stands on bringing \nthe program to completion within budget.\n\nIf the earned cost is significantly smaller than the predicted cost profile, the \nProgram Manger must develop means for reducing the cost forward of the remain-\ning WBS elements. This is a challenging task.\n\n19.21  Cost to\u00a0Complete Calculation\n\nAnother computation that is important to perform every once in awhile is the com-\nputation of the Cost-To-Complete.\n\nThe cost-to-complete reexamines each not yet completed WBS element and re- \nestimates its cost from its present status or knowledge. The cost-to-complete is then \nthe sum of the new WBS costing versus time from now to the end of the project.\n\n19.21 Cost to Complete Calculation\n\n\n\n276\n\nThis must be done carefully and accurately. Normal Augustine, then Deputy \nSecretary of the Army, used to say, based on Army data, that a Program Manager \nusually underestimates the cost-to-complete at any time by some 30%. The space-\ncraft Program Manger should make sure that he is not this type of a Program Manger.\n\n19.22  Requirements Creep and\u00a0Engineering Change \nProposal.\n\nDuring the performance of the program, changes are often proposed. Some of these \nare within the scope of customer requirements, but others exceed the requirements \nscope. The program should not perform the out of scope changes without receiving \ncompensation for their costs.\n\nThe Engineering Change Proposal is the vehicle by which the cost of out of \nscope proposed changes are brought to the customer for adoption and funding, or \nfor cancellation of the requested change.\n\nThe customer is often enthusiastic about \u201cnice to have\u201d additional capabilities \nuntil the cost of these additional capabilities is brought to his attention. He then \nmust often back down and give up on the nice-to-have performance enhancements \nbecause of limitations of his own budget.\n\n19.23  Reallocating Budgets, Cost Management\n\nDuring program performance it is often realized that specific subsystems and their \nassociated WBS costs and schedules were underestimated, while the costs of others \nwere overestimated. The Program Manager must then reallocate budgets to provide \nmore money and time to some and take away money from others.\n\nTaking away money is a difficult task that often alienates those from whom \nmoney is taken away. Yet it must be done.\n\nThe budgets of tasks must be changed dynamically by the Program Manger to \nkeep from overrunning the program. This is contrary to usually accepted program \nmanagement practices. Yet without this program management flexibility it is diffi-\ncult to run a program successfully.\n\n19.24  Documentation\n\nDocumentation requirements of a satellite development program are extensive. \nThey start with the Technical Proposal and continue with tradeoff documentation, \nPreliminary Design Review and Critical Design Review documentation. The set of \n\n19 Systems Engineering and\u00a0Program Management\n\n\n\n277\n\nTest Plans, Test Reports and the reports for the specific requested Technical \nInterchange Meetings (TIM) add to the volume of documentation. Interface Control \nDocuments between subsystems and the launch vehicle, Preship Review and Launch \nSite Procedures complete the list of documents.\n\n19.25  Test Plans and\u00a0Test Reports\n\nPreceding tests of the spacecraft subsystems, and the spacecraft as a system, test \nplans should be prepared. The test plans include:\n\n (a) Mechanical static load test. This test subjects the spacecraft structure (often \nwith mass mockups of the electronic components) to loads that correspond to \nthe maximum forces elements of the structure will see. The test exhibits the \nstrains and deformations of the structure. Test results may require modifying \nsome structural elements to increase the static loads margins.\n\n (b) Electric Subsystem test plan. This test plan is constructed to expose the electric \npower subsystem to a realistic mission environment where solar panel outputs \nare simulated as a function of time. The electric power stored in the batteries \nand the power generated at various voltages in the system are monitored over a \ntemperature range corresponding to what the EPS subsystem will experience.\n\nMany other test plans are prepared. These include, but are not necessarily limited \nto:\n\n (c) Digital Subsystem Test Plan\n (d) Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem Test Plan\n (e) Antenna Test Plan\n (f) RF Subsystem Test Plan\n (g) Propulsion Subsystem Test Plan\n (h) Vibration Test Plan\n (i) Thermal Test Plan\n (j) Acoustic Test Plan\n (k) Thermal Vacuum Test Plan\n (l) Magnetic Grooming Test Plan\n\nThe test plans often include the expected results and the test values that, when \nexceeded, indicate that the subsystem or test article failed the test.\n\nThe results of individual tests should be included in reports in detail to permit \nassessing the adequacy of the subsystem or the full-up spacecraft.\n\n19.25 Test Plans and\u00a0Test Reports\n\n\n\n279\u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2018 \nG. Sebestyen et al., Low Earth Orbit Satellite Design, Space Technology \nLibrary 36, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7_20\n\nChapter 20\nA Spacecraft Design Example\n\nThis example of a spacecraft design problem is given so that the reader can put to \nwork what he or she has learned by reading this book. While the \u201cRequirements\u201d \nare clear, they are not very specific. There is not one good answer or design to meet \nthe requirements.\n\n20.1  The Spacecraft Mission Requirements\n\nIn this hypothetical case, we assume that several organizations of the news media \ngot together and decided that they would jointly fund a spacecraft that would be on \norbit all the time, and that could be commanded to image news events taking place \nanywhere on Earth. They heard that one can buy such a spacecraft for under $10 \nmillion (plus launch costs). It turns out that the $8 million spacecraft the media \nheard about had a 1\u00a0m GSD.\u00a0The customer stated that the resolution should be suf-\nficient to generate good colored pictures that could be published in newspapers, and \non-orbit life should be at least 5\u00a0years. To assist the spacecraft designer, the custom-\ners agreed that they could send humans to places readily accessible by plane and \nautomobile. They wanted the satellite primarily to image events happening in \nremote or politically inaccessible areas.\n\n20.2  Derived Technical Requirements\n\nThe first thing to decide is how the customer-stated requirements can be translated \nto technical requirements. What should be the spacecraft resolution? It is known \nfrom photogrammetry that the relationship between target dimensions and the num-\nber of pixels needed follow approximate rules given in Fig.\u00a020.1. Applying these to \nsome of the likely targets, we obtain the table shown in Fig.\u00a020.2.\n\n\n\n280\n\nIt is seen that, ideally, resolution should be on the order of 20\u201350\u00a0cm to recognize \nthe various targets. This is a very tall order and one that is extremely expensive to \nfill. It has been stated that the cost of an imaging system varies approximately as the \n2.5th power of the resolution. So, if the customer can afford a 1 meter resolution \nsystem, going to 50\u00a0cm would increase the cost by a factor of 5.65, and reducing \nresolution to 25\u00a0cm would increase cost by a factor of 56. So, obviously, the cus-\ntomer\u2019s budget would be exceeded; he needs to decide what resolution is acceptable \nand affordable.\n\nThe customer is shown a set of targets imaged with different resolutions to give \nhim a feel for what the pictures from the spacecraft might look like. For example, \nthe image of the ship shown in Fig.\u00a020.3 was taken with 1 meter resolution. It might \nbe quite acceptable for a newspaper photograph. One can clearly see from that \nimage that there are no people on deck, that there is no damage to the ship, and one \ncan make out the name of the ship. Clearly, 25\u00a0cm resolution would be much better, \nbut if the 1 meter resolution spacecraft cost $8 million, would the customer pay $45 \nmillion for one with 25\u00a0cm resolution?\n\nLet us say that the customer decided that he can afford to pay 20.5 million and \nget a 75\u00a0cm resolution imaging spacecraft. He states with seriousness that this is the \nmost he can afford to pay. Of course, the customer realizes that this spacecraft is \ngoing to be quite a bit heavier than the 1\u00a0m resolution spacecraft, so the launch costs \nwould also increase significantly.\n\nNext, the orbit should be selected. Since the spacecraft must be able to image any \nplace on Earth, a Polar orbit or a Sun-Synchronous orbit come to mind. Imaging \nwill be a daytime operation, so a Sun-Synchronous orbit is selected.\n\nThe telescope aperture must satisfy the equation in Fig. 2.4. For 0.75\u00a0 m \nGSD\u00a0=\u00a01.22*?*H/D.\u00a0Therefore, for ?\u00a0=\u00a05.5*10?6, H/D must be 111,773. For a 35\u00a0cm \naperture, the orbit altitude should be 391\u00a0 km. There is too much atmosphere at \n391\u00a0km; and a 5-year mission life cannot be achieved at that altitude without a drag \nmakeup propulsion system. So the altitude should be raised to at least 550\u00a0km to \nachieve 5-year life without propulsion (see Fig. 3.15). At that altitude the telescope \n\nDetection Orientation Recognition Identification Technical Description\n5 pixels 18 pixels 40 pixels 200 pixels 500 pixels\n\nFig. 20.1 Number of pixels on target for various degrees of identification\n\nItem Length \nm\n\nWidth \nm\n\nDetect\nm/pixel\n\nRecognize\nm/pixel\n\nIdentify\ncm/pixel\n\nDescribe\ncm/pixel\n\n5-Ton Truck 7.9 2.5 1.5 0.20 4.0 1.5\nCar 4.5 1.8 0.9 0.11 2.3 0.9\nSmall Bldg 10.0 10 2.0 0.25 5.0 2.0\nTank 8.5 3.7 1.7 0.21 4.3 1.7\nSmall A/C 40 30 8.0 1.00 20.0 8.0\nCrater 138 138 27.6 3.45 69.0 27.6\nDestroyer 122 10 24.4 3.05 61.0 24.4\n\nFig. 20.2 Resolution needed for ground targets and various identification criteria\n\n20 A Spacecraft Design Example\n\n\n\n281\n\naperture should be 49.2\u00a0cm. This might increase the cost of the system by a factor \nof 2.3 and would break the budget.\n\nIf the spacecraft is flown at 391\u00a0km to keep the aperture at 35\u00a0cm (the baseline \ncost), a propulsion system is needed for drag makeup with an estimated ?V of \n50\u00a0m/s. While having a propulsion system complicates the spacecraft, its cost impact \nis relatively small; certainly the cost growth does not compare with the cost increase \ndue to a larger aperture.\n\nLaunch vehicle selection, while never easy, is not too difficult to a Polar or Sun- \nSynchronous orbit. With a 2-3\u00a0year leadtime, it should be possible to get manifested \nto a suitable mission as a secondary payload.\n\nTo flow down the customer requirements to the ADACS subsystem, it is recog-\nnized that there was nothing said by the customer that would suggest that the space-\ncraft should be very agile. That is good, as agility also means a larger set of reaction \nwheels, greater power consumption and more cost.\n\nSince the spacecraft would have to slew to the target to image it, a 3-axis zero- \nmomentum system with 3 reaction wheels is indicated. If the camera CCD has \n5.5\u00a0?m pixels, and it takes 16 MPixel images with an aspect ratio of 3/2, then each \nimage will be 3265 \u00d7 4899 pixels. At 75\u00a0cm per pixel, the image will be 1633 meter \n\u00d7 3674 meter (at nadir). This is probably much larger than any area the customer \nwants to image. Therefore, the pointing accuracy can be relaxed, as long as the tar-\nget remains in the FOV of the image. Assume that pointing accuracy of 400 meters \nis sufficient. The target will be within about 14% of the center of the image. Pointing \naccuracy of 400\u00a0m at 391\u00a0km altitude is \u00b10.058\u00b0 accuracy. Thus attitude sensing to \nan accuracy of about 0.028\u00b0 is required and suggests the use of 2 star trackers.\n\nThe resulting set of preliminary Technical Requirements is shown in Fig.\u00a020.4.\n\nFig. 20.3 A ship image taken with 1\u00a0m GSD\n\n20.2 Derived Technical Requirements\n\n\n\n282\n\n20.3  Preliminary Design\n\nBefore the detailed design of the spacecraft can begin, the solar array configuration \nand the method of thrusting should be considered.\n\nIn a sun synchronous orbit, the sun is always in the same direction relative to the \nspacecraft. Therefore a set of fixed deployable panels, like those shown in Fig.\u00a020.5 \ncan be used. The set would supply electric power to the spacecraft very efficiently.\n\nIt is not simple to figure out where the propulsion thrusters should be so that the \nthrust vector would go through the CG of the spacecraft. The 4- thruster configura-\ntion shown in Fig. 11.6, and a thrusting regimen like that shown in Fig. 11.15, \n however, is one arrangement that works for this case.\n\nOrbit Altitude 391 km\nInclination Polar or Sun Synch\nImager\nTelescope Aperture 35 cm\nFocal Length TBD (#f/8 to #f/10)\nCamera 16 MPixel, 5.5 \u00b5m/pixel\nADACS\n3-axis zero momentum stabilized 3 Reaction Wheels\nPointing Accuracy \u00b10.058\u00b0\nAttitude Sensing \u00b10.028\u00b0 with 2 Star Trackers\nPropulsion ?50 m ?V Cold Gas or Hydrazine\nDimension s TBD\nWeight TBD\n\nFig. 20.4 Preliminary specifications of the imaging spacecraft\n\nFig. 20.5 The spacecraft configuration with fixed deployable solar panels shown stowed and \nwith panels deployed\n\n20 A Spacecraft Design Example\n\n\n\n283\n\n20.4  Design Steps\n\nNow that the customer requirements have led to a more specific set of technical \nrequirements, the reader should undertake the design of the spacecraft as an  exercise. \nThe design steps are outlined below:\n\n 1.

The orbit altitude \nis the altitude where the acceleration of gravity is equal to the centrifugal accel-\neration of the satellite at the orbital velocity. The acceleration of gravity varies \ninversely with the square of the altitude. At the surface of the Earth it is 9.8\u00a0m/s2, \nor 32.174\u00a0ft/s2.\n\nADACS Attitude Determination And Control Subsystem of a spacecraft. With its \noptical, magnetic and infrared sensors the ADACS can determine the spacecraft \nattitude. Using a GPS receiver on the spacecraft, it can also determine space-\ncraft positions. It contains a computer that calculates the best attitude from the \nmultiple sensors, and it computes torque rod and reaction wheel commands to \nexecute commanded attitude changes. It also interfaces with these actuators to \nimplement the required attitude changes.\n\nAlbedo Reflected infrared radiation from the surface of Earth.\nBaffle A light shield that shields an optical system from light entering it from out-\n\nside the field of view (FOV).\nBallistic coefficient The ratio of the spacecraft mass to its drag. The drag is atmo-\n\nspheric density times the drag coefficient. For spacecraft the drag coefficient \nis usually about 2.2. The ballistic coefficient is a measure of how resistant the \nobject is to deceleration due to atmospheric drag. Satellites typically have bal-\nlistic coefficients in the 60\u2013200\u00a0kg/m2 range.\n\nBeta (\u00df) The angle between the sun vector and the plane of the orbit. For Beta\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0 \nthe sun is normal to the orbit, and the sun incidence on the spacecraft is maximum.\n\nCamera pixels The camera image sensor is composed of Y rows of X sensors, \nproviding X*Y spots or pixels of which an image is composed. There are typi-\ncally two methods of arranging pixels in a camera. In a \u201cpush-broom\u201d camera the \npixels are all in 1 or 2 rows, and the image is taken, like a push broom, by letting \nthe satellite sweep out a rectangular area over time. The other method of arranging \n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68315-7\n\n\n302\n\npixels is in a staring sensor, like in ordinary commercial cameras, where the \npixels are arranged in a rectangular array.\n\nCMOS sensor Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor is a technology often \nused for constructing image sensors, instead of the more often used CCD (Charge \nCoupled Device) sensors.\n\nCMG The control moment gyro is an attitude control device used in spacecraft. \nThe rotor of the gyro spins continuously, and when a change, or slew, of space-\ncraft attitude is required, a torque is applied at right angles to the shaft of the \nrotor, causing the gyro to presses, which, in turn, causes the spacecraft to change \nattitude also. The CMG is often used instead of a reaction wheel, for it may \nimprove the agility of the spacecraft by offering higher torque at the expense of \nhigher power consumption and mass.\n\nCOTS Commercial Off-The-Shelf.\nCPA Closest Point of Approach.\nCubeSat Small satellites that conform to a set of specifications and are 10\u00a0 cm \n\ncubes (1\u00a0U), 10\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0cm (2\u00a0U), 10\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0cm (3\u00a0U) or \nlarger, up to 6\u00a0U (at this time).\n\nDiffraction limit The minimum angular separation between images that can be \nresolved. When expressing the ground resolution capabilities of a space tele-\nscope, the diffraction limit is the minimum distance on the ground that can \nbe resolved by a space telescope of given aperture. The diffraction limit is \nDL\u00a0=\u00a01.22*?*H/D, where ? is the wavelength of the light, H is the orbit altitude \nand D is the diameter of the optical aperture.\n\nDisturbance torques Small environmental torques acting on a spacecraft. They \ninclude gravitational field variations, aerodynamic drag forces or torques caused \nby an offset between the Center of Gravity and Center of Pressure of a space-\ncraft, magnetic torques induced by residual magnetic moments, solar radiation \ntorques and torques induced by leaks of fuel or other matter on the spacecraft.\n\nEarth horizon sensor Used on spacecraft to determine the direction of the Earth \nhorizon in spacecraft coordinates. There are at least two different kinds of Earth \nhorizon sensors. The legacy sensors are mechanically rotating infrared detecting \nnarrow beams. The axis of rotation is close to horizontal and normal to the orbit \nplane. The line of sight is skewed, causing a conical scan path. When the receiving \nbeam intersects the Earth limb, the IR signature of the Earth causes the received \nsignal to rise; when the receiving beam no longer intersects the Earth, the signal \ndrops. The bisector of the resulting pulse is when the beam pointed straight down. \nThis is used as the pitch attitude in pitch bias momentum stabilized satellites. The \nother type of Earth horizon sensor uses a set of individual IR sensors covering an \narc on the satellite that straddles the Earth limb. The direction of the Earth limb \nis determined from the specific individual detectors, depending on whether they \nreceive or do not receive Earth IR energy. The accuracy of Earth horizon sensors \nis typically in the range of 0.5\u20131.5\u00b0.\n\nEarth oblateness Earth is not spherical. The radius to the North and South Poles is \nshorter than the radius to the Equator by a factor of 1/297. This causes orbit nodal \nprecession and Earth sensor attitude estimation errors.\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\n303\n\nEclipse The fraction of the orbit when the sun is not visible to the satellite. At low \norbit and Beta\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 the maximum eclipse is about 35\u00a0min.

It is almost \ncompletely non-conducting.\n\nGravity gradient The gravity gradient boom makes use of the decrease of the \nacceleration of gravity with increasing altitude, the gravity gradient, to stabi-\nlize a spacecraft equipped with a long vertical boom and tip mass. The gravity \ngradient over the length of the boom generates a difference in force acting on \nthe tip mass versus on the spacecraft body. This creates a pendulum from the \nspacecraft and tip mass which causes the spacecraft to assume an Earth point-\ning attitude. Vertical pitch and roll pointing accuracy of a few degrees can be \nachieved.\n\nGSD Ground Sample Distance is the resolution of the system on the surface of the \nEarth.\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\n304\n\nHeat pipe A conductor of heat typically containing an aluminum pipe and a working \nfluid inside it.

It is also used \nin the propulsion system for the same reason.\n\nInvar A metal alloy of iron and Nickel. When the percentage of Nickel is about \n36%, the metal has nearly zero temperature coefficient. It is for this reason the \nInvar 36 is often used as structural elements in space telescope design.\n\nITU International Telecommunication Union.\nJ2000 The Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate system origin is at the center of \n\nthe Earth. In a specific ECI coordinate system, the J2000 coordinate system, the \nx axis points in the direction of the mean equinox. The z axis is in the direction \nof the Earth spin axis, and the y axis is 90\u00b0 East from the celestial equator. This \ncoordinate system is used in spacecraft ADACS.\n\nKalman filter A computational method that determines the best least squared \nestimate (of attitude) on orbit from the various attitude sensors on a spacecraft. \nUsually, the star tracker and the IMU estimates of attitude are used to obtain a \nmore accurate attitude estimate.\n\nApogee kick motor Usually a solid propellant rocket motor (like the ATK STAR \nseries of motors) used to circularize the orbit of a satellite after the booster took \nit to the correct altitude. Since the satellite is separated from the launch vehicle \nat the apogee of the orbit, the motor is called apogee kick motor.\n\nLink margin The number of dB above the amount of RF signal that must exist at \nthe RF receiver output to achieve signal reception with a given bit error rate. For \nexample, for receiving incoherent FSK signals at a BER (Bit Error Rate) of 10?5, \nabout 15\u00a0dB more signal than the per bit signal versus noise energy is required. \nIf\u00a0the signal is larger than that, the link margin is the excess signal, expressed in dB.\n\nLVLH The Local Vertical, Local Horizontal reference frame is used in Earth point-\ning spacecraft. The +X direction is in the direction of orbit velocity, +Y is the \nnegative orbit normal, and +Z is to the nadir.\n\nGlossary\n\n\n\n305\n\nMarman band Used to secure the spacecraft to the launch vehicle. The Marman \nBand consists of two semicircular machined bands, hinged together at one end \nand held together with a frangible bolt at the other end, with which the satellite \nand the launch vehicle are secured to each other. The satellite and launch vehicle \nmating surfaces are beveled, and so are the Marman Band semicircular rings, so \nthat when the band is secured, it squeezed the spacecraft and the launch vehicle \ntogether. When on orbit, and the spacecraft needs to be separated from the launch \nvehicle, the frangible bolt is severed, usually with an explosive cutter, so as to \nseparate the spacecraft from the launch vehicle.\n\nMLI Multi Layer Insulation. These are blankets, consisting of multiple layers of \ninsulating materials and reflective or absorptive finishes. They are used to cover \nthe exterior surfaces of parts of a satellite, as part of its thermal control system.\n\nMGSE Mechanical Ground Support Equipment. The mechanical fixtures used to \nlift, turn or otherwise handle the spacecraft are collectively called MGSE.\n\nMTF Modulation Transfer Function is a measure of the spatial resolution of an \noptical system. Like in electronics, where the transfer function expresses the \namplitude and phase changes from input to output of electronic circuits at each \nfrequency, the MTF similarly expresses the input-output relationship of an opti-\ncal system as a function of the granularity of the input image. MTF\u00a0=\u00a01 is perfect \ntransmission, while MTF\u00a0=\u00a00.1 provides a marginally acceptable picture.\n\nNASTRAN A Finite Element mathematical model, used to compute structural \nvibrational modes.

At high RPM the reaction wheel can store a large angular momentum, \ncausing the spacecraft to have a stable attitude. When accelerating, the resulting \ntorque creates an angular momentum, which causes the spacecraft to change \nattitude (by conservation of the system\u2019s angular momentum).\n\nRecontact When two objects in space are released or expelled from each other, \nthen there are two bodies with very slightly different velocities in the same orbit. \nIt is possible that some time in the future (usually an integer number of orbits \nlater) the two bodies may collide (or recontact) each other. For this reason a \nrecontact analysis is conducted to ensure that this does not happen.\n\nRAAN Right Ascention of the Ascending Node. Indicates the geocentric right ascen-\nsion of a satellite as it intersects the Equator traveling in a Northerly direction.\n\nSatellite pass The part of the orbit visible to an observer on the ground. The satellite \nrises above the local horizon, progresses to the highest ground elevation point. \nIt then sets by dropping below the horizon. Pass durations for LEO satellites are \ntypically a maximum of about 12\u00a0min.\n\nSeparation system The mechanism used to secure the spacecraft to the launch \nvehicle, and to separate the two on command. The most frequently used separation \nsystem is the Marman band, described elsewhere in this Glossary. A motorized \nLightband, built by Planetary Systems Corp. does not use explosive bolts to \nrelease the band, and therefore imparts less shock to both the spacecraft and the \nlaunch vehicle.\n\nSEU Single Event Upset.
