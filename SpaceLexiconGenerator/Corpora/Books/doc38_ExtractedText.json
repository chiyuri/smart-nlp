Obviously a great deal has changed in that\ntime, which is of course reflected in the current book\u2019s content. However, one aspect that\nhas remained constant throughout that time is the influence that the US Space Shuttle has\nhad as the work-horse of the West\u2019s human spaceflight programme.\n\nThe Shuttle\u2019s first launch three decades ago, in 1981, was for me one of those landmark\nevents that somehow spurs the memory to recall exactly where you were and what you\nwere doing at the time. For me, the 12th of April 1981 was a glorious spring day, during\nwhich my wife and I enjoyed the climb of a peak in the remote north-west Highlands of\nScotland. However, sensing the historic character of the day\u2019s events, I do recall a resolve\nat the end of that glorious day to find out how the first historic flight of Shuttle Columbia\nhad gone. The subsequent history of the Shuttle programme is well documented. Despite\nthe high cost of operations, the programme has overall been hugely successful, but also\novershadowed by the human cost of desperate tragedies. Coming full circle, this year sees\nthe retirement of this remarkable machine, again an event with a personal dimension\u2014the\ncommencement and retirement of the Shuttle\u2019s space career have coincided closely with\nmy own career in the space industry and academia! Consequently, like an old friend, it\u2019s\nalways been there.\n\nThe Shuttle retirement has inevitably forced a rethink of the US human spaceflight\nprogramme. As a consequence, the Bush administration proposed the Constellation pro-\ngramme which centred on a new crewed spacecraft Orion. This was to be lifted to orbit by\nthe Shuttle replacement\u2014the man-rated Ares 1 launcher. The other significant component\nof the programme was a heavy-lift launch vehicle called Ares 5, which would indepen-\ndently orbit the massive payloads required for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The\nmain objectives of the programme were a return to the moon by 2020, and preparations\nfor a crewed landing on Mars in the longer term. However, the incoming Obama admin-\nistration has effectively overturned the \u2018Bush vision\u2019, throwing open the development of\nhuman access to orbit to private venture, abandoning the immediate prospect of human\nexploration beyond Earth orbit, and extending the lifetime of the International Space Sta-\ntion to 2020. In the short-term this has led to the rather bizarre situation of focusing\nUS human spaceflight activities on Earth orbit, but without the independent means of\nUS astronauts to reach it. At the time of writing, the future development of US human\nspaceflight is unclear, which raises the prospect that the next footprints on the moon\u2019s\nsurface may be those of Chinese taikonauts. As far as the book content is concerned,\n\n\n\nxvi PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION\n\nthis has not been a good time to attempt to write about this aspect of space activity.\nFor example, reference to the Space Shuttle is minimal throughout the current edition,\nand the emphasis in the launch vehicles section (Chapter 7) is on the European Ariane\nlauncher programme (although there is some discussion of the Ares launchers, which in\nthe fullness of time may, or may not, be relevant).\n\nThe majority of the book content, however, focuses on the design and engineering of\nunmanned spacecraft, and around the turn of the millennium, the \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019\ndesign philosophy was particularly influential in reducing the size and mass of science\nspacecraft in particular. However, this has been tempered somewhat by the occurrence of\ninopportune in-orbit failures, which have provided lessons that maybe faster and cheaper\nare not necessarily better. However, the explosion of interest in small, capable spacecraft\ncontinues unabated, and this is reflected in an updated Chapter 18 on small satellite\nengineering.\n\nAt the other end of the size range, there are a number of major robotic spacecraft\nprogrammes that will be making the headlines soon after this edition hits the book shelves.\nPerhaps, the most significant of these is the follow-on to the Hubble Space Telescope,\nwhich has been christened the James Webb Space Telescope. This is to be launched in\naround 2014 to the L2 Sun-Earth Lagrange point, around 1.5 million km from Earth.\nWith a mirror nearly three times the size of Hubble\u2019s, the scientists are looking forward\nto an explosion of new cosmological discoveries resulting from its operation. At the same\ntime, the ESA comet probe Rosetta should be beginning its mission in orbit around comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and it is anticipated that the Rosetta data will provide a\nstep function in our understanding of the origins of our local environment, the solar\nsystem. In the world of application satellites, a new global navigation satellite system\ncalled Galileo should become operational, also around 2014. This is a civil programme,\nfunded by the European Union, involving the launch of a constellation of 30 satellites\nin Earth orbits at a height of around 23 000 km. It is hoped that the introduction of this\nnon-military system will remove the reticence of civilian organisations to embrace the\ntechnology of satellite navigation in their operations. One significant development arising\nfrom this is the prospect of satellite navigation being fully utilized in the arena of civil\nair traffic control.\n\nThis fourth edition of Spacecraft Systems Engineering has been significantly revised and\nupdated throughout, so that readers can master the many facets involved in an unmanned\nspace vehicle project, like those mentioned above, from early system design through to\nin-orbit flight operations. There are also some \u2018all-new\u2019 features which are worthy of\nadditional mention. Current trends in interplanetary missions have suggested that a new\nsection on low-thrust trajectories would be helpful, and this has been added to the already-\nextensive Mission Analysis chapter (Chapter 5). The previous Chapter 14 on Ground\nStations has been rewritten. The new version has been entitled \u2018Ground Segment\u2019 to\nemphasize that this area is not just about ground station aspects, but also includes many\nother activities such as flight operations. A new chapter (Chapter 17) has been added\ndevoted to the important topic of Assembly, Integration and Verification, which focuses\non the later stages of a spacecraft project when the whole system is brought together\nand tested prior to launch. The old chapter on Product Assurance has been completely\nrewritten (Chapter 19) to reflect the diverse aspects of PA, including that of software. This\nis particularly pertinent in the space sector, in which the manufactured \u2018products\u2019 often\nmust survive many years in a hostile environment without the benefit of maintenance.\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION xvii\n\nThe final chapter on Spacecraft System Engineering (Chapter 20) has also been rewritten,\nchanging the emphasis to discuss system design methods\u2014in particular that of concurrent\nengineering design. System design in action is illustrated by discussion of the design\ndevelopment of the ESA Cryosat spacecraft, which is used as a case study.\n\nFinally, the editors wish to thank the army of contributors who have given their time\nand effort to bring this edition to fruition\u2014without them a new edition would not have\nbeen possible. We are also indebted to the team at Wiley, in particular to Nicky Skinner\nand Gill Whitley, whose assistance throughout the period of compilation of the manuscript\nwas invaluable. As this stage was drawing to a close, and the production process was\nbeginning, we were shocked and saddened by the sudden death of Nicky Skinner in March.\nMy regret is that our working relationship was conducted purely by email as is often the\ncase these days. Although I did not have an opportunity to meet up and consolidate\nthat relationship, nevertheless I feel I got to know Nicky very well. I am thankful for\nher assistance throughout, and it is entirely appropriate that this edition is dedicated to\nher memory.\n\nGraham Swinerd\nSouthampton, March 2011\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE\nTHIRD EDITION\n\nGraham Swinerd, my friend and colleague, took over the running of the Space Technology\nshort courses at Southampton University when I retired in 1989. Who would be a better\nchoice than Graham to take over the role of principal editor for this new edition of\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering? I am sure that Graham will build on the reputation that\nthe past editions have achieved, and I wish him success in his new role. Over to you,\nGraham. . .\n\nPeter Fortescue, Southampton, July 2002\n\nSince the publication of the previous edition, Dan Goldin\u2019s \u2018Faster, Better, Cheaper\u2019 space\nmission philosophy has had a major impact upon American activities. As a consequence,\nthe last of the heavyweight interplanetary spacecraft, Cassini, was launched in October\n1997 on its mission to Saturn. Programmes such as NEAR Shoemaker, which launched\na relatively small but capable spacecraft in February 1996 to orbit and ultimately to land\non a small body\u2014the asteroid 433 Eros\u2014have substituted this type of mission. These\n\u2018small missions\u2019 have significantly influenced current and proposed planetary exploration\nprogrammes.\n\nIn the same interim period, we have also seen the launch of constellations into low\nEarth orbit, for global mobile communications using handheld telephones\u2014in particular,\nthe Iridium constellation, the first satellites of which were lofted in May 1997. Although\nfinancial problems have impacted this programme, it nevertheless heralds large-scale use\nof constellation systems in many application areas. There are great benefits to the usage\nof these distributed systems, not only in communications and navigation applications but\nalso in improving the temporal coverage of Earth observation. There is also an implicit\ntrend here to use a number of small, but capable, spacecraft to do the job of one or two\nlarge satellites.\n\nThe principal driver for the development of small satellite technology is the reduction\nin cost associated with access to space. The elements contributing to this philosophy are\nlow launch costs, a short design, build and test period, a less complex ground interface\nand operations, and the recognition of a means of testing new spacecraft technologies in\na relatively low financial risk environment.\n\nAt the other end of the size spectrum, December 1998 saw the first elements of the\nInternational Space Station (ISS) being brought together in orbit. If development continues\n\n\n\nxx PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\n\nas originally planned, around 2005, the ISS will become the largest structure (?400\ntonnes) ever to be deployed in Earth orbit, marking the beginning of permanent habitation\nin space.\n\nThese various developments have had a significant influence on the structure of the new\nedition of the book. The major changes involve the removal of the chapter on atmospheric\nre-entry, and the addition of a new chapter on small satellite engineering and applications.\nMuch of the removed material has been redistributed in other chapters, however, for\nexample, Earth atmosphere re-entry is included in Chapter 7 (Launch Vehicles), and\nsections on aero-manoeuvring have been included in Chapter 5 (Mission Analysis). The\nnew Chapter 18 on Small Satellites has been contributed by Martin Sweeting and Craig\nUnderwood of the Surrey Space Centre, based at the University of Surrey, UK. Both\nindividuals are recognized internationally for their expertise in this field. The chapter,\nbuilt on the huge expertise of the Surrey Space Centre, gives insights into small satellite\nsystems engineering in general. Given the growing activity in this area, no textbook of\nthis kind is complete without such a contribution.\n\nOther chapters have been rewritten\u2014in particular, Chapter 8 (Spacecraft Structures),\nChapter 11 (Thermal Control), Chapter 16 (Electromagnetic Compatibility) and\nChapter 19 (Spacecraft Systems Engineering)\u2014and most of the others have been\nsubstantially revised, including a discussion of constellation design and small-body\nmissions in Chapter 5 (Mission Analysis).\n\nSome of the authors of the second edition have retired, and new names have appeared\nin the contributors list. The editors are grateful to all of them for their contributions. It is\nalso sad to report that three of our previous authors have died in the interim\u2014Howard\nSmith (Telecommunications), Les Woolliscroft (Spacecraft Electromagnetic Compatibility\nEngineering) and Mervyn Briscoe (Spacecraft Mechanisms). Each of them will be sadly\nmissed.\n\nThe reader may have noticed the dedication at the front of the book to one of these\nauthors, Mervyn Briscoe, who was actively involved in revising his chapter on Mecha-\nnisms when he died in 2001. Our thanks are also due to Guglielmo Aglietti who jumped\ninto the hot seat to complete the revision of Mervyn\u2019s chapter as a co-author. Mervyn\ngave loyal service as a contributor to the short course activity at Southampton over many\nyears, and we would like to acknowledge this by dedicating this edition to his memory.\n\nFinally, it is appropriate to thank both Peter Fortescue and John Stark for their pio-\nneering work in bringing the previous editions to fruition, and for their valued assistance\nwith this one.\n\nGraham Swinerd\nSouthampton, July 2002\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE\nSECOND EDITION\n\nThis second edition comes in response to a phone call that we editors had been dreading.\n\u2018Had we thought of producing a second edition?\u2019 After much consideration our answer\nwas \u2018Yes\u2019, and here it is.\n\nNot only has it given our contributing authors a chance to update the material in their\nchapters\u2014the technology is developing all the time and five years is a long time! It\nhas also given us the opportunity to rectify some of the errors in the first edition (and\npossibly to introduce some new ones), and to respond to suggestions from readers about\nthe content and to our inevitable \u2018second thoughts\u2019 on the matter. As a result there are\ntwo new chapters.\n\nThe first is on Mechanisms\u2014important equipment on spacecraft. They are an essential\npart of many of the systems that are covered in the other chapters, but having their own\nrequirements we have given them chapter status here. They are a specialist topic, involving\nthe problem of moving one mechanical part relative to another. For an application that has\na long life, no servicing, no disturbance to the structure, and ideally no single point failure\nas design objectives, mechanism designers are faced with a challenging task. Chapter 16\ntells us how they have responded to it.\n\nThe second additional chapter addresses the subject of System Engineering. The first\nedition has no hyphens in its title. Those who read the title as meaning \u2018The Engineering\nof Spacecraft Systems\u2019 will probably have found that the content was much as they had\nexpected. Indeed there have been enough satisfied readers to cause the dreaded question\nof a second edition to be raised. However, it could also be read as meaning \u2018Systems\nEngineering of Spacecraft\u2019, and those who interpreted it as such will no doubt have been\ndisappointed to have found little on the discipline of System Engineering in the book.\n\nSo our response is to retain the same ambiguous title, and to retain the same thrust\nas in the first edition. But we have added a new chapter (No. 19), which focuses on the\nsubject of Systems Engineering of spacecraft. It is written by authors within the spacecraft\nindustry who have experience in that activity. We hope it will bring together the pieces\nof the jigsaw puzzle that are to be found among the other chapters, and will show how\nthey can be fitted together harmoniously to form a viable whole\u2014a spacecraft that meets\nits design objectives in a viable manner.\n\nSince the first edition some of our authors have moved to new locations; some have\nretired. New names have appeared in our list of contributors. We editors are grateful to\nthem all\u2014new and old\u2014and trust that this edition presents \u2018second thoughts\u2019 that are\nan improvement on the first.\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE\nFIRST EDITION\n\nThis book has grown out of a set of course notes, which accompany a series of short\ncourses given at Southampton University. These courses started in 1974 with a two\nweek \u2018space technology\u2019 course, and they are aimed at the recent science or engineering\ngraduate who wishes to become a spacecraft engineer. The courses are still thriving, now\nserving much of European industry, with one-week versions for experienced engineers,\nsometimes senior ones, who are specialists in their own fields.\n\nOn the courses, the attendees work in competing teams on a project that involves design-\ning a spacecraft in response to an overall objective. Over the years, mission designs\nhave been directed at all application areas: science, astronomy, communications and\nEarth observations. There is now a \u2018museum\u2019 of models that demonstrate vehicle lay-\nouts and support the attendees\u2019 presentations covering operation, subsystem specification\nand launch constraints. These models demonstrate system viability rather than detailed\ndesign. The projects are designed at \u2018system level\u2019, and their supervision has provided a\nbasis for deciding the level of detail that should be included in this book.\n\nThe coverage in this book is therefore aimed at giving the breadth that is needed by\nsystem engineers, with an emphasis on the bus aspect rather than on the payload. The\nspecialist engineer is well served with textbooks, which cover many of the subsystems\nin detail and in depth. He is unlikely to learn very much about his own specialist topic\nfrom this book. But he may well learn something about other specialists\u2019 disciplines, and,\nit is hoped, enough for him to appreciate the trade-offs that affect his own subsystem in\nrelation to others.\n\nChapters 2 to 5 set the general scene for spacecraft, and particularly for satellites. They\nmust operate in an environment that is generally hostile compared to that with which we\nare familiar on Earth, and the main features of this are described in Chapter 2. Chapters 3\nand 4 address the dynamics of objects in space, where the vehicles will respond to forces\nand moments that are minute, and which would be discounted as of no significance if\nthey occurred on Earth. Indeed, most of them do occur here, but we do not often operate\nin a fully free state, and our Earth-bound vehicles are subject to other, much larger forces.\n\nChapter 5 relates the motion of the spacecraft to Earth rather than to the inertially based\nreference system of celestial mechanics.\n\nChapters 6 to 15 address the main subsystems. Chapters 7 and 8 cover the subjects\nof getting off the ground and returning through the atmosphere. Chapters 6, 9 to 12 and\n14 deal with the main subsystems on board the spacecraft, that include the on-board end\nof the telemetry and control link (Chapter 14) with ground control (Chapter 15). The\ncommunication link is covered in Chapter 13 in which the fundamentals of the subject\n\n\n\nxxiv PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\n\nare included together with their rather special application to spacecraft. This is relevant\nto the telemetry and control link and to a communications payload.\n\nChapter 16 introduces electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), one of the subjects that\nmust be addressed by the systems engineer if the various subsystems are to work in\nharmony. Product assurance is of vital concern to spacecraft engineers. Their product(s)\nmust survive a hostile launch environment and then must last many years without the\nluxury of any maintenance. It does great credit to the discipline they exercise, that so\nmany of their products do so.\n\nWe editors would like to express our thanks to the authors who have contributed\nchapters in the book. Most of them have lectured on the courses mentioned above. Our\ntask has been to whittle down the material they have provided since they have been very\ngenerous. We are grateful too for their patience. The conversion of course notes into a\nbook was expected to be a short process. How wrong we were!\n\nWe would also like to thank colleagues Graham Swinerd and Adrian Tatnall, who read\nsome of the texts and gave advice. And finally our thanks to Sally Mulford, who has\nconverted some much-abused text into typescript with patience and good humour.\n\n\n\nLIST OF ACRONYMS\n\nAATSR Advanced Along-Track\nScanning Radiometer\n\nABM Apogee Boost Motor\nAC Alternating current\nACS Attitude Control System\nACU Antenna Control Unit\nA/D Analogue to digital\nADEOS Advanced Earth Observing\n\nSystem\nADR Active Debris Removal\nAFT Abbreviated Functional Test\nAGC Automatic gain control\nAIT Assembly, integration and\n\ntest\nAIV Assembly, integration and\n\nverification\nAKM Apogee Kick Motor\nAM Amplitude modulation\nAMI Active Microwave\n\nInstrument\nAMOOS Aero-Manoeuvring\n\nOrbit-to-Orbit Shuttle\nAO Announcement of\n\nOpportunity\nAOCS Attitude and Orbit Control\n\nSystem\nAOP Announcement of\n\nOpportunity Package\nAOS Acquisition of signal, also\n\nAdvanced Orbiting\nSystems\n\nAOTV Aero-assisted Orbital\nTransfer Vehicle\n\nAPM Antenna Pointing\nMechanism, also\nAttached Pressurized\nModule\n\nAPS Active Pixel Sensor\n\nAQAP Allied Quality Assurance\nPublication\n\nARQ Automatic report queuing\nASAP Ariane Structure for\n\nAuxiliary Payloads\nASAR Advanced Synthetic\n\nAperture Radar\nASIC Application-specific\n\nintegrated circuit\nASK Amplitude-shift keying\nASS Antenna Support Structure\nASW Address and\n\nsynchronization word\nATCS Active Thermal Control\n\nSystem\nATSR Along-track Scanning\n\nRadiometer\nAU Astronomical Unit (mean\n\ndistance from Earth to\nSun)\n\nBCDT Binary code data transfer\nBCH Bose-Chaudhuri-\n\nHocquenchem\nBCR Battery Charge Regulator\nBDR Battery Discharge\n\nRegulator\nBER Bit error rate\nBMDO Ballistic Missile Defence\n\nOrganization\nBMU Battery Management Unit\nBOL Beginning of life\nBPF Band-pass filter\nBPSK Bi-phase-shift keying\nBRTS Bilateration Ranging\n\nTransponder System\nBSF Back-Surface Field\nBSR Back-Surface Reflector\nCA Contingency Analysis\n\n\n\nxxvi LIST OF ACRONYMS\n\nCAD Computer Aided Design\nCADU Channel Access Data Unit\nCAM Civil, Aircraft, Military\nCCB Configuration Control\n\nBoard\nCCD Charge coupled device\nCCIR Comite?

W. Stark1, Graham G. Swinerd2 and Adrian R. L.\n\nTatnall2\n\n1School of Engineering and Material Science, Queen Mary, University of London\n2Aeronautics and Astronautics, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment,\nUniversity of Southampton\n\nMan has only had the ability to operate spacecraft successfully since 1957, when the\nRussian satellite Sputnik I was launched into orbit. At the time of writing (2010) the\nSpace Age is just over half a century old. In that time technology has made great strides,\nand the Apollo human expedition to the Moon and back is now a rather distant memory.\nIn little more than five decades, unmanned explorer spacecraft have flown past all the\nmajor bodies of the Solar System, apart from the \u2018dwarf planet\u2019 Pluto\u2014this exception will\nsoon be remedied, however, by the \u2018New Horizons\u2019 spacecraft that is due to fly through\nthe Pluto-Charon system in 2015. Space vehicles have landed on the Moon and Venus,\nand in recent years Mars has seen a veritable armada of orbiters, landers and rovers in\npreparation for a hoped-for future human expedition to the red planet. The Galileo Jupiter\norbiter successfully deployed a probe in 1995, which \u2018landed\u2019 on the gaseous \u2018surface\u2019\nof Jupiter. The Cassini/Huygens spacecraft has been a stunning success, entering orbit\naround Saturn in 2004, and executing a perfect landing on Titan of the European built\nHuygens probe in 2005. Minor bodies in the Solar System have also received the attention\nof mission planners. The first landing on such a body was executed by the Near Earth\nAsteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Shoemaker spacecraft, when it touched down on the Eros\nasteroid in February 2001. This was succeeded in 2005 by the attempted sampling of\nmaterial from the Itokawa asteroid by the Japanese Hayabusa spacecraft. Although the\nsampling operation was unsuccessful, the spacecraft is now on a return journey to Earth\nin the hope that some remnants of asteroid material may be found in its sealed sampling\nchamber. Similarly, a prime objective of the ambitious European Rosetta programme is\nto place a lander on a cometary body in 2014. There is also a growing awareness of the\nimpact threat posed by near-Earth asteroids and comets, which is driving research into\neffective means of diverting such a body from a collision course with Earth.\n\nSince our brief sojourn to the Moon in 1969\u20131972, human spaceflight has been confined\nto Earth orbit, with the current focus on construction and utilization of the International\nSpace Station (ISS). The United States, Europe, Russia and Japan are all involved in this\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W. Stark.\n\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n2 INTRODUCTION\n\nambitious long-term programme. The ISS has been a major step for both the technology\nand politics of the space industry, and has been a useful exercise in learning to live and\nwork in space\u2014a necessary lesson for future human exploration of the Solar System. The\n\u2018work horse\u2019 of this activity has been the US Space Shuttle, which has been the United\nStates\u2019 principal means of human access to orbit over almost three decades. However,\n2011 sees the retirement of the Shuttle. This is a major event in NASA\u2019s space operations,\nand it has forced a radical rethink of the United States\u2019 human spaceflight programme.\nThis led to the proposal of a less complex man-rated launch vehicle, Ares 1, which is\npart of the Constellation Programme. The objective of this programme is to produce a\nnew human spaceflight infrastructure to allow a return of US astronauts to the Moon, and\nultimately to Mars. However, the shuttle retirement coincides with a deep global financial\nrecession, and the political commitment to the Constellation Programme appears to be\nvery uncertain. This re-evaluation by the US will perhaps herald the reinvigoration of the\ndrive towards the full commercialization of the space infrastructure.\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that the development of unmanned application spacecraft\nwill continue unabated. Many countries now have the capability of putting spacecraft into\norbit. Satellites have established a firm foothold as part of the infrastructure that underpins\nour technological society here on Earth. There is every expectation that they have much\nmore to offer in the future.\n\nBefore the twentieth century, space travel was largely a flight of fantasy. Most authors\nduring that time failed to understand the nature of a spacecraft\u2019s motion, and this resulted\nin the idea of \u2018lighter-than-air\u2019 travel for most would-be space-farers [1, 2]. At the turn of\nthe twentieth century, however, a Russian teacher, K. E. Tsiolkovsky, laid the foundation\nstone for rocketry by providing insight into the nature of propulsive motion. In 1903, he\npublished a paper in the Moscow Technical Review deriving what we now term the rocket\nequation, or Tsiolkovsky\u2019s equation (equation 3.20). Owing to the small circulation of\nthis journal, the results of his work were largely unknown in the West prior to the work\nof Hermann Oberth, which was published in 1923.\n\nThese analyses provided an understanding of propulsive requirements, but they did not\nprovide the technology. This eventually came, following work by R. H. Goddard in Amer-\nica and Wernher von Braun in Germany. The Germans demonstrated their achievements\nwith the V-2 rocket, which they used towards the end of World War II. Their rockets\nwere the first reliable propulsive systems, and while they were not capable of placing a\nvehicle into orbit, they could deliver a warhead of approximately 1000 kg over a range\nof 300 km. It was largely the work of these same German engineers that led to the first\nsuccessful flight of Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957, closely followed by the first American\nsatellite, Explorer 1, on 31 January 1958.\n\nFive decades have seen major advances in space technology. It has not always been\nsmooth, as evidenced by the major impact that the Challenger (1986) and Columbia\n(2003) disasters had on the American space programme. Technological advances in\nmany areas have, however, been achieved. Particularly notable are the developments\nin energy-conversion technologies, especially solar photovoltaics, fuel cells and batter-\nies. Developments in heat-pipe technology have also occurred in the space arena, with\nground-based application in the oil industry. Perhaps the most notable developments in this\nperiod, however, have been in electronic computers and software. Although these have\nnot necessarily been driven by space technology, the new capabilities that they afford\nhave been rapidly assimilated, and they have revolutionized the flexibility of spacecraft.\nIn some cases they have even turned a potential mission failure into a grand success.\n\n\n\nPAYLOADS AND MISSIONS 1.1 3\n\nBut the spacecraft has also presented a challenge to Man\u2019s ingenuity and understanding.\nEven something as fundamental as the unconstrained rotational motion of a body is\nnow better understood as a consequence of placing a spacecraft\u2019s dynamics under close\nscrutiny. Man has been successful in devising designs for spacecraft that will withstand\na hostile space environment, and he has found many solutions.\n\n1.1 PAYLOADS AND MISSIONS\n\nPayloads and missions for spacecraft are many and varied. Some have reached the stage of\nbeing economically viable, such as satellites for communications, weather and navigation\npurposes. Others monitor Earth for its resources, the health of its crops and pollution.\nDetermination of the extent and nature of global warming is only possible using the\nglobal perspective provided by satellites. Other satellites serve the scientific community\nof today and perhaps the layman of tomorrow by adding to Man\u2019s knowledge of the\nEarth\u2019s environment, the solar system and the universe.\n\nEach of these peaceful applications is paralleled by inevitable military ones. By means\nof global observations, the old \u2018superpowers\u2019 acquired knowledge of military activities on\nthe surface of the planet and the deployment of aircraft. Communication satellites serve the\nmilitary user, as do weather satellites. The Global Positioning System (GPS) navigational\nsatellite constellation is now able to provide an infantryman, sailor or fighter pilot with\nhis location to an accuracy of about a metre. These \u2018high ground\u2019 space technologies have\nbecome an integral part of military activity in the most recent terrestrial conflicts.\n\nTable 1.1 presents a list of payloads/missions with an attempt at placing them into\ncategories based upon the types of trajectory they may follow. The satellites may be\ncategorized in a number of ways such as by orbit altitude, eccentricity or inclination.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific orbit adopted for a mission will have a strong\nimpact on the design of the vehicle, as illustrated in the following paragraphs.\n\nTable 1.1 Payload/mission types\n\nMission Trajectory type\n\nCommunications Geostationary for low latitudes, Molniya and Tundra for\nhigh latitudes (mainly Russian), Constellations of\npolar LEO satellites for global coverage\n\nEarth resources Polar LEO for global coverage\nWeather Polar LEO, or geostationary\nNavigation Inclined MEO for global coverage\nAstronomy LEO, HEO, GEO and \u2018orbits\u2019 around Lagrange points\nSpace environment Various, including HEO\nMilitary Polar LEO for global coverage, but various\nSpace stations LEO\nTechnology\n\ndemonstration\nVarious\n\nNote: GEO: Geostationary Earth orbit; HEO: Highly elliptical orbit; LEO: Low Earth Orbit; MEO:\nMedium height Earth Orbit.\n\n\n\n4 INTRODUCTION\n\nConsider geostationary (GEO) missions; these are characterized by the vehicle having a\nfixed position relative to the features of the Earth. The propulsive requirement to achieve\nsuch an orbit is large, and thus the \u2018dry mass\u2019 (exclusive of propellant) is a modest\nfraction of the all-up \u2018wet mass\u2019 of the vehicle. With the cost per kilogram-in-orbit\nbeing as high as it currently is\u2014of the order of $30 000 per kilogram in geostationary\norbit\u2014it usually becomes necessary to optimize the design to achieve minimum mass,\nand this leads to a large number of vehicle designs, each suitable only for a narrow\nrange of payloads and missions.\n\nConsidering the communication between the vehicle and the ground, it is evident that\nthe large distance involved means that the received power is many orders of magnitude\nless than the transmitted power. The vehicle is continuously visible at its ground control\nstation, and this enables its health to be monitored continuously and reduces the need for\nit to be autonomous or to have a complex data handling/storage system.\n\nLow Earth orbit (LEO) missions are altogether different. Communication with such\ncraft is more complex as a result of the intermittent nature of ground station passes.\nThis resulted in the development, in the early 1980s, of a new type of spacecraft\u2014the\ntracking and data relay satellite system (TDRSS)\u2014operating in GEO to provide a link\nbetween craft in LEO and a ground centre. This development was particularly important\nbecause the Shuttle in LEO required a continuous link with the ground. More generally,\nthe proximity of LEO satellites to the ground does make them an attractive solution\nfor the provision of mobile communications. The power can be reduced and the time\ndelay caused by the finite speed of electromagnetic radiation does not produce the latency\nproblems encountered using a geostationary satellite.\n\nThe power subsystem is also notably different when comparing LEO and GEO satellites.\nA dominant feature is the relative period spent in sunlight and eclipse in these orbits. LEO\nis characterized by a high fraction of the orbit being spent in eclipse, and hence a need for\nsubstantial oversizing of the solar array to meet battery-charging requirements. In GEO,\non the other hand, a long time (up to 72 min) spent in eclipse at certain times of the year\nleads to deep discharge requirements on the battery, although the eclipse itself is only a\nsmall fraction of the total orbit period. Additional differences in the power system are\nalso partly due to the changing solar aspect angle to the orbit plane during the course\nof the year. This may be offset, however, in the case of the sun-synchronous orbit (see\nSection 5.4 of Chapter 5), which maintains a near-constant aspect angle\u2014this is not\nnormally done for the benefit of the spacecraft bus designer, but rather because it enables\ninstruments viewing the ground to make measurements at the same local time each day.\n\nIt soon becomes clear that changes of mission parameters of almost any type have\npotentially large effects upon the specifications for the subsystems that comprise and\nsupport a spacecraft.\n\n1.2 A SYSTEM VIEW OF SPACECRAFT\n\nThis book is concerned with spacecraft systems. The variety of types and shapes of these\nsystems is extremely wide. When considering spacecraft, it is convenient to subdivide\nthem into functional elements or subsystems. But it is also important to recognize that\nthe satellite itself is only an element within a larger system. There must be a supporting\nground control system (Figure 1.1) that enables commands to be sent up to the vehicle and\nstatus and payload information to be returned to the ground. There must also be a launcher\n\n\n\nA SYSTEM VIEW OF SPACECRAFT 1.2 5\n\nsystem that sets the vehicle on its way to its final orbit. Each of the elements of the overall\nsystem must interact with the other elements, and it is the job of the system designer to\nachieve an overall optimum in which the mission objectives are realized efficiently. It\nis, for example, usual for the final orbit of a geostationary satellite to be achieved by a\ncombination of a launch vehicle and the boost motor of the satellite itself.\n\nThis starts us towards the overall process of systems engineering, which will be treated\nin detail in the final chapter of this book. Figure 1.1 shows the breakdown of the elements\nneeded to form a satellite mission. Each of these may be considered to perform func-\ntions that will have functional requirements associated with them. We can thus have an\noverriding set of mission requirements that will arise from the objectives of the mission\nitself. In the process of systems engineering, we are addressing the way in which these\nfunctional requirements can best be met, in a methodical manner.\n\nChambers Science and Technology Dictionary provides the following very apt definition\nof the term \u2018system engineering\u2019 as used in the space field:\n\n\u2018A logical process of activities that transforms a set of requirements arising from\na specific mission objective into a full description of a system which fulfils the\nobjective in an optimum way. It ensures that all aspects of a project have been\nconsidered and integrated into a consistent whole.\u2019\n\nThe \u2018system\u2019 in question here could comprise all the elements within both the space and\nthe ground segments of a spacecraft project, including the interfaces between the major\nelements, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Alternatively, the system approach could be applied\non a more limited basis to an assembly within the space segment, such as an instrument\nwithin the payload. In the case of an instrument, the system breakdown would include\nantenna elements or optics and detectors as appropriate, and the instrument\u2019s mechanical\nand electrical subsystems.\n\nThe mission objectives are imposed on the system by the customer, or user of the\ndata. They are statements of the aims of the mission, are qualitative in nature and should\n\nSatellite\n\nLauncher\n\nGround station\n\nFigure 1.1 The total system\u2014the combined space and ground segments\n\n\n\n6 INTRODUCTION\n\nbe general enough to remain virtually unchanged during the design process. It is these\nfundamental objectives that must be fulfilled as the design evolves.\n\nFor example, the mission objectives might be to provide secure and robust three-\ndimensional position and velocity determination to surface and airborne military users.\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a method adopted to meet these objectives.\n\nAn illustration of the range of methods and the subsequent requirements that can stem\nfrom mission objectives is given by the large number of different concepts that have been\nproposed to meet the objective of providing a worldwide mobile communication system.\nThey range from an extension of the existing Inmarsat spacecraft system to schemes\nusing highly eccentric and tundra orbits (see Chapter 5 for the definitions of these), to a\nvariety of concepts based around a network of LEO satellites, such as The Globalstar or\nIridium constellations.\n\nThis example demonstrates an underlying principle of system engineering, that is, that\nthere is never only one solution to meet the objectives. There will be a diverse range of\nsolutions, some better and some worse, based on an objective discriminating parameter\nsuch as cost, mass or some measure of system performance. The problem for the system\nengineer is to balance all these disparate assessments into a single solution.\n\nThe process that the system engineer first undertakes is to define, as a result of the\nmission objectives, the mission requirements. The subsequent requirements on the system\nand subsystems evolve from these initial objectives through the design process. This is\nillustrated in Figure 1.2, which shows how a hierarchy of requirements is established.\nIn Chapter 20 this hierarchy is further explained and illustrated by considering a number\n\nMission requirements\nPerformance Reliability\nCoverage Cost\n\nLifetime\n\nSpacecraft system\nrequirements\n\nOrbit Power\nConfiguration Mass \n\nOperation\n\nSubsystem requirements\nThermal Power Communications\nStructure Electronics Attitude control\n\nGround segment\nGround station\n\nData processing \n\nLaunch vehicle \nVolume\n\nEnvironment\nMass distribution \n\nMission objectives\nUser requirements\nPolitical constraints \nFinancial constraints\n\nFigure 1.2 Objectives and requirements of a spacecraft mission\n\n\n\nA SYSTEM VIEW OF SPACECRAFT 1.2 7\n\nof specific spacecraft in detail. At this point, however, it is important to note the\ndouble-headed arrows in Figure 1.2. These indicate the feedback and iterative nature of\nsystem engineering.\n\nWe turn now to the spacecraft system itself. This may be divided conveniently into\ntwo principal elements, the payload and the bus (or service module). It is of course the\npayload that is the motivation for the mission itself. In order that this may function it\nrequires certain resources that will be provided by the bus. In particular, it is possible to\nidentify the functional requirements, which include:\n\n1. The payload must be pointed in the correct direction.\n2. The payload must be operable.\n3. The data from the payload must be communicated to the ground.\n4. The desired orbit for the mission must be maintained.\n5. The payload must be held together, and on to the platform on which it is mounted.\n6. The payload must operate and be reliable over some specified period.\n7. An energy source must be provided to enable the above functions to be performed.\n\nThese requirements lead on to the breakdown into subsystems, which is shown in\nFigure 1.3. Inset in each of these is a number that relates it to the functions above.\n\nThe structure of this book recognizes this overall functional breakdown, shown in\nFigure 1.3. The individual subsystems are covered separately in the chapters. Thus, in\nChapter 8 the structural subsystem is considered, and in Chapter 15, mechanism design is\noutlined. The power subsystem, including the various ways in which power can be raised\non a spacecraft, is described in Chapter 10. The main elements of an attitude control\nsubsystem are indicated principally in Chapter 9, although the underlying attitude motion\nof a free body such as a satellite is covered in Chapter 3. Telemetry and command subsys-\ntems may be conveniently considered alongside on-board data handling (OBDH); these\n\nSpace segment\n\nPayload Bus\n\nStructure (5) Attitude and\norbit control\n(1) and (4)\n\nThermal\n(1) and (6)\n\nPropulsion\n(1) and (4)\n\nPower\n(7)\n\nTelemetry (2)\nand command (3)\n\nData handling\n(2)\n\nMechanisms\n(5)\n\nFigure 1.3 Spacecraft subsystems\n\n\n\n8 INTRODUCTION\n\ntopics are covered in Chapter 13, with the underlying principles and practice of space-\ncraft communications in the previous chapter. The thermal control subsystem appears in\nChapter 11. Propulsion, as it relates to on-board systems, is described in Chapter 6, while\nits application to launch systems is described in Chapter 7.\n\nOne facet of these subsystems is that the design of any one has impacts and resource\nimplications on the others. A most important feature of spacecraft system design is to\nidentify what aspects of the mission and what elements of the design provide the major\ninfluences on the type of satellite that may meet the specific mission requirements. This\nprocess is the identification of the \u2018design drivers\u2019 . In some cases the drivers will affect\nmajor features of the spacecraft hardware. The varied mission requirements, coupled with\nthe need to minimize mass and hence power, has thus led to a wide variety of individual\ndesign solutions being realized. However, the spacecraft industry is now evolving towards\ngreater standardization\u2014in the shape of the specific buses that may be used to provide\nthe resources for a variety of missions (e.g., the SPOT bus, the Eurostar bus, Mars/Venus\nExpress, etc.\u2014see Chapter 20).\n\nIt is not simply the nature of its payload that determines the design that is selected for a\ngiven mission, although this will have a considerable influence. Commercial and political\ninfluences are strongly felt in spacecraft engineering. Individual companies have special-\nist expertise; system engineering is dependent on the individual experience within this\nexpertise. This was perhaps most notably demonstrated by the Hughes Company, which\nadvanced the art of the spin-stabilized satellite through a series of Intelsat spacecraft.\nSpacecraft systems engineering is not all science\u2014there is indeed an art to the discipline.\n\nThis leads to another major feature of spacecraft system design, namely, the impact\nof reliability. The majority of terrestrial systems may be maintained, and their reliability,\nwhile being important, is not generally critical to their survival. If a major component\nfails, the maintenance team can be called in. In space, this luxury is not afforded and while\nthe Shuttle did provide in-orbit servicing for a limited number of satellites, this was an\nextremely expensive option. This requires that the system must be fault-tolerant, and when\nthis tolerance is exceeded the system is no longer operable and the mission has ended.\n\nThere are two principal methods used to obtain high reliability. The first is to use a\ndesign that is well proven. This is true for both system and component selection.\n\nThe requirement to validate the environmental compatibility of components (Chapter 2)\nleads to relatively old types being used in mature technology, especially in electronic\ncomponents. This tends to lead to a greater demand for power than the terrestrial\n\u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 technology. At system level a \u2018tried and tested\u2019 solution will minimize\ndevelopment risk, reducing system cost while also achieving high reliability.\n\nThe second method of achieving high reliability is via de-rating (Chapter 19). By reduc-\ning the power of the many electronic components, for example, a greater life expectancy\ncan be obtained. This leads to an overall increase in mass.\n\nThe net effect of designing for high reliability is that spacecraft design is\nconservative\u2014\u2018if it has been done before then so much the better\u2019. Much of satellite\ndesign is thus not state-of-the-art technology. Design teams evolve a particular design\nsolution to meet varied missions\u2014because it is a design they understand\u2014and hence\nsystem design is an art as well as a science.\n\nIn making the selection of subsystems for the spacecraft, the designer must have a good\ngrasp of the way in which the subsystems work and the complex interactions between\nthem, and they must recognize how the craft fits into the larger system. Further, the\n\n\n\nTHE FUTURE 1.3 9\n\ndesigner must be able to trade off advantages in one area with the disadvantages in\nanother and achieve a balance in which the end result will work as a harmonious whole.\nWhile each subsystem will have its own performance criterion, its performance must\nnevertheless be subordinated to that of the system as a whole.\n\n1.3 THE FUTURE\n\nAs we enter the second half century of the Space Age, we are approaching a new frontier\nin space. Up until now, we have been able to gain access to space, and demonstrate a\ncompetent exploitation of this environment principally in terms of the use of application\nsatellites\u2014however, our utilization of it is still limited. This limitation is mainly related to\nthe very high cost of access to orbit, and this obstacle needs to be overcome in opening\nup the new frontier. Beyond the frontier, however, we will require to establish space\ninfrastructure; including the prime elements of communications, and safe and reliable\ntransportation, with a permanent human presence in space\u2014initially on space stations,\nbut then on the Moon and Mars. Over the last 40 years or so, space exploration has had\nto adapt to changes in world politics. Before that, in the Apollo era, the funding available\nwas motivated by a political end\u2014that of winning the \u2018space race\u2019 and so demonstrating\nthe superiority of one political ideology over another.\n\nClearly, to set up the infrastructure there must be a space transportation system.\nThe first step\u2014getting off the ground\u2014requires the development of next-generation\nlaunchers, which are truly reusable, having aircraft-like operational characteristics. This\nposes huge technological challenges principally for propulsion engineers and material sci-\nentists. However, the rewards for such a breakthrough would be enormous\u2014the resulting\nreduction in cost to access to orbit would open up the new frontier, not only in terms of\nspace applications and science, but also for human space exploration and space tourism.\n\nThe early part of the twenty-first century will see the completion and operation of\nthe ISS. Although this has been a controversial and expensive programme, it will no\ndoubt be superseded by future space stations, which will be used as staging posts, where\n\u2018a new team of horses\u2019 can be obtained. Surely such orbital staging posts will eventually\nbecome assembly and servicing posts as well, so that spacecraft venturing beyond Earth\norbit do not have to be designed to withstand the full rigours of launch, when their\nsubsequent stages of travel are relatively stress-free. Manufacturing in space also has\nsignificant potential, not only for exotic materials, but also for lightweight structural\nmaterials extruded in zero gravity, for use in zero gravity. A communications infrastructure\nis already in use. There will be a requirement for \u2018accommodation units\u2019 in orbit, fulfilling\nboth scientific and space tourism needs. This will be aided by the store of knowledge\nbeing gathered each year of Man\u2019s ability to live in space. There is a requirement for a\npower generating and supply system . . . and so the list goes on.\n\nWe are, however, at a crossroad in the way we develop our presence in space.\nThroughout the past 50 years there has been debate concerning the presence of humans\nin space: what role should we have and how should this be accomplished. Over the past\n30 years there has also been the parallel debate about how space endeavours should be\nfinanced\u2014whether by governmental funds or private capital. The philosophies of the\npast may of course reassert themselves, with the result that we see funding for space\nprogrammes once again dominated by tax payers money, but maybe not. This issue is\n\n\n\n10 INTRODUCTION\n\ncentral to the current controversy (of 2009/10) which has been stimulated by the Obama\nadministration and the Augustine Commission, resulting in the cancellation of the\nConstellation programme.\n\nThe issues are drawing together in a way never before witnessed. Up until very recently,\nthe advent of space tourism has only been the province of the dreamer and the science\nfiction aficionado. This is now changing, stimulated without doubt by the winning of\nthe Ansari X-prize in October 2004 by SpaceShipOne, built by the company Scaled\nComposites. Their subsequent teaming with Virgin Galactic in 2005 means that it is now\npossible (in 2010) to reserve a seat online on the first commercial sub-orbital flights.\nThere is, as a result, the potential for the commercial airline industry (which itself was\ninitiated by the not dissimilar Orteig Prize, won by Charles Lindbergh in 1927) to address\nthe issue of access to space. The enabling technologies are gradually emerging alongside\nthe commercial realization that some people can afford to fly into space at a commercial\nprice tag. This is all coming at a time when the prevailing political situation in the\nUSA is pointing to a reassessment of the role NASA should play in future access to\nspace. It seems quite probable that this nexus will indeed further stimulate the progress\nto the commercial utilization of space. There is a subtle but significant shift. Rather than\nattempting merely to commercialize the sale of a largely government-funded collection of\ndata products from satellites, typified by the approaches adopted in the 1980s and 90s, a\nmovement can be perceived towards the commercialization of the core process of access\nto space by individuals.\n\nThere is a whole new exciting arena waiting to be explored, occupied and used for the\nbenefit of all mankind.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] de Bergerac, Cyrano (1649) Voyage dans la lune.\n[2] Winter, F.

Stark\n\nSchool of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary, University of London\n\n2.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nSpacecraft operation is characterized by its remoteness from the Earth and thus the loss of\nthe Earth\u2019s protective shield, namely, the atmosphere. This atmosphere evidently provides\na suitable stable environment in which the human species has been able to evolve. Coupled\nwith the gravitational force of the Earth, \u2018the one-g environment\u2019, it provides familiarity\nin design, and its removal has significant and sometimes unexpected implications. The aim\nof this chapter is to introduce the reader to the nature of the spacecraft\u2019s environment and\nthe implications that it has on spacecraft design, by considering both the way materials\nbehave and the way in which systems as a whole are influenced. The final section looks\nvery briefly at the implications for human space flight.\n\nBefore considering the environment in detail it should be noted that the different phases\nin the life of a space vehicle, namely, manufacture, pre-launch, launch and finally space\noperation, all have their own distinctive features. Although a space vehicle spends the\nmajority of its life in space, it is evident that it must survive the other environments\nfor complete success. Whilst the manufacturing phase is not specifically identified in\nthe following section, it has an effect upon the reliability and the ability to meet design\ngoals. Cleanliness, humidity and codes of practice are critical in the success of spacecraft\nmissions, and these issues are addressed in Chapters 17 and 19.\n\n2.2 PRE-OPERATIONAL SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENTS\n\n2.2.1 Pre-launch environment\n\nThe design, manufacture and assembly of a large spacecraft, and its final integration\ninto a launch vehicle is a lengthy process, lasting typically 5\u201310 years.

Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n12 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\nsubsystems may be stored for months or even years prior to launch (e.g. the Galileo\nmission to Jupiter). Careful environmental control during such periods is essential if\ndegradation of the spacecraft system as a whole is to be avoided.\n\n2.2.2 The launch phase\n\nFrom an observer\u2019s viewpoint, the launch of a space vehicle is evidently associated with\ngross noise levels. This impinges on the structure of a satellite contained within the\nlauncher\u2019s shroud. The launch sequence entails high levels of vibration, associated both\nwith the noise field and structural vibration, modest-to-high levels of acceleration during\nascent, mechanical shock due to pyrotechnic device operation and stage separation, a\nthermal environment that differs from both laboratory and space environments, and for\nmost launch vehicles, a rapidly declining ambient pressure. These features are described\nseparately below.\n\nThe severe acoustic/vibration environment during launch is due to both the operation\nof the launch vehicle\u2019s main engines, and also the aerodynamic buffeting as the vehicle\nrises through the lower region of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Two peak levels occur.\n\nThe first peak occurs at the moment of lift-off. The overall build-up of the rocket motor\nfiring and the exhaust products reflected from the ground reaches a peak at launcher\nrelease. During ascent, the contribution from ground reflection decreases, but a variety\nof mechanical components, such as liquid fuel turbopump operation, continue to excite\nthe vehicle\u2019s structure. The vibration is not only directly transmitted to the spacecraft\nthrough structural components, but it also excites the launch shroud to generate a sec-\nondary acoustic field. For light, flexible components such as the solar array, the acoustic\nenvironment may be more severe than the mechanically induced vibration [1].\n\nThe second peak in the acoustic field occurs during transonic flight. The launch shroud\nis again excited, this time by the unsteady flow field around the vehicle.\n\nMeasurement of the field is generally made in dB with reference to a pressure of\n2 \u00d7 10?5 Pa. The sound pressure level I is then measured in decibels, given by\n\nI = 20 log10\n(\n\nF\n\n2 \u00d7 10?5\n)\n\ndB\n\nwhere F is the acoustic field intensity. The frequency spectrum of the noise field will\nbe dependent on the launch vehicle and will change during the launch sequence. Data\nis provided by the launch agency for design purposes, thus enabling the designer to\nquantify the vibrational inputs that individual components and the whole space vehicle\nwill experience. The design noise spectrum for Ariane 5 is compared with that of the\nnow decommissioned Ariane 4 in Figure 2.1 [2, 3]. The random vibration is indicated in\nFigure 2.2 for Ariane 4. Data for the Ariane 5 launch vehicle shows a similar trend, but\nwith the peak amplitude shifted to a lower frequency.\n\nThe steady component of launch acceleration must achieve a speed increase of about\n9.5 km/s. Its time history is again dependent on the launch vehicle used. Low-mass payload\nvehicles such as Scout, sounding rockets, and air-launched systems such as Pegasus gen-\nerally exhibit high peak acceleration, whereas those of large payload/crewed vehicles are\nsmaller. For multi-stage vehicles, the acceleration increases during the burn of each stage\nand peaks at burn-out/stage-separation. This is demonstrated for Ariane 5 in Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\nPRE-OPERATIONAL SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENTS 2.2 13\n\n140\n\ndB\n\n135\n\n130\n\n125\n\n120\n\n115\n\n110\n1025 5 5103 104 Hz101\n\nAriane 4\n\nAriane 5\n\n(1 kHz)\n\nIntegrated level 142 dB\nRef. 0 dB = 2 \u00d7 10?5 pascal\n\nFigure 2.1 Ariane noise spectrum under the SPELTRA fairing, Ariane 4 [2] and\nSPELTRA/Ariane 5 [3]. (Reproduced by permission of Arianespace)\n\nDuring this launch profile, event H1 is the solid rocket booster flame-out and separation,\nevent FJ is the fairing jettisoning, event H2 is the main cryogenic stage engine shutdown\nand separation and event H3 is the upper stage shutdown. The air-launched Pegasus, a\nthree-stage solid rocket vehicle, shows peak static acceleration at stage burnout, with the\nactual value being heavily dependent upon the payload mass. Thus for a 50 kg payload at\nstage 3 burn-out, the 3? acceleration is 13 g0 [4]. However, for the near maximum payload\nof 600 kg this falls to nearly 4.5 g0(g0 is the surface gravitational acceleration, 9.8 m/s2).\nTable 2.1 shows the design loads that a satellite must achieve associated with various\nmission events for the Ariane 5 launch vehicle (see also Section 8.4.2 for discussion of\nthe impacts of these launch loads on structural design).\n\nFor human flight, it is necessary to place the astronaut in a suitable position to\nwithstand peak acceleration levels; Figure 2.4 shows the typical maximum levels that\nmay be withstood. Greatest protection is provided when the astronaut is on his or her\nback during launch.\n\nMechanical shock is experienced when devices such as latches or explosive bolts\nare used, or at ignition of rocket motor stages and their subsequent separation, launch\nvehicle/payload separation, or when docking or landing.\n\nThese instantaneous events can provide extremely high-acceleration levels lasting\nonly a few milliseconds locally, or in some cases, extending to the complete system.\n\n\n\n14 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\n10?3\n101\n\n5\n\n10?2\n\n5\n\n10?1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n5 102 5 103 1045 Hz\n\ng2/Hz Spectral density\n\nr.m.s. acceleration 7.3g\n\n+6\n d\n\nB\n/o\n\nct\n.\n\n?3 dB/oct.\n\nFigure 2.2 Ariane 4 random vibration spectrum [3].

The temperature reached is determined by the specific heat of the shroud material\nand a balance between friction heating and radiative and convective heat losses. The sub-\nsequent temperature rise of the payload within the shroud is dominated by radiative and\nheat conduction paths between shroud and payload. Once the shroud has been jettisoned,\npayload heating arises directly as a result of frictional forces, but the low density of the\natmosphere then results in only modest heat fluxes.\n\nFigure 2.5 shows the heating experienced during the Ariane 5 launch ascent into geosta-\ntionary transfer orbit (GTO) [3]. The altitude at which the fairing is jettisoned is governed\nby an aerothermal flux limit which ensures that the launcher payload is not exposed to a\nlevel beyond 1135 W/m2 once the fairing has been ejected.\n\nThe ambient atmospheric pressure declines during launch. The rate at which depressur-\nization occurs depends on the venting of the shroud volume. Generally, this is fixed by the\ninclusion of venting ports; for example, on Ariane 5 the static pressure declines at a rate\nof 2 kPa/s although there is a brief period during ascent where this may reach 4.5 kPa/s.\nVenting control is particularly important because of possible adverse static loads being\nplaced on structural members. It should be noted that venting of electronic boxes is also\ngenerally required within the satellite payload.\n\nGreat care is required during payload integration to ensure that electromagnetic\ninterference (EMI) does not present a hazard. Hazards may present themselves in a\nvariety of forms but the most severe are cases in which EMI may result in the activation\nof part of the payload, which could lead to death of attendant personnel, perhaps via\nthe ignition of an on-board propulsion system. Figure 2.6 shows the EMI environment\nassociated with Ariane 5.\n\n\n\nOPERATIONAL SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENTS 2.3 17\n\n1E+04\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nE\n (\n\ndB\n?v\n\n / \nm\n\n)\n\n150\n\n200\n\n1E+05 1E+06 1E+07\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n1E+08 1E+09 1E+10 1E+11\n\n13,50 to 14,8 GHz\n5,925 to 7,075 GHz  \n2,025 to 2,11 GHz      \n\n1,00 to 1,50 GHz\n2,20 to 2,29 GHz\n2,90 to 3,40 GHz\n5,40 to 5,90 GHz\n\nFigure 2.6 Electromagnetic interference for Ariane 5 [3].

It is not surprising that it dominates\nthe space environment of the whole Solar System, and it is therefore appropriate to outline\nits significant features as they affect the near-Earth environment.\n\nThe Sun itself is not a particularly significant body in the universe. It is a star of mass\n?2 \u00d7 1030 kg, modest by stellar standards, and is one of ?1011 stars that form our galaxy.\nIt is classified as a G2V star, having a yellowish appearance because its radiated light\npeaks at ?460 nm, and it is termed a yellow-dwarf star . Its radius is 7 \u00d7 108 m.\n\nAfter the Sun, the nearest star is 3.5 light years away (1 light year = 9.46 \u00d7 1012 km)\nand between the stars the gas density is low, with hydrogen as the dominant species. The\ndensity amounts to only 3 atoms/cm3, in comparison to the nominal number density of\nour own atmosphere at sea level of ?3 \u00d7 1019 molecules/cm3.\n\nThe Sun is fundamentally a giant thermonuclear fusion reactor, the surface temperature\nof which is ?5800 K. The photosphere is optically thick, and its spectrum approximates\nto that of a black body.\n\nThe solar spectrum is shown in Figure 2.7, with a 5900 K black body for comparison.\nIt is evident that it departs from the black-body spectrum at some wavelengths, these\ndiscrepancies arising in the solar atmosphere. There are two primary regions of this. The\nlower, or chromosphere, extends to a few thousand kilometres above the photosphere\nand is a region of increasing temperature, peaking at ?10 000 K; it is responsible for\nenhanced ultraviolet (UV) emission. The upper atmosphere, called the corona , becomes\n\n\n\n18 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\n103\n\n10\n\n10?1\n\n10?3\n\n10?5\n\n10?7\n\n10?9\n\n10?11\n\n10?13\n\n10?15\n\n10?17\n\n10?19\n\n10?21\n\n10?23\n10?12 10?10 10?8 10?6 10?4 10?2 1\n\n1021 1019\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0\n\n1017 1015 1013 1011 109\nIn\n\nso\nla\n\ntio\nn \n\n(W\n m\n\n?2\n ?\n\nm\n?1\n\n)\n\nIn\nso\n\nla\ntio\n\nn \n(W\n\n/m\n2 \n\n?1\n)\n\nWavelength ?

Its nominal temperature is around\n2 \u00d7 106 K, and it emits substantial amounts of X-rays. The nominal release of energy\nfrom the Sun is at a rate of 3.85 \u00d7 1026 W. In order to gain an insight to this power\nlevel, if the Earth\u2019s fossil fuel resources were to be burnt at this rate, then they would be\nexhausted in a mere 50 milliseconds.\n\nThe solar wind is another outward flux from the Sun. It is a flow of plasma expelled\nat high velocity. In reality it forms the outermost layer of the solar atmosphere, being\ncontinuously driven outward as a result of the Sun\u2019s radiation pressure. At Earth, the\nspeed of the wind is ?450 km/s, its density is ?9 protons/cm3 and its kinetic temperature\nis ?100 000 K.\n\nSunspots are an indication that there are significant disturbances taking place on the\nSun\u2019s surface and through its atmosphere. These, first observed by Galileo, are regions\nof its disc which are cooler than the surrounding surface. They emit less radiation and\nthus appear as dark spots. Periods of high solar activity occur when there are a large\nnumber of sunspots and then enhanced emission of radiation occurs, most notably at\nradio wavelengths and at X-ray and ? -ray energies. This enhanced emission is generally\nassociated with solar flares, which occur at sites near sunspots. They may last from a\nfew minutes to several hours and occur as frequently as one every two hours during high\nsolar activity.\n\nThe Zurich sunspot number Rz is used to quantify the overall number of sunspots on\nthe Sun at any time. It is defined as Rz = K (10g + f ), where f is the number of sunspots\nthat exhibit umbrae, and g is the number of groups into which these spots fall. K is a\nfactor that relates to the observing instrument and is used as a normalization factor.\n\nThe detailed prediction of individual flares is not yet possible, but the general level\nof activity has a well-defined 11-year cycle as shown in Figure 2.8. However, owing to\nmagnetic pole reversal of the Sun at peak solar activity, the real period is 22 years.

The past five cycles\nare shown in Figure 2.8 and it is notable that the period of low solar activity in 2009/10\nexhibited one of the lowest levels of activity on record. Regular updated sunspot activity\nmay be readily accessed at a number of web sites including http://www.dxlc.com/solar,\nwhich provides daily data on a variety of forms of measuring solar activity, including\nsunspot number, the geomagnetic indices and maps of solar active regions. The site\nhttp://sidc.oma.be/index.php3 provides a long-term historical record of solar activity from\n1700 when the first regular recording of sunspot activity took place.\n\nTable 2.2 shows the typical intensity variability of the Sun at particular wavelengths\nwhere it has been established. There is good correlation between sunspot number and\nradiated power at some specific wavelengths and this is used to provide an additional\nmeasure of the overall level of solar activity. The most frequently used monitor is the\nsolar flux at a wavelength of 10.7 cm. One source for such data is from NOAA, in the US.\n\nAn enhanced flux of radiation and high-energy particles is also associated with major\nsolar flares. Two components may be distinguished when it arrives at the Earth. The first\noccurs approximately 20 min following the flare, when the electromagnetic emissions first\nincrease, and then a more prolonged component arrives about a day later. These latter\nparticles appear to be an enhanced component of the solar wind, travelling at velocities\nof ?103 km/s. Figure 2.9 shows the variability of particle fluxes in the interplanetary\nmedium caused by solar activity. Detailed descriptions of ionizing radiations are given in\nthe next section.\n\n2.3.2 Earth orbit environment\n\nThe Earth orbits the Sun at a mean distance of one astronomical unit (AU), equal to\n1.496 \u00d7 108 km. It is a nearly spherical body having a mass of only 3 \u00d7 10?6 times that\nof the Sun, but having a gravitationally bound atmosphere and a significant magnetic\nfield. Each of these features is important in determining the near-Earth environment, in\nwhich the majority of space vehicles operate.\n\nThe atmosphere at sea level is predominantly molecular nitrogen (78%) and molecular\noxygen (21%), with a variety of trace elements, the most significant being argon. Standard\nsea-level pressure is accepted to be 1.013 \u00d7 105 Pa [6]. The lower atmosphere, up to\n?86 km, is sufficiently turbulent to result in a homogeneous gas mixture, albeit with a\n\n\n\nOPERATIONAL SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENTS 2.3 21\n\nProtons\nElectrons\n\nElectron flare envelope\n\nAugust 1972 flare\nAugust 1972\n\nflare\n\nGalactic\nprotons\n\nSolar\nmaximum\n\nQuiet time\n\nSolar\nwind\n\n1011\n\n1010\n\n109\n\n108\n\n107\n\n106\n\n105\n\n104\n\n103\n\n102\n\n101\n\n100\n\n10?1\n\nIn\nte\n\ngr\nal\n\n fl\nux\n\n [p\nar\n\ntic\nle\n\ns/\n(c\n\nm\n2  \n\ns)\n]\n\n101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 1010\n\nParticle energy (eV)\n\nFigure 2.9 Electron and proton spectra.

Above this height, photochemical processes disturb the\nhomogeneity. Of particular importance is the absorption of UV radiation from the Sun,\nleading to the dissociation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere. The details of the processes\nare beyond the scope of this chapter and the interested reader is referred to Reference\n[6]; however, the resultant atmosphere above ?120 km is one in which each atmospheric\nconstituent is decoupled from all the others. For each species, it is then possible to write\ndown an equation of the diffusive equilibrium of the form\n\nni?i + Di\n(\n\ndni\ndZ\n\n+ ni (1 + ?i )\nT\n\ndT\n\ndZ\n+ gni\n\nR?\nMi\nT\n\n)\n= 0 (2.1)\n\nwhere ni is the number density of species i , having a molecular weight Mi at altitude Z , ?i\nis the vertical transport velocity of the species, and Di and ?i are its molecular and thermal\ndiffusion coefficients, T is the atmospheric temperature, R? is the universal gas constant\nand g is the height-dependent acceleration due to gravity. If negligible vertical transport\ntakes place, and for species in which thermal diffusion is negligible, equation (2.1) reduces\nto a hydrostatic equilibrium equation wherein the number density profile is driven by the\natmospheric temperature. Figure 2.10 shows the variation of number density with height\nfor different species.\n\n\n\n22 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nG\neo\n\nm\net\n\nric\n a\n\nlti\ntu\n\nde\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\n108 1010 1012 1014 1016 1018 1020 1022 1024 1026\n\nNumber density (m?3)\n\nO1\nO2\nN2\nAr\nH1\nHe\n\nTotal\n\n(a)\n\nG\neo\n\nm\net\n\nric\n a\n\nlti\ntu\n\nde\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\nNumber density (m?3) Number density (m?3)\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n1010 1012 1014 1016 1018 1010 1012 1014 1016 1018\n\n(b) (c)\n\nSunspot minimum\n1976 standard\nExceptionally\nhigh solar and\ngeomagnetic\nactivity\n\nHe\n\nN2\n\nN2\n\nN2\n\nAr\n\nAr\n\nAr\n\nAr\n\nN2\n\nHe\n\nHe\n\nHe\n\nH\n\nH\n\nH\n\nH\n\nH\n\nH\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO O2\n\nO2\n\nO2\n\nO2\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nG\neo\n\nm\net\n\nric\n a\n\nlti\ntu\n\nde\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\n1976 standard\nExceptionally\nhigh solar and\ngeomagnetic\nactivity\n\nSunspot minimum\n\nFigure 2.10 Species concentration (a) in the US standard atmosphere, and (b, c) under\nextreme conditions\n\nFor detailed calculation of the atmosphere, a variety of models are available (e.g.\nReferences [7, 8]). Each of these requires the specification of a temperature at some height,\nand then by using a pre-defined temperature profile, the density may be determined through\nequation (2.1). Figure 2.11 shows the general form of such profiles. It can be seen from this\nthat at extreme altitudes the temperature tends to a limiting value, the so-called exospheric\ntemperature, T?. Within the exosphere the atmosphere is effectively isothermal. T? rises\nthrough increased solar activity; most models relate it to the flux of solar radiation at\n10.7 cm (F10.7) through an algorithm, and also include the effects of geomagnetic activity,\n\n\n\nOPERATIONAL SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENTS 2.3 23\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nG\neo\n\nm\net\n\nric\n a\n\nlti\ntu\n\nde\n (\n\nkm\n)\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\nKinetic temperature (K)\n\n1976\n\n1962\n\nFigure 2.11 The temperature profile of the atmosphere with altitude\n\nstimulated by the interaction of the solar wind and the Earth\u2019s magnetic environment or\nmagnetosphere (see below).

The pio-\nneering work of King-Hele in this field [9] provides the most comprehensive of these\nanalytic models, which have the potential to describe the variation of scale height in the\natmosphere with altitude, and the effects of atmospheric oblateness and rotation. Whilst\nthese expressions can become complex, for the case wherein only scale height variations\naround a single orbit are concerned, the equivalent density may be written:\n\n? = ?p\n[\n\n1 + ?0\nHp\n\n(r ? rp)\n]?1/?0\n\n(2.3)\n\n\n\n24 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\nwhere suffix p refers to conditions at perigee of the orbit, H is the scale height and ?0, the\naltitude gradient of H , is a constant of order of the eccentricity of the orbit (see Chapter 4).\n\nFor circular orbits in which e is zero, clearly equation (2.3) provides difficulty. However,\nin such cases the altitude of the satellite remains constant, and it is then inappropriate to\nconsider the variation in scale height.\n\nThe most recent US standard atmosphere 1976 [6] is shown in Figure 2.10. At altitudes\ntypical of LEO vehicles (300\u2013900 km) the density is low, but not insignificant. At geosta-\ntionary altitude, ?36 000 km, the density of the neutral atmosphere is approximately the\nsame as in the interplanetary medium, namely, 10?20 kg/m3, and the pressure is ?10?15 Pa.\nThe dominant species of the atmosphere in LEO is generally either atomic oxygen or\nhelium. The effects of atomic oxygen on surfaces are considered in Section 2.4.1.\n\nOne of the most frequently used models of the thermosphere is the MSIS model [7].\nThis was originally produced in 1986 but has been revised in the MSISE-90 model\nand in 2001 as NRLMSISE-00. This includes both shuttle flight data and incoherent radar\nscattering data. It is now possible to access a variety of atmospheric models on the NASA\nFTP site at ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/atmospheric. This can be used to produce\ndensity profiles of the major atomic and molecular species together with temperature and\ntotal density information on a longitude, latitude specific basis.\n\nFew atomic/molecular collisions take place between components of the atmosphere\nand spacecraft in either LEO or GEO. Table 2.3 shows that above 200 km altitude the\nmean free path is significantly greater than the dimensions of most space vehicles. This\nhas two consequences.\n\nFirstly, the ability to exchange heat energy with the environment is solely as a result\nof radiation. Thus the dominant radiative heat input is due to solar radiation, which in the\nnear-Earth environment is 1371 \u00b1 5 W/m2. Secondary input occurs as a result of Earth\nalbedo (the reflection of solar radiation from the top of the atmosphere) and Earth shine\n(the black-body radiation of the Earth), which has a magnitude of ?200 W/m2. The neutral\natmosphere at ?103 K and the solar wind at ?2 \u00d7 105 K provide negligible heating. The\ntemperature that a space vehicle reaches is thus dependent upon a balance of radiative\nheat input and output (see Chapter 11).\n\nSecondly, the aerodynamics of spacecraft at orbiting altitudes must be based upon free\nmolecular flow as briefly described in Chapter 4. Since the density is low, the frictional\nheating forces are negligible, even though the relative velocity approaches 8 km/s.\n\nThe ionosphere, above ?86 km, is a region of increasing plasma density caused by\nphoto-ionization, due to incident UV photons. The plasma has a significantly lower density\n\nTable 2.3 Mean free path ?0 as a function of altitude\n\nAltitude (km) ?0 (m) Altitude (km) ?0 (m)\n\n100 0.142 300 2.6 \u00d7 103\n120 3.31 400 16 \u00d7 103\n140 18 500 77 \u00d7 103\n160 53 600 280 \u00d7103\n180 120 700 730 \u00d7 103\n200 240 800 1400 \u00d7 103\n\n\n\nOPERATIONAL SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENTS 2.3 25\n\nthan the neutral density below an altitude of ?1000 km, even though its peak value occurs\nat 300\u2013400 km. It has significant influences upon the propagation of radio waves; for an\nelectron density ne electrons cm?3, frequencies below the plasma frequency, given by\nfp ? 9000?ne Hz, cannot propagate, and thus radio waves of lower frequency incident\nupon such a plasma will be reflected. If there is additionally a magnetic field present, as\nis the case in the near-Earth environment, then the polarization of any electromagnetic\nradiation propagating through the plasma will be rotated due to Faraday rotation; ineffi-\nciencies can then occur in communication systems if linearly polarized radio waves are\nused (see Chapter 12).\n\nThe Earth\u2019s magnetic field has two primary sources. The dominant one at its surface\nis due to currents circulating within its core, while at higher altitudes the currents caused\nby the differential motion of electrons and ions in the magnetosphere play a significant\nrole. The solar wind plasma, carrying its own magnetic field, distorts the Earth\u2019s simple\ndipole field into the shape shown in Figure 2.12, with both open and closed magnetic\nfield lines.\n\nFrom Figure 2.12 it is apparent that at high altitude the magnetic field structure is\ncomplex; however, at lower altitude it is possible to make certain observations. Firstly,\nthe overall strength of the magnetic field is not constant, but is decreasing at ?0.05% per\nyear.

There may also be\nsignificant fluxes of heavy ions such as of helium (He), nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) whose\natmospheric densities depend on solar and geomagnetic activity. The overall structure of\nthe Van Allen belts can be seen from the highly simplified diagram in Figure 2.14.\n\nProton energies range from 0.01 to 400 MeV with fluxes in the range of 108 to 600/cm2\n\ns, respectively. Electron energies are in the range from 0.4 to 4.5 MeV with fluxes from\n4 \u00d7 108 to 100/cm2 s, respectively. One of the most notable features of the radiation belt\nparticles is the large variation with both altitude and latitude. Figure 2.15 shows typical\ncontour plots of the electron and proton fluxes at various locations [12].\n\nTo predict electron and proton fluxes for LEO missions, the NASA models AE8 [13]\nand AP8 [14] are used. Since these particle fluxes vary with the solar cycle, there are two\nvariants for each model, the maximum and minimum, corresponding to the maximum\nand minimum of the solar cycle, respectively. However, it should be noted that the\nsolar cycle variations of the fluxes are not well understood. Furthermore, the data on\nwhich these models are based are old (circa 1960s and 1970s), and the model should\nonly really be used to predict integrated fluxes (fluences) for periods greater than about\nsix months. More recent models are also available through NASA, as may be found at\nhttp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/space_weather/Space_Weather_at_SSDOO.html.\n\nAt low altitudes and low inclinations, the dominant feature of the radiation environment\nis the region known as the South Atlantic Anomaly . Because of the offset and tilt of the\ngeomagnetic axis relative to Earth\u2019s rotation axis, this is a region of enhanced radiation\nin which parts of the radiation belt are brought to lower altitudes (see Figure 2.16).\n\n\n\n28 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n?2\n\n?4\n\n?6\n\ny \n(R\n\ne)\n\ny \n(R\n\ne)\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nx (Re)\n\nx (Re)\n\nElectron radiation belts\n\nProton radiation belts\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n?1\n\n?2\n0 1 2 3 4\n\n1.E+02\n\n1.E+01\n\n1.E+01\n\n1.E+01\n\n1.E+\n02\n\n1.E+02\n\n1.E+03\n\n1.E+05\n\n1.E+04\n1.E+03\n\n1.E+04\n\n2.E+05\n\n1.\nE\n\n+0\n2\n\n1.\nE+\n\n03\n\n1.E\n+02 1.E+05\n\n1.E+05\n\n1.E+04\n\n1.E\n+0\n\n4 1.E+06\n\n2.\nE+\n\n06\n3.\n\nE\n+0\n\n6\n\n1.E+\n02\n\n1.E+02 1.E+04\n1.E+04 1.E+05\n\n1.E+06\n\n1.E+03\n\n1.E+03\n\n1.E+\n03\n\n1.E+03\n\nFigure 2.15 Radiation belt model particle fluxes.

While the detailed processes\nassociated with these damage types is somewhat complex, the key phenomena that take\nplace result from the impact of the high-energy particle upon both the energy structure\nand lattice structure of the semiconductor material. The damage influence of an individual\nmassive particle, such as a proton, is significantly greater than that from an electron due\nto the higher momentum carried by the former. In particular, if, for example, a proton is\nstopped in the material, because of the momentum exchange a significant displacement\nof a lattice atom will occur. This displacement can result in local ionization and the\ndisruption, again locally, in the energy structure, possibly with the creation of additional\nenergy states between the conduction and valence bands. The ionization process results\nin an impulsive release of charge, leading to an SEU. Changes to the energy structure\nresult in a reduction in the efficiency of solar cells converting sunlight to electricity\n(see Chapter 10). Both electrons and protons contribute to the total dose and the major\ncontribution will depend on the particular orbit; in general, low altitude orbits (less than\nabout 800 km) will be dominated by protons, whereas high altitude orbits including\ngeosynchronous orbits, will be dominated by electrons (see Figure 2.17).

Because of\nthe relative magnitudes of electron and proton fluxes, it is not easy to generalize about\ntheir contributions to the displacement damage (usually expressed as a 1 MeV equivalent\nfluence), but as with total dose, protons usually dominate at low altitude and electrons at\nhigh altitude.\n\nGalactic cosmic radiation is composed of high-energy nuclei, believed to propagate\nthroughout all space unoccupied by dense matter. Its origin is still a matter of scientific\ndebate and may have both galactic and extragalactic sources.\n\nPrimary cosmic radiation is by definition that which is incident on the Earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere. Cosmic rays propagating through the atmosphere undergo nuclear collisions and\ngenerate secondary rays consisting of all known nuclear and sub-nuclear species. The flux\nof galactic cosmic radiation is believed to be essentially isotropic outside the heliosphere;\ninside it, propagation effects result in an isotropy of approximately 1%.\n\nHigh-energy cosmic ray particles have a large amount of kinetic energy and this can\nhave a permanent effect upon the material through which they pass.\n\nPrimary cosmic radiation observed at the Earth\u2019s orbit consists of approximately 83%\nprotons, 13% alpha particles, 1% nuclei of atomic number greater than two and 3%\nelectrons. The composition extends over an energy range from a few hundred MeV to\ngreater than 1020 MeV. Figure 2.18 [15] shows typical quiet-time spectra for several\nelements. The intensity of cosmic rays observed is dependent on the solar cycle, decreasing\nas the sunspot number cycle increases.\n\nDuring their travel from their source regions to the vicinity of the Earth, cosmic rays\ninteract with the interstellar medium. This causes fragmentation to occur, resulting in a\ndepletion of the heavy charge primary rays and an increase in the lighter nuclei. The\nlow-energy portion of the cosmic ray spectrum is quite variable, reflecting its dependence\non solar modulation; from solar cycle minimum to maximum, the energy density of near-\nEarth primary galactic rays decreases by about 40%. The ray intensity observed at Earth\ndoes not change smoothly from maximum to minimum values, but decreases in a series\nof sharp drops followed by a partial recovery until the minimum intensity is reached near\nto the maximum in the solar activity.\n\nSolar energetic particle events\n\nPart of the energy in solar flares is in the form of nuclei accelerated to high energies and\nreleased into space. These are commonly referred to by descriptive names such as solar\ncosmic events, solar proton events, solar electron events, solar cap absorption events and\nground level events. The most commonly measured components of these are the proton\nand electron events. Major solar particle events occur at random, with a frequency that\nvaries from approximately one every two months to one every two years. Events initiated\nby solar flares may also contain a small apparently variable flux of heavier elements.\n\nSolar proton events are statistical in nature, showing a wide variation in characteristic\nparameters such as integrated flux (fluence), peak flux and energy spectrum. One method\nfor predicting proton fluence for space missions is that of Feynman et al . [16] and is\nbased on a combination of observations made from the Earth\u2019s surface, from above the\natmosphere between 1956 and 1963 and from spacecraft in the vicinity of Earth between\n1963 and 1985. Analysis of these data shows that there are seven hazardous years during\neach solar cycle, beginning two years before the solar maximum year and extending to four\n\n\n\n32 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\n10?3\n\n10?4\n\n10?5\n\n10?6\n\n10?7\n\nN\nuc\n\nle\ni/(\n\ncm\n2  \n\nsr\n s\n\nec\n M\n\neV\n/n\n\nuc\nle\n\non\n)\n\n1 101 102 103\n\nKinetic energy (MeV/nucleon)\n\nQuiet time cosmic ray spectra\n(1974?1978)\n\nHydrogen\n\nHelium\n\nOxygen\n\nNitrogen\n\nCarbon\n\nFigure 2.18 Quiet-time energy spectra for the elements H, He, C, N and O, measured at\n1 AU over the solar minimum period from 1974 to 1978.

More recent tools for prediction are available through the ESA. A suitable\nlink to this via http://www.esa.int/TEC/Space_Environment/SEMNW3SMTWE_0.html.\n\nFigure 2.19 shows the probability of exceeding a given fluence level over the life of a\nmission, assuming a constant heliocentric distance of 1 AU. If a mission is in space for\nmore than one solar cycle, the best method for finding the total expected fluence is to esti-\nmate the fluence per cycle from the seven-year curve and add the appropriate number of\nadditional yearly fluences to this line. The use of the one-year curve to estimate the addi-\ntional fluence expected on a long mission is not recommended because it will lead to an\noverestimate. Correction for the dependence on the distance from the Sun (r) may be made\nby assuming that it varies as r?3 for r less than 1 AU, and as r?2 for r greater than 1 AU.\n\nSolar protons are accelerated in solar active regions during solar flares, and X-ray, radio\nand optical emissions are indicators that particle acceleration is occurring.

Their\nfluxes and fluences can be found by extrapolation from those of protons, using elemental\nabundance ratios normalized to hydrogen. Typical values are shown in Table 2.4 [17].\n\nTable 2.4 Normalized abundances of solar energetic particle\nevents [17].

As a consequence, currents\nwill occur between the space vehicle and the plasma, imbalance of which will cause\nspacecraft to develop a charge that may be returned to balance through arcing. The two\nmajor sources of currents are [11] the ambient plasma itself and photoelectron emission\ndue to sunlight, and in particular, the short wavelength component of this radiation. The\nlatter phenomenon is particularly important when the spacecraft enters and leaves eclipses\n[18]. Severe problems arise if differential charging of the spacecraft surface occurs. The\nsimplest method of preventing this is to use conductive surfaces wherever possible. One\nprimary area in which this is not possible is on the solar array; an alternative solution is\nthen to apply a near transparent coating of indium oxide to the cell cover glass material,\nwhich typically reduces the resistivity of the glass surface to less than 5000 ?/cm2 [19].\n\nMeteoroids and micrometeoroids occur with a frequency that varies considerably with\nthe type of space mission. These are solid objects whose mass and size vary over many\norders of magnitude. Their mass spectrum is shown in Figure 2.20. Near large gravitational\nmasses such as the Earth their fluxes tend to be enhanced. The asteroid belt is also a region\nof enhanced meteoroid density. Impact of micrometeoroids generally causes a degradation\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n?8\n\n?16\n\n?16 ?8 0 8\nLog10 mass (g)\n\nLo\ng 1\n\n0 \ncu\n\nm\nul\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nflu\n\nx \n(N\n\n/k\nm\n\n2 /\nyr\n\n)\n\n16 24\n\nWhipple; Meteors (1967)\n\nModified Naumann (1966)\n\nShoemaker, airwave objects\n\nModified airwave objects\n\nHawkins, Stones (1963)\n\nShoemaker, Apollo\nobjects\n\nOgo III\nMariner IV\n\nPioneer I\n\nPrairie network; McCrosky (1968)\n\nApollo objects; Whipple (1967)\n\nPegasus I, II, III; Explorer XVI, XXIII;\nNaumann (1966)\n\nHawkins, Irons\n(1963)\n\nAlexander et al\n(1969)\n\nFigure 2.20 Terrestrial mass-influx rates of meteoroids.

Particle impacts led to the failure\nof some experiments and a change in the attitude of the vehicle at closest encounter.\n\nMan-made space debris , consisting of aluminium oxide dust particles (from solid rocket\nexhausts), instrument covers, nuts and bolts, rocket upper stages, and so on is in addition\nto the naturally occurring micrometeoroid environment. The size varies from 0.001 mm\nto 10 m in diameter. Space debris varies with the orbit\u2019s altitude, eccentricity and incli-\nnation, and exhibits a strong directional dependence. The average velocity (relative to\nthe orbiting spacecraft) is about 11 km/s, but it is a function of altitude, ranging from\nzero to twice the orbital velocity. Since the majority of the particles originate from satel-\nlite and launcher components, the average density is assumed to be that of aluminium\nalloys\u2014about 2.8 g/cm3.The threat to space-stations such as the ISS due to the larger\nsizes of particles, greater than 1 mm, has caused a great deal of interest in this envi-\nronment, both in modelling and in measuring it. The collision between Iridium 33 and\nCosmos 2251 in February 2009 has further highlighted the dangers posed to operational\nspacecraft of collisions, together with the substantial increase in the population of debris\nobjects following such collisions. Figure 2.21 provides data on the predicted growth in\ndebris objects by one of the models (LEGEND) used for such simulations. Four test sce-\nnarios were analysed: non-mitigation (\u2018business-as-usual\u2019) scenario, in order to compare\nwith possible active debris removal (ADR) scenarios initiated in 2020, with annual debris\nremoval rates of either 5 (2020/5), 10 (2020/10), and 20 (2020/20) objects per year.

As a result there is a growing realization that active removal of debris may become\na requirement for sustained operation within the LEO environment [22].\n\nThe smaller particles, in the range from 10?3 to 10?9 g, have a flux that is high enough\nto erode surfaces and have enough energy to penetrate protective coatings. Of particular\nconcern is their effect on large solar arrays, sensitive optical surfaces and detectors. The\npossibility of penetrating protective coatings necessitates the consideration of synergistic\neffects between the particulate and the atomic oxygen environments. See Section 2.4.1.\n\nSystem requirements for meteoroid and debris protection amount generally to ensuring\nthe safety of people for crewed spacecraft and the operational availability for unmanned\ncraft. Usually, these requirements are expressed as the probability of no damage over a\ngiven time. For example, typical probability values for the Columbus Attached Laboratory\nrange from 0.995 for endangering the crew or module\u2019s survivability for a 10-year life, to\n0.999 for penetration or bursting over a one-year period. Having set the system require-\nment probabilities, the critical debris size can be calculated using the environment models\nand the spacecraft geometry. For ISS, the critical debris size ranges from about 0.5\u20131.0 cm\n[23]. One resource available for predicting the micrometeorite and debris impact on space\nvehicles is the ESABase software package, available through http://esabase2.net/.\n\nEffective shielding can be achieved by using a double-walled bumper shield, in which\nthe first wall fragments the impacting particle into a cloud of smaller, slower moving\ndebris, which are then stopped by the second wall (see Chapter 8).\n\n2.3.3 Solar System environments\n\nThe Solar System may be considered to be the region of space that is dominated grav-\nitationally by the Sun. In Chapter 5, this will be defined in greater detail. However, at\nthis point, we can consider the Solar System to be that region containing the eight major\nplanets and their natural satellites, together with all the other minor bodies including the\n\u2018dwarf planet\u2019 Pluto, asteroids, comets and dust, and the residue of the solar wind. Fol-\nlowing the detailed environment of the near-Earth region of space, in which the majority\nof space vehicles operate, it is appropriate to consider briefly the major features of those\nother solar system bodies, which have been the focus of space missions.\n\nTable 2.5 lists the mass properties of the major Solar System bodies together with their\norbital characteristics about the Sun. The definition of the orbital parameters may be found\nin Chapter 4, together with additional data on these objects. The key features discernible\nfrom the data presented in Table 2.5 are firstly, with the exception of Pluto, and to some\nextent Mercury, all the planetary bodies nearly lie in a plane. This can be seen from the\nangle of inclination i , being no more than a few degrees away from the ecliptic plane.\nSecondly, again with the exception of these two bodies, and evidenced by the eccentricity\ne, the planetary orbits are nearly circular. Whilst these two features provide evidence of\nthe history of the solar system, from the consideration of space vehicle design they lead\nto significant design implications. Thus, the near planar nature of the solar system results\nin only relatively minor plane changes being required to send a probe to another solar\nsystem body. This has significant influence on the fuel load for the vehicle\u2019s propulsion\nsystem; details of this are provided in Chapter 5. The circularity of most planetary orbits\nmeans that following orbital insertion about a planet, the spacecraft will not be subject\nto any additional major changes in the thermal environment.

This environment is dominated by the solar wind, for which a description has\nalready been provided. Both solar insolation and the density of the solar wind decrease\nwith distance from the Sun, again with an approximate 1/r2 relationship. For missions\nbeyond Mars, spacecraft need to traverse the asteroid belt, for which there is enhanced\ncollision risk with sizeable objects.\n\nThe planetary environments themselves are very diverse. Table 2.6 provides data on\nthose planets having an atmosphere, together with what is known about such atmospheres\nand any associated ionosphere. Only Mercury of the four inner planets does not have\nan atmosphere. The atmospheres of Venus, Earth and Mars are radically different, both\nin their composition and thermodynamic properties of pressure and temperature. It is\nparticularly noteworthy that lander missions to Venus are required to operate both in the\nvacuum of space, and then on arrival at the surface of that planet survive pressures over\n90 times that at the surface of the Earth, whilst the temperature is of order 750 K.\n\nTitan is also included in Table 2.6, being the sole natural satellite of a planet that pos-\nsesses a significant atmosphere. Our knowledge of Titan and its atmosphere has improved\nsignificantly following the successful landing by ESA\u2019s Huygens probe in January 2005,\npart of the joint ESA/NASA Cassini/Huygens mission to the Saturnian system. A complete\nreview of the findings from this mission may be found in [24].\n\nThe four gas giants are listed here as having atmospheres. The surface properties noted\nare however for an assumed surface, on which the pressure of the atmosphere is the same\nas that on the Earth at sea level.\n\nA necessary condition for a planet to have an ionosphere\u2014a region of space that\ncontains free electrons and ions\u2014is that it also has an atmosphere. The major energy\nsource for the ionization of the upper regions of an atmosphere is solar radiation through\n\nTable 2.6 Solar System data: approximate atmospheric parameters for solar system\nbodies\n\nPlanet/ Composition Surface Surface Temperature Ionosphere\nMoon % pressure temperature @ 200 km (Electrons/\n\n(Bar) (K) (K) cm3)\n\nMercury None \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nVenus CO2 (96); N2 (3.5) 92 750 100\u2013280 ? 106\nEarth N2 (77); O2 (21); H2 (1) 1 285 800\u20131100 ? 106\nMars CO2 (95); Ar (1.6); N2 (2.7) 0.006 220 310 ? 105\nJupiter H2 (89); CH4 (0.2); He (11) Gaseous planet 1651 ? 105\nSaturn H2 (93); CH4 (0.2); He (7) Gaseous planet 1301\n\nTitan N2 (90\u201399); CH2 (1\u20135); Ar (0\u20136) 1.5 95 150 ? 103\nUranus H2 (85); CH4(< 1); He (15) Gaseous planet 801\n\nNeptune H2 (90); CH4(< 1); He (10) Gaseous planet 701\n\nPluto N2 CH4/CO (traces only) \u2014 40 \u2014 \u2014\n\n1Temperature quoted where pressure is the same as Earth sea level (P = 1 Bar).\nSee also Tables 2.5, 2.7 and 4.1.\n\n\n\nOPERATIONAL SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENTS 2.3 39\n\nthe process of photo-ionization. Typical peak electron densities in each of those bodies\nhaving an ionosphere is provided in Table 2.6. As might be expected, Venus and Earth,\nhaving the most significant atmospheres of the terrestrial planets, and also being relatively\nclose to the Sun, have the highest ionospheric electron number density.\n\nIf a planet also possesses a magnetic field, then this will influence the properties of the\nionosphere. As noted for the Earth, a magnetic field provides an opportunity to both trap\nand add energy to charged particles, which in general may originate from the planetary\natmosphere/ionosphere or from the solar wind. The magnetic properties of the major\nsolar system bodies are listed in Table 2.7. As we have already noted for the Earth,\nits magnetic field leads to the formation of the Van Allen radiation belts. The most\nsignificant magnetosphere in the solar system is however that of Jupiter, which acts as\nan energy source for the generation of relativistic particles that radiate by synchrotron\nemission. Whilst Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere is far more complex than that of the Earth, its\noverall structure is similar to that shown in Figure 2.12. The magnetosphere for Jupiter is\nvast\u2014the magneto-tail extends to the orbit of Saturn. This magnetic field co-rotates with\nJupiter, which has a period of just less than 10 hours. This provides an additional source\nof energy to accelerate particles. Further, the satellite Io passes through the plasma sheet\nformed within the magnetosphere. Io contributes ions, principally from the dissociation\nproducts of SO2, to this plasma sheet from intense volcanic activity on its surface. At\nthis stage, it is not clear however whether Io has its own magnetic field. The overall\ninteraction yields resultant particle fluxes that are several orders of magnitude greater than\n\nTable 2.7 Solar System data\n\nPlanet/ Number Presence Magnetic field- Magnetopause Major\nMoon of moons of rings Dipole moment height (units missions\n\n(Relative to Earth) of Requator)\n\nMercury \u2014 \u2014 0.0007 1.5 Mariner 10\nVenus \u2014 \u2014 <0.0004 \u2014 Mariner 2/5/10\n\nVenera 3\u201316\nPioneer Venus 1/2\n\nEarth 1 \u2014 1 10 \u2014\nMars 2 \u2014 <0.0002 \u2014 Mariner 4/6/7/9\n\nMars 2/3\nViking 1/2\nMars Pathfinder\n\nJupiter 16 Yes 20 000 80 Pioneer 10/11\nVoyager 1/2\nGalileo\n\nSaturn 18 Yes 600 20 Pioneer 11\nVoyager 1/2\nCassini\n\nTitan N/A \u2014 None detected \u2014 Cassini/Huygens probe\nUranus 17 Yes 50 20 Voyager 2\nNeptune 8 Yes 25 25 Voyager 2\nPluto 1 \u2014 Unknown Unknown None\n\nNotes: See also Tables 2.5, 2.6 and 4.1.\n\n\n\n40 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\nthose at the peak flux of the Earth\u2019s own radiation belts. These particles in the Jovian\nsystem, coupled with the motion of Io\u2019s motion through the magnetosphere also provide\nan intense electromagnetic radiation source, extending from VLF ?10 MHz through to\n3 GHz. Not surprisingly therefore, all missions that transit the Jovian magnetosphere have\nshown signs of radiation damage in electronic circuits and the darkening of exposed\noptical systems. The radiation dose absorbed on the two grand-tour Pioneer spacecraft\nwas a thousand times beyond the level of human tolerance [25]. As a result the Jovian\nsystem, having the additional feature common with the other gas giants of a ring system,\nproves to be one of the most hostile environments in the Solar System.\n\n2.4 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON DESIGN\n\n2.4.1 Effects on materials\n\nOutgassing or sublimation refers to the vaporization of surface atoms of a material when\nit is subjected to an ambient pressure that is comparable with its own vapour pressure.\nSuch a pressure, 10?11 \u201310?15 Pa, occurs at spacecraft altitudes. This process occurs at\nan increasing rate as temperature rises. A summary of rates for different metals at a\nvariety of temperatures is shown in Table 2.8 but they do not apply to alloy materials or\nthose having a covering surface layer of a different material. Since the precise surface\nconditions of orbiting vehicles are difficult to determine, particularly for vehicles in LEO,\nexact figures for mass loss are not at present available. While structural problems arising\nbecause of outgassing are unlikely, the subsequent deposition of the material is hazardous\nto both optical and electrically sensitive surfaces. Thin plastic layers and oxide coatings\nare particularly sensitive to mass loss, especially if the material is used for its thermal\nproperties; if mass loss is associated with specific constituents then modified emissive\nproperties may result.\n\nFor plastic materials, high-vapour-pressure components evaporate rapidly, although ini-\ntially mass loss is usually associated with the loss of adsorbed gases and water vapour.\n\nTraditional lubricants used on the ground are clearly not appropriate to spacecraft\noperation. Generally, they have high vapour pressure and would thus outgas rapidly,\nbut in many the lubricative action arises because of the presence of adsorbed gases and\nwater vapour. While low-volatility oils are used, solid lubricant coatings such as MoS2 are\n\nTable 2.8 Temperature for a given sublimation rate ( ?C)\n\nElement 0.1 ?m/yr 10 ?m/yr 1 mm/yr\n\nCd 38 77 122\nZn 71 127 177\nMg 110 171 233\nAu 660 800 950\nTi 920 1070 1250\nMo 1380 1630 1900\nW 1870 2150 2480\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON DESIGN 2.4 41\n\nfrequently adopted. Reference [10] provides a detailed listing of ESA\u2019s materials database\n(but see also Chapter 15).\n\nAtomic oxygen erosion\n\nThe atmospheric composition shown in Figure 2.10 indicates that atomic oxygen forms\nthe major atmospheric species in LEO. Following the severe erosion noted for Kapton on\nSTS3 [26], it became apparent that atomic oxygen provides an aggressive environment for\nmaterials used on space vehicles in LEO. This arises not only from its chemical activity,\nbut most significantly from the fact that its atoms are travelling at ?8 km/s relative to the\nvehicle (due to the vehicle\u2019s orbital motion). Silver is one of the few metals attacked by\nthis environment, so due to its extensive use on solar arrays, it is important to avoid bare\nsilver exposure.\n\nThe interactions between the oxygen atoms and the spacecraft surfaces are erosion,\nformation of stable oxide, scattering or reflection and chemiluminescent glow. When\nerosion takes place volatile products are formed, causing surface recession. Erosion rates\nare usually quoted in terms of yield in units of 10?24 cm3/atom. Erosion yields range from\n0.01 to 0.09 for materials like aluminium-coated kapton, FEP teflon and silicones at the\nlow end, to between 2 and 4 for polyethylene, Kapton-H and Z-302 (glossy black) [27].\n\nThe net effect of this erosion interaction is to degrade the material properties (optical,\nthermal, mechanical and electrical) irreversibly, and so this must be taken into account\nwhen choosing materials for optical and thermal control coatings, structural material,\nthermal blankets, solar panels and optical components. The first major contribution to\nour knowledge of the space-based exposure to AO followed analysis of the NASA Long\nDuration Exposure Facility (LDEF), which spent 5.8 years in LEO and was retrieved\nin January 1990. Greatly improved understanding has been provided by the experiments\non ISS, such as series MISSE [28]. As a result a detailed picture has been produced\nboth of the erosion rates and methods for protection, and potential failure mechanisms in\nsuch protection [29].\n\nStable oxide formation can lead to significant property changes. For example, molyb-\ndenum disulfide, which is a lubricant, can oxidize to create an abrasive oxide [30].\nDimensional changes can also occur, leading to cracking in the formation of a surface\noxide layer on silicone (due to contraction and expansion), and spalling in the case of\noxidation of silver.\n\nIndirect impingement caused by ram atoms scattered from adjacent surfaces can lead to\nerosion of surfaces \u2018shadowed\u2019 from direct attack. The chemiluminescent glow at visible\nwavelengths, observed on the Space Shuttle and around small spacecraft [31], is currently\nthought to be caused by surface mediated O + NO recombination, forming excited NO2\nmolecules that then radiate [32].\n\nSome work has been done on the use of protective coatings that are resistive to the\nattack of atomic oxygen [27], but the problems of either manufacture-induced pinholes\nor those created by debris/micrometeoroid impact must be overcome [33].\n\nSimulation of the atomic oxygen environment has become particularly important.\nFurther information on this critical feature of the environment may be found in\nReferences [34] and [35].\n\nMaterial strength and fatigue life are also affected by a high-vacuum environment.\nGenerally, fatigue life is improved. For many materials, it may be extended by more than\n\n\n\n42 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\nan order of magnitude [36], although in some cases, for example, pure nickel and Inconel\n550, the improvement is uncertain [36, 37]. The physical reasons for such changes in\nmechanical properties, and also changes in strength, are believed to arise because of one\nof two principal reasons. One of these is that gases absorbed into surface cracks either\naid or hinder crack propagation. The second possible physical cause is that oxidation\nand gas diffusion absorbed into the material bulk influences material properties. A well-\ndocumented example of a material whose strength is improved in vacuum is that of glass,\nwherein a threefold improvement in strength has been noted at a pressure that is one\nthousandth that of atmospheric pressure.\n\nEmbrittlement is a form of material damage that is caused by exposure to UV radiation.\nMany polymers are particularly sensitive to such photons, whose energy is high enough\nto modify their chemical bonding structure.\n\nUltraviolet exposure also causes electrical changes in the form of resistivity modifica-\ntion, and optical changes affecting both thermal characteristics and opacity. A particularly\nUV-sensitive element is the solar array. More specifically the solar cell coverglass and its\nattendant adhesive are subject to darkening. This results in reduced cell illumination and an\nenhanced operating temperature, both being deleterious to cell operation (see Chapter 10).\n\nRadiation damage affects all materials to some extent, and humans. High-energy cor-\npuscular radiation is experienced most severely in the Van Allen radiation belts, but is\nalso at a significant level in any space operation. Under even modest radiation doses,\nsome metals such as cadmium and zinc may form metallic whiskers.\n\nSemiconductor materials and biological tissue are particularly sensitive to damage\ncaused by high-energy charged and neutral particles. This generally arises because of\nboth the displacement of atoms from crystal lattice sites and the attendant local ioniza-\ntion, together with an ionization track caused by the penetrating radiation. Protection is\na complex task, since screening material will itself generate secondary radiations due to\nthe passage of a primary high-energy particle through it. It should be noted that \u2018heavy\u2019\nparticles such as protons and neutrons cause significantly more damage than light ones\nsuch as electrons. They cause a dense track of ionization through a material until they are\nstopped by an atomic collision. When this occurs, a significant displacement of the atom\narises, leading to further ionization, which does not occur for electrons.\n\nRadiation shielding analysis\n\nTo ensure that electronic components such as transistors, diodes and so on are capable\nof surviving the radiation environment, the total dose inside the spacecraft, in rads has\nto be calculated. This is done for the specific orbit in question by first calculating the\nfluence spectrum of the external (unshielded) particles\u2014the number of particles/cm2 at\nspecific energies. The shielded environment is then determined by transporting the external\nfluence through the spacecraft mass. Usually, the first step is to calculate a one-dimensional\ndose\u2014depth curve based on a spherical shell geometry of aluminium. The dose behind\na thickness typical of the spacecraft (usually about 2.5\u20133.8 mm) is read from this curve.\nThis dose is then used with some design margin, typically between 1.3 and 2, to set the rad\nhardness requirement for electronic parts. If parts to be used fall below this requirement,\nseveral options are available; a more detailed three-dimensional analysis can be carried\nout to determine the dose at the actual location of the \u2018soft\u2019 parts. This usually results\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON DESIGN 2.4 43\n\nin the lowering of the dose with the inclusion of more individual spacecraft components\nfurther reducing the dose values. If the dose is still too high, then spot shielding can be\nimplemented (i.e. the placement of a shield of tantalum or tungsten at the location of the\nactual part), or a rad-hard version of the part can be sought.\n\nOther radiation effects including single-event phenomena, noise in charge-coupled\ndevices CCDs (and optical detectors), and radiobiological interactions also need to include\nthe transport of the primary particles through the spacecraft structure. While, in general,\nshielding is beneficial and reduces the hazard caused by the radiation, in some cases large\nthicknesses of shielding can worsen the effects. For example, in considering single-event\neffects (SEEs), a heavy ion passing through a certain thickness of material will be slowed\ndown to such an extent that its linear energy transfer (LET), and therefore its ability to\nproduce ionization, is increased. Consideration must also be given to secondary particles\nproduced as a result of the interaction of the primaries with the atoms of the shielding\nmaterial. For example, secondary neutrons produced by proton fluxes can pose a problem\nfor human space missions in orbits where the proton flux is high (trapped proton fluxes\nat altitudes greater than 500 km, and solar protons in high inclination orbits). Protons can\nalso be responsible for SEEs in the South Atlantic Anomaly and in polar regions during\nsolar flares, by producing secondary recoiling nuclei and light fragments [38].\n\nThe production of radioactive materials, which is called activation, can also be a\nproblem. This may lead to dose problems on long, human space missions such as the\nInternational Space Station, and can also induce limiting background noise levels in\nlow-level measurements made by radiation detectors.\n\nIn semiconductor materials, two damaging effects have been noted. Primarily, radiation\ndamage reduces the effectiveness of semiconductor operation. Specifically in solar cells,\nit results in a reduction in the efficiency of conversion from sunlight to electrical energy.\nIn order to quantify the effect of this, the spacecraft designer usually resorts to tables of\nfluence for particular orbits. The upper, exposed surface of the cell may be protected to\nsome extent by the use of a coverglass. The lower surface is generally protected by the\nsubstrate on which it is mounted. Manufacturers\u2019 calibration data is generally available\nto enable the expected degradation in solar cell performance to be assessed during the\nmission lifetime. This topic will be returned to in greater detail in Chapter 10.\n\nSingle event effects (SEEs)\n\nIn addition to total dose effects, which are caused by the deposition of energy by many\nparticles, there is a set of phenomena that are caused by single particles. A single-event\nupset (SEU) occurs when a heavy ion is incident on the sensitive area of an integrated\ncircuit, producing sufficient charge in the form of electron\u2014hole pairs to cause a change\nin the logic state of the device. This type of error is known as a \u2018soft\u2019 error since it is\nreversible and causes no permanent damage. However, if it occurs in critical circuitry\nsuch as a control system or decision-making logic, then it can have serious consequences\non the spacecraft operation\u2014generating false commands such as thruster firings.\n\nA single-event latch-up (SEL) occurs when the passage of a single charged particle\nleads to a latched low impedance state in parasitic PNPN devices in bulk complementary\nmetal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) material, and it can result in burn-out. A more serious\neffect is single-event burn-out, which occurs when an incident ion produces a conducting\n\n\n\n44 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\npath\u2014in a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), for example, that\ncauses the device to latch-up; if this condition continues for a sufficiently long time then\nthe device could be completely burnt out and destroyed.\n\nFinally, single-event-induced dark current is caused by the passage of a particle which\ncauses displacement damage in a single pixel.\n\nParticles that cause SEUs include heavy ions, protons and neutrons. Both galactic\ncosmic rays and solar flares contain these. High-energy trapped protons can also cause\nSEUs, not by direct ionization but by the recoiling heavy reaction products. The parameter\nthat characterizes a particle\u2019s ability to cause a SEE is its energy deposition rate, known\nas dE/dx, stopping power, or LET, and is measured in units of MeV/g cm2 or MeV/?m.\n\nSEU sensitivity is largely determined by the critical charge for a sensitive node, which\nis the quantity of charge needed to alter the device\u2019s memory status. The critical charge\nis a function of the feature size and roughly scales with the square of its dimension. SEU\nrates can be determined by combining the LET spectrum of the environment (i.e. the\nnumber of particles with a given energy loss) and the device dimensions.\n\nIn general, systems approaches to SEU-hardening can be divided into three categories:\nerror toleration, error correction and error prevention. The first is costly and involves\nspecifying tolerance levels for various parts of the system, determining maximum per-\nmissible error rates, and designing and constructing each part of the system within these\nconstraints. Tests must be conducted at the subsystem and at the total system levels to\nensure that the tolerance levels are met and that catastrophic failure is impossible. Error-\ncorrection techniques applied at the systems level include: redundant units, self-checking\ncircuits, error-detecting and error-correcting codes, and serial calculation with error correc-\ntion (hardware solution), concurrent programme execution and breakpoint reasonableness\ntesting, checkpoint storage and roll-back for recovery (software solution), and repetitive\nexecution and watchdog timers (time-related solutions) [39]. The last approach involves\nthe choice of components that will not upset; however, there are only a limited number of\nSEU-hard devices for very large scale integrated (VLSI) levels of complexity and speed.\n\nThe potential for software errors is becoming more apparent as the processing power of\non-board computers is increasing. This is a challenging area of current spacecraft design\nfor which solutions are being sought.\n\n2.4.2 Effects on humans\n\nThe removal of human beings from their natural environment or habitat necessarily intro-\nduces deleterious effects. A suitable life-support system will guard against the more obvi-\nous ones such as lack of atmosphere, thermal environment and possible high-acceleration\nloads. Details applicable to the design of a suitable life-support environment may be\nfound in References [40] and [41]. Here we consider the environmental problems for\nwhich a life-support system offers no solution. It should be noted that the response of\nhumans to extended exposure to the space environment still requires further improvement\nand understanding: even following a significant increase in the number of human-years\nin space, this exposure in reality is still modest. A bioastronautics road map has been\nproduced with the aim of mitigating human risks [42].\n\nIn general terms, the response of human beings to spaceflight may be classified under\none of four categories: transient effects lasting for short periods on initial exposure to,\nor removal from, the space environment; flight duration adaptation; cumulative effects\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON DESIGN 2.4 45\n\ndependent upon the length of the flight, which are reversible on return to the ground;\ncumulative effects that are irreversible.\n\nThe dominant effect of the space environment, which cannot be removed through life-\nsupport systems, is zero or microgravity. This causes a major disturbance to the human\nsystem, with effects that fall into each of the first three categories above. The most notable\nof these are the following:\n\n1. Blood volume redistribution. On Earth the blood pressure of a person whilst standing\ndecreases with height above the feet. Typically the pressure in the brain is only one\nthird that in the feet. The immediate effect of a \u2018zero g\u2019 environment is to cause a\nredistribution of the blood volume, resulting in a \u2018puffy\u2019 face. Whilst on Earth, the\nbody system is familiar with orientation changes (lying down, etc.), and a complex\nsystem of hormonal secretion results in a control system that adjusts heart rate to\nthese conditions. In zero gravity, however, this hormonal action appears to result\nin a loss of sodium with consequent fluid loss. Typically stabilization occurs after\n?4 days when a loss of some 2\u20134 kg has occurred. Readaptation on return to Earth\noccurs over a short period of time, during which giddiness may be expected.\n\n2. Muscular atrophy. Atrophy of all muscles occurs through long periods of inactivity.\nIn zero g the heart itself is required to do less work since it is not pumping blood\nagainst gravity. Reduction in both heart muscle mass and heart rate occurs. It is\nbelieved that anaemia (a reduction in red blood cell count) is an additional side\neffect that has been noted in astronauts. To combat general atrophy of muscles\nastronauts spend much of their time in space undergoing physical exercise.\n\n3. Vestibular problems. The human vestibular system is dependent upon both visual\nand inner ear sensors. In the inner ear the sensor has two orthogonal components,\nhorizontal and vertical, which rely on gravity for their operation. Removal of gravity\nresults in enhanced sensitivity to acceleration (including rotation) because of fluid\nmotion in these sensors. Conflict between visual and inner ear sensors therefore\narises during motion of the astronaut. The most notable effect is motion sickness,\nbut astronauts also experience enhanced clumsiness. Adaptation generally takes three\nto four days.\n\n4. Locomotor system. The major effect of zero gravity on the locomotor system is\ncumulative bone decalcification. This directly results in bone fragility and indi-\nrectly leads to problems of recalcification, external to the bones in, for example,\nthe kidneys, forming kidney stones. High calcium diets do not appear to stop this\nincreased calcium mobility and on long duration flights such as Salyut 6, a 2\u20138%\nloss of calcium was noted. Restabilization occurs on return to Earth.\n\nThe corpuscular radiation environment noted in preceding sections evidently provides\na hazardous environment for humans. In the absence of specific solar particle events asso-\nciated with eruptive phenomenon on the Sun, the most damaging health risk to astronauts\nis the galactic cosmic radiation [43]. Shielding materials must be chosen with care, as\npoor design can lead to a secondary radiation that is more hazardous than the primary\nradiation. It is notable that aluminium, a frequently used structural material is one of\nthe worst materials to use in relation to shielding and thus the materials used tend to be\ncomposite materials, albeit encased within thin aluminium face sheets. The composites\nused are those containing elements smaller than carbon, since these reduce the production\nof harmful secondaries and fragmentation of the incident particle [44]. As is clear from\n\n\n\n46 THE SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS EFFECT ON DESIGN\n\nFigures 2.14 through 2.18, the averaged radiation dose is dependent upon the orbit altitude\nand inclination when in Earth orbit. The protective structure of and habitation regions of\nISS result in a dose rate to astronauts of about 0.3 Sv per year [45, 46], approximately\n10 times the dose rate a passenger would receive during a commercial airline flight.\n\nIn addition to the physiological effects, the opportunity for long duration missions to\nperhaps the Moon or even Mars has identified that research into psychological effects of\nremoteness must also be addressed. Studies directed towards this goal have commenced\non ISS flights [42], and this is a clear area for further research.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThanks are due to Professor Stephen Gabriel for compiling material for this chapter.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Rauschenback, H.

Swinerd\n\nAeronautics and Astronautics, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment,\nUniversity of Southampton\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThis chapter serves as a general introduction to the subject of the dynamics of bodies and\nsets a framework for the subjects of celestial mechanics and attitude control (Chapters 4\nand 9). For both of these, Newtonian dynamics will provide a sufficient means of fore-\ncasting and of understanding a spacecraft\u2019s behaviour. The summary presented here is\nchosen with a view to its relevance to spacecraft.\n\nThe approach adopted is to develop an understanding of dynamics in two stages. The\nfirst is to express the dynamics of both translation and rotation in terms of the appropriate\nform of momentum\u2014linear or angular. Momentum becomes an important concept, in\nterms of which it is relatively easy to determine the consequences of forces or moments.\n\nThe second stage is to interpret the momenta in terms of the physical movement\u2014the\nvelocities, linear and angular. This is straightforward for linear momentum since momen-\ntum and velocity are in the same direction. The relationship between rotational movement\nand angular momentum is less intuitive.\n\n3.1.1 Translation/rotation separation\n\nOne feature that is peculiar to spacecraft is that their translational (trajectory) motion is\nvirtually independent of their rotational motion. This is due to the fact that the moments\nor torques that cause their rotation are not dependent upon their direction of travel, and\nthe gravitational forces that determine their trajectory are not dependent on their attitude.\nWhilst this is not entirely true, it is approximately so, and spacecraft designers will\nnormally aim to preserve this independence.\n\nAt a fundamental level it is convenient to think of a spacecraft as being a collection of\nparticles and bodies that lie within a closed surface S (Figure 3.1). This concept allows\nthe surface to be chosen at one\u2019s convenience, to embrace the complete craft or just part\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n50 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nClosed\nsurface S\n\nvC\n\nC\n\nFigure 3.1 The closed surface S\n\nof it or, when considering a docking manoeuvre or a tethered configuration, it may be\nchosen to embrace more than just the one spacecraft. But for the following, assume that\nit envelops just one spacecraft, unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe dynamics of the craft (or whatever is within the surface S ) may now be described\nin terms of its momenta\u2014its linear momentum L and its angular momentum H\u2014the\nformer leading to equations that describe the trajectory and the latter leading to equations\nthat describe the attitude motion.\n\nIn particular, it is the centre-of-mass C whose trajectory will be described. It may\nseem to be pedantic to pick on one specific point for this purpose, but the centre-of-mass\nhas special properties that lead to it being chosen for the development of Newtonian\ndynamics, properties that make it sensible to separate the motion into\n\n1. the motion of the centre-of-mass, C and\n2. the motion relative to the centre-of-mass.\n\nFor highly specialized purposes, such as when using the orbit to improve man\u2019s knowl-\nedge of the geoid, the accuracy with which the orbit is determined may be less than the\ndimensions of the spacecraft, and then it is no longer pedantic to consider to which point\nof the vehicle its orbit refers.\n\n3.1.2 The centre-of-mass, C\n\nThe centre-of-mass of the particles in S , relative to an arbitrary point O , is the point\nwhose position vector rOC obeys\n\nM rOC =\n?\n\n(mrOP ) (3.1)\n\nwhere\nrOP is the position vector of a general particle P (see Figure 3.2),\n\nm is the mass of the general particle\nand M is the total mass within S .\n\nWhen the location of C is being determined for a spacecraft, then it is useful to note\nthat equation (3.1) can be applied to objects such as items of equipment rather than to\nparticles. In that case, rOP refers to the centre-of-mass of the item and m is its mass.\n\n\n\nTRAJECTORY DYNAMICS 3.2 51\n\nrOP\n\nrOC\n\nO\n\nC\n\nS\n\nPm\n\nFigure 3.2 The centre-of-mass, C\n\nWhen an object has a continuous mass distribution, the integral equivalent of\nequation (3.1) should be used, this being\n\nM rOC =\n?\n\nrOP dm (3.2)\n\nIn the development of the theory of dynamics the centre-of-mass C is useful as an origin\nor reference point for the particles in S . Putting the origin there leads to rOC = 0, and\nso equations (3.1) and (3.2) become\n\n?\n(mrCP ) = 0 and\n\n?\nrCP dm = 0 (3.3)\n\nSince this is true at all times, its derivatives are also zero, leading to\n\n?\n(mvCP ) = 0 and\n\n?\nvCP dm = 0 (3.4)\n\nwhere vCP is the velocity of a particle at P relative to the centre-of-mass C .\n\n3.2 TRAJECTORY DYNAMICS\n\nFor trajectory purposes, it is convenient to treat a spacecraft as a particle, as is done in\nChapters 4 and 5.\n\nThis equivalent particle (e.p.) has mass M equal to that of the spacecraft and is situated\nat its centre-of-mass C . Therefore, the e.p. moves with the velocity of C and its momentum\nL is the aggregate of all the particles and bodies that comprise the spacecraft (Figure 3.3),\n\nMomentum L = M vC (3.5)\n\nThis interpretation admits the possibility that the spacecraft may have moving parts or\nappendages. The surface S (Figure 3.1) may in fact be chosen to embrace any objects\nwhose joint orbit(s) are of interest, although it will here refer to a single spacecraft or\ncelestial body unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n52 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nM\n\nC\n\nL = M vC\n\nFigure 3.3 The equivalent particle at C\n\nAccording to Newtonian mechanics\u2014of a single particle\u2014the only way of changing\nits momentum L is to apply a force. For a spacecraft\u2014whose e.p. represents many\nparticles\u2014there are two ways:\n\n1. Application of external forces . These include gravitational attraction towards the\nheavenly bodies, solar radiation pressure, aerodynamic forces and so on.\n\nInternal forces, acting between any two particles or bodies within S , will not produce\nany change in the total momentum. It follows that objects moving within a spacecraft, such\nas fuel, astronauts, mechanisms or flexing structures and so on, will not cause the total\nlinear momentum to change. Likewise, the total momentum of two docking spacecraft\nwill not be changed by any forces between them.\n\nThis mechanism applies to a spacecraft that has no propulsion; its characteristic is that\nthe mass M remains constant.\n\n2. Ejection of some of the particles from within S . This occurs during rocket propulsion.\nThe ejected particles take away both their mass and their momentum, leading to a change\nin the residual mass and momentum of the spacecraft.\nIn the above text it is important to recognize that the momentum must in all cases involve\nthe velocity relative to inertial space rather than to the spacecraft.\n\nIt is convenient to deal separately with the two cases above, that is, with and\nwithout propulsion.\n\n3.2.1 Translational motion with no propulsion\n\nThe effect of external forces Fext on the momentum can be forecast from a diagram such\nas Figure 3.4. Their effect will depend upon not only the magnitude and direction of the\nforces but also upon the magnitude of the momentum L when the forces act. The additional\nmomentum ?L produced during an interval of time ?t is the additional momentum\n\n?L = Fext?t (3.6)\n\nThis must be added vectorially as shown in Figure 3.4 in order to see the effect upon\nthe momentum L during the time interval.\n\nEquation (3.6) may be written as the Newtonian equation:\n\ndL/dt = d(M vC )/dt = Fext (3.7)\n\n\n\nTRAJECTORY DYNAMICS 3.2 53\n\nL at t\n\ndL = Fext dtL\n at t +\n\n dt\n\nFigure 3.4 The incremental increase in momentum caused by an external force\n\n T\n\n0\n  \n\n Fy\n\n Fx\n\n \n\ny\n\nFigure 3.5 The force components along and normal to the trajectory\n\nTo establish the effect that an external force has upon the motion, it is best to resolve\nthe force into two components\u2014Fx along the trajectory and Fy at right angles to it\u2014as\nshown in Figure 3.5. Then\n\n1. Fx along the trajectory will change only the magnitude of the momentum, and hence\nonly the speed\u2014from v0 to vT say\u2014where\n\nM (vT ? v0) =\n? T\n\n0\nFx dt (3.8)\n\n2. Fy normal to the trajectory will change only the direction of the momentum. The\nrate at which the direction changes is d?/dt = Fy/Mv , and so a change of direction\nis best effected when the speed is least, such as at an apoapsis. If the speed remains\nconstant (Fx = 0), then during a time interval from t = 0 to T, the trajectory will\nturn as in Figure 3.5, through an angle (?T ? ?0), where\n\nMv(?T ? ?0) =\n? T\n\n0\nFy dt (3.9)\n\nIf Fy is constant, then the trajectory is an arc of a circle.\n\nIn Section 3.3.2, it will be seen that angular momentum H responds to a torque T in\nexactly the same way as linear momentum L responds to a force F; this also applies to the\nmoment-of-momentum M hI in response to a force whose moment is MI (Section 3.2.3).\n\n3.2.2 Moment-of-momentum mh and angular momentum H\n\nMoment-of-momentum is a useful concept in celestial mechanics (Section 4.2 of\nChapter 4). It is also a useful stepping stone towards angular momentum and the study\nof attitude motion.\n\n\n\n54 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nMass, m\n\nO\nr\n\nL = mv\n\nFigure 3.6 The situation leading to equation (3.10)\n\nThe moment-of-momentum mhO referred to a point O may be defined as\n\nmhO = r \u00d7 mv (3.10)\n\nr is the position vector from O to any point on the line of action of the momentum vector\nmv (Figure 3.6) and v is the velocity relative to the reference point O . This definition is\nequivalent to the product of the momentum with the perpendicular distance from O to\nthe momentum vector.\n\nFor the orbit of (the e.p. of) a spacecraft whose mass is M , it is useful to take the centre\nof gravitational attraction\u2014the centre of the Earth for Earth orbits, for example\u2014as the\nreference point, O say. Then the moment-of-momentum vector M hO will be normal to\nthe orbit plane (Figure 3.7).\n\nIn the study of attitude dynamics, the aggregate of all the moments of the momenta of\nthe particles comprising the spacecraft is a useful concept and it is defined as the angular\nmomentum , H. In this case the most useful reference point is the centre-of-mass, C . This\nsubject is covered in Section 3.3.1.\n\nNote that \u2018moment-of-momentum\u2019 M hO is often loosely referred to as \u2018angular momen-\ntum\u2019 HO . This can lead to some confusion. Only in special cases are the two identical,\nsuch as when there is only one particle. In the more general case of a spacecraft, its\nangular momentum referred to O is the sum of the moment-of-momentum of its e.p.\nreferred to O and its angular momentum referred to C :\n\nHO = M hO + HC (3.11)\n\nIn practice, HC is very much less than M hO , and it is neglected in orbit studies.\n\nMO dt\n\nMoment-of-momentum M hO\n\nMomentum L\n\nMoment MO\n?dt\n\nO\n\nFigure 3.7 Precession of an orbit\u2019s plane due to a moment MO lying in the plane. Its\nnormal turns towards the direction of the moment vector\n\n\n\nTRAJECTORY DYNAMICS 3.2 55\n\n3.2.3 The rate of change of moment-of-momentum MhO\n\nThe moment-of-momentum of a particle M hO referred to an inertially fixed point O is\nonly changed if the forces on it have a moment MO about O . The relationship may be\nexpressed in the form of the Newtonian equation\n\nd(M hO )/dt = MO (3.12)\n\nThis is also true for the e.p. of a spacecraft.\nThe forces on a spacecraft are conventionally separated into\n\n1. the dominant central gravitational force and\n2. the additional perturbative forces.\n\nThe former acts towards a point O that may be taken to be inertially fixed, such\nas the centre of the Earth for Earth orbiters, and so it contributes nothing towards the\nmoment MO .\n\nThe similarity between equations (3.12) and (3.7) indicates that the moment-of-\nmomentum responds to the moment MO in the same way as linear momentum L responds\nto a force Fext. When this is applied to an orbiting spacecraft, the consequences are\n\n1. The component of MO that is normal to the orbit\u2019s plane\u2014in the same direction as\nM hO \u2014will change the magnitude of the moment-of-momentum but not its direc-\ntion, and so the orbit will remain in the same plane, but will change its shape. (See\nSection 9.4.7 of Chapter 4: Apsidal precession.)\n\n2. The component of MO in the orbit plane\u2014at right angles to the moment-of-\nmomentum M hO \u2014will affect the direction of the normal to the plane, turning\nit towards MO as shown in Figure 3.7. This represents a rotation of the orbital\nplane. The rate of turn ? is given by\n\n? = MO/MhO (3.13)\n\n(See Section 4.4 in Chapter 4: Regression of the line of nodes, for example.)\n\n3.2.4 The impulses\n\nIf a force F acts for only a limited duration\u2014from t = 0 to ? , say\u2014then its impulse I\nis defined as\n\nI =\n? ?\n\n0\nF dt (3.14)\n\nFrom equation (3.6) it may be seen that I = L? ? L0, so that an impulse is equal to the\nchange in momentum that it causes .\n\nThe impulse is used in situations in which there is an insignificant amount of movement\nduring the time that the force acts. A collision is a common application. The firing of a\nrocket when in Earth orbit may also occur over a very small orbital arc, and if so then\nit may be treated as an impulse. A swing-by manoeuvre in heliocentric space is another\n\n\n\n56 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\napplication since the passage through the sphere of influence of a planet involves very\nlittle movement in the heliocentric orbit (see Chapter 5).\n\nA torque impulse IT is defined in terms of torque T in a manner similar to\nequation (3.14).\n\nIT =\n? ?\n\n0\nT dt (3.15)\n\nSince the relationship between torque T and angular momentum H (equation 3.28) is\nidentical to that between force F and linear momentum L (equation 3.7), it follows that\nIT = H? ? H0, so that a torque impulse is equal to the change in angular momentum that\nit causes .\n\nThe restriction that there is little movement\u2014angular in this case\u2014during the torque\nimpulse means that collisions and landing impacts are the main situations in which the\ntorque may be deemed to be sudden.\n\nIn the case of a body in motion\u2014linear and/or rotational\u2014the impulses are a measure\nof what would cause the motion from an initially stationary state. It follows that the\nnegative of the impulses will bring the body to rest.\n\n3.2.5 Translational motion under propulsion\n\nWhen a rocket motor is fired, there is an expulsion of particles out of the spacecraft\u2014out\nof the surface S referred to above. Each particle of the exhaust gases takes away its\ncontributions to two of the properties of the e.p., its mass M and its momentum M vC \u2014the\ntotal momentum within S .\n\nIf the rocket\u2019s mass flow is ? , then this is the rate at which the mass of the e.p.\ndecreases, that is,\n\ndM /dt = ?? (3.16)\n\nAlso, the absolute velocity of the exhaust is (vC + vex), and so the rate at which the\nmomentum of the e.p. changes is\n\nd(M vC )/dt = ??(vC + vex) (3.17)\n\nHere vex is the exhaust velocity relative to the centre-of-mass, taken to be positive in the\ndirection of travel.\n\nIn the general case there will be an external force Fext acting in addition, part of this\nbeing due to the back-pressure if the rocket operates in an atmosphere. Then the total rate\nof increase of momentum obeys the Newtonian equation\n\nd(M vC )/dt = Fext ? ?(vC + vex) (3.18)\n\nFrom equations (3.16) and (3.18) it follows that the absolute acceleration aC of the\ne.p. obeys\n\nM aC = Fext ? ?vex (3.19)\n\nClearly when the rocket is restrained, as on a test bed, there will be no acceleration,\nand the restraining force Fext will be equal to the thrust, ?vex.\n\n\n\nTRAJECTORY DYNAMICS 3.2 57\n\nv\n\n?v\n\nFigure 3.8 Possible changes of velocity due to a rocket\u2019s ?v\n\nThe rocket equation is the integral of equation (3.19) for the case of no external forces,\nand the thruster points in a constant direction. The velocity increment ?v due to the burn\nis then\n\n?v = ?vex ln(M0/M1) (3.20)\n\nM0/M1 is the mass ratio, the ratio between the masses M0 before and M1 after the burn.\nEquation (3.20) is frequently used as an approximation when the burn is short enough\n\nthat it may be considered to be impulsive. Then, by pointing the rocket in different\ndirections, it may be used to achieve an increase or decrease in speed, or a change\nof direction or any combination that is consistent with the vector diagram shown in\nFigure 3.8.\n\nA course change ?? , for example, without any change of speed, will occur if the\ninitial and final velocity vectors in Figure 3.8 form an isosceles triangle with ?v as base.\nThe angle turned through will be\n\n?? = 2 arcsin ( 12 |?v|/v) (3.21)\nand the thrust needs to be directed at an angle (90 + ?/2) degrees to the initial direction\nof travel. An assumption above is that the thrust vector passes through the centre-of-mass.\nIf this is not so, then its moment about this point will produce a possible course change\n(see Section 3.3.2).\n\n3.2.6 Translational kinetic energy\n\nAn energy equation may be obtained as the first integral of equation (3.7), and this\nrelationship can be very useful in the subject of celestial mechanics.\n\nThe translational kinetic energy may be expressed as\n\nKE = 12 Mv 2C or 12 M vC \u00b7vC or 12 L\u00b7vC (3.22)\nThe change in this is equal to the work done by the external forces Fext, and it may be\n\nexpressed as\n\n?KE = ? ( 12 M vC \u00b7vC ) =\n?\n\nFext \u00b7 ds (3.23)\n\nwhere ds is the incremental change in position (see Figure 3.9).\n\n\n\n58 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nFext\n\nds\n\nvc\n\nFigure 3.9 Vectors used in definition of translational kinetic energy\n\nThe conservative forces may be separated from the non-conservative ones since the\nformer\u2019s contribution to the integral may be expressed in terms of potential energy (PE).\nThe resulting energy equation becomes\n\n?KE + ?PE =\n?\n\nFnc \u00b7 ds (3.24)\n\nwhere Fnc is the non-conservative contribution to the total external force Fext.\nWhen the only force on the spacecraft is that due to gravitational attraction, a conser-\n\nvative force whose potential energy is ?? M/r , then the orbital energy equation becomes\n\n1\n2 M vC \u00b7 vC ? ? M/r = constant (3.25)\n\n3.3 GENERAL ATTITUDE DYNAMICS\n\nTrajectory dynamics supplies rules governing the motion of the centre-of-mass C relative\nto some inertially fixed frame of reference. Attitude dynamics on the other hand uses the\ncentre-of-mass C as a reference point.\n\nIn terms of momentum, attitude dynamics is mathematically identical to trajectory\ndynamics. That is to say angular momentum H responds to a torque T in exactly the\nsame way as linear momentum L does to a force F. But the physical motions associated\nwith the two types of momentum are quite different.\n\nIn order to establish the fundamental principles in terms of momentum, it is convenient\nto refer once more to the closed surface S (Figure 3.1), the boundary that separates\nparticles that are of interest from those that are not. These results are then quite general,\nincluding spacecraft with fluids and moving parts as well as the important cases of a\nrigid body and multiple bodies; the rules for the physical motions of the latter are dealt\nwith later.\n\n3.3.1 Angular momentum H\n\nThe angular momentum HO referred to a point O is defined as the aggregate of the\nmoments of the momenta of all the particles within S . In mathematical terms, angular\nmomentum referred to O is defined as\n\nHO =\n?\n\n(r \u00d7 mv) (3.26)\n\n\n\nGENERAL ATTITUDE DYNAMICS 3.3 59\n\nC\n\nO\n\nr\n\nL = MvcLinear momentum\n\nHc\n\nAngular m\nomentum\n\nreferred to\n C\n\nHo = Hc + (r \u00d7 L)\n\nFigure 3.10 Transfer of reference point from C to O\n\nwhere both r and v are relative to O . It is a product of rotation in much the same way as\nlinear momentum is a product of translation.\n\nIn physical terms the angular momentum of a rigid body is a measure of the torque\nimpulse that is needed to create its rotational motion. Thus the rotation of a body will\nbe brought to rest by the application of a torque impulse that is equal and opposite to its\nangular momentum H.\n\nThe reference point that is most useful for attitude dynamics is the centre-of-mass C . For\nexample, the rotational motion of a spacecraft is normally derived from equation (3.28),\nusing its momentum HC referred to its centre-of-mass.\n\nThe rule governing the transfer of reference point from C to some other point O is\n\nHO = HC + M hO = HC + (r \u00d7 M r?) (3.27)\n\nFigure 3.10 illustrates the terms used. The transfer involves adding on the moment-of-\nmomentum of the e.p., a process similar to the transfer of inertia from C to O (Appendix,\nequation 3.A9). Equation (3.27) could be used, for example, for expressing the contribu-\ntion to a spacecraft\u2019s total angular momentum referred to its centre-of-mass, which arises\nfrom a momentum wheel (see also equation 3.35).\n\n3.3.2 Rate of change of angular momentum, H\n\nThe following explanation applies only when the reference point is the centre-of-mass C\nor an inertially fixed point I . It does not apply for other points.\n\nThe angular momentum may be changed in two ways, the first being\n\n\u2022 by applying an external couple or a force that has a moment about the reference\npoint. The term \u2018external torque\u2019 (T) will be used as a general term to cover both of\nthese. Its consequence is a rate of change of H, referred to C or I , described by the\nNewtonian equation\n\nd(H)/dt = T (3.28)\n\nInternal torques, acting between particles or bodies, will not change the total momen-\ntum. Thus mechanisms, fuel movement and so on will not change the total angular\nmomentum of a spacecraft. Similarly, the forces between two docking spacecraft will\nnot affect their combined angular momentum.\n\n\n\n60 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nThere is an important consequence for spacecraft designers since there will always be\nnaturally occurring external disturbance torques (see Section 9.4 of Chapter 9). Their\nmean level will therefore cause a progressive build-up of the angular momentum over\nthe lifetime of the craft. The rotational motion associated with this could be quite\nunacceptable. It follows that spacecraft must be fitted with means of controlling this\nbuild-up, and only external torquers are capable of doing so.\n\nThe second means of changing H is\n\n\u2022 by the ejection from S of some particles whose momenta have moments about\nthe reference point. This will occur during the firing of rockets, when their thrust\nvector does not pass precisely through the centre-of-mass. An analysis of this process\nwill not be covered in this book. (A procedure similar to that used above in the\ndevelopment of equations (3.16), (3.17) and (3.20) can be followed if required.)\n\nEquation (3.28) takes the same form as equation (3.7), and so the effect that a torque\nT has upon angular momentum H is the same as the effect that a force F has upon linear\nmomentum L, stated as follows:\n\n1. The component of a torque T that is in the same direction as the angular momentum\nH will change only the magnitude of the momentum.\n\n2. The component TN of the torque T that is at right angles to the angular momentum\nH will cause it to change direction towards the torque T.\nIn this case, the torque impulse during a small interval of time ?t is TN ?t and is\nthe change in the angular momentum during this time (see equation 3.15). This is\nshown in Figure 3.11.\n\nThe best-known physical illustration of this is the precession of a gyroscope. From\nFigure 3.11 it may be seen that the rate of precession is\n\nd?/dt = TN /H (3.29)\n\nAs the angular momentum H becomes very large, the effect of a torque impulse becomes\nless, leading to the property known as gyroscopic rigidity .\n\nThis characteristic is made use of by spacecraft designers when they give their craft\nmomentum bias , as a means of making the bias direction insensitive to disturbance torques.\nMaking H large causes the precession rate to become small in response to a given torque.\n\nThe rate of change of the components of H depends upon the rotation of the axis system\nchosen, in addition to the change described by the Newtonian equation (3.28). When the\n\ndy\n\nH\n\nTNdt\n\nFigure 3.11 Precession due to an external torque\n\n\n\nGENERAL ATTITUDE DYNAMICS 3.3 61\n\naxis system has an angular velocity ? relative to inertial space, then equation (3.28) must\nbe interpreted using the Coriolis theorem, as\n\nd(HC )/dt = d/dtcompts(HC ) + (? \u00d7 HC ) = T (3.30)\n\nwhere d/dtcompts( ) means the rate of change of the components of ( ).\nThis equation is used in the remainder of this chapter in order to develop the scalar\n\ndynamic equations for the rotational motion of spacecraft.\n\n3.3.3 Angular momentum of rigid bodies\n\nThe angular momentum of a rigid body may be expressed in terms of its angular velocity\n?. The angular momentum equations given above can then be used to develop equations\nin ? that describe the attitude and rotational motion of such a body, and of systems made\nup of rigid bodies.\n\nThe angular momentum HC of a single rigid body referred to its centre-of-mass C may\nbe expressed as\n\nHC = [IC ]? (3.31)\n\nwhere ? is its angular velocity relative to an inertial (non-rotating) frame of reference\nand [IC ] is the inertia matrix based upon the centre-of-mass C .\n\nIn general, [IC ] may be expressed as\n\n[IC ] =\n?\n? Ixx ?Ixy ?Izx?Ixy Iyy ?Iyz\n\n?Izx ?Iyz Izz\n\n?\n? (3.32)\n\nwhere Ixx , Iyy and Izz are the moments of inertia.\nIxy , Iyz and Izx are the products of inertia, broadly representing a measure of the lack\n\nof mass symmetry, leading to cross-coupled behaviour, as will be seen later.\nThe Appendix to this chapter contains a full treatment of the subject of the inertia\n\nmatrix, including the dependency of the elements upon the choice of axes. It is sufficient\nto record here that every body has a set of orthogonal axes at each point, for which the\nproducts of inertia are zero. These are called principal axes , and there may well be more\nthan one set of them, depending upon the mass symmetry of the body. Principal axes are\neigenvectors of the inertia matrix.\n\nIt is evident from equation (3.31) that the components of the angular momentum may\nin general be expressed as\n\nHC =\n?\n?(Ixx?x ? Ixy?y ? Izx ?z )(Iyy?y ? Iyz ?z ? Ixy?x )\n\n(Izz ?z ? Izx?x ? Iyz ?y )\n\n?\n? (3.33)\n\nWhen principal axes are used, then\n\nHC = {Ixx?x , Iyy?y , Izz ?z }T (3.34)\n\n\n\n62 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nIt is usual to develop the rotational equations for a body by choosing axes in which the\ninertias are constant. Axes fixed in the body will always achieve this, but there are other\noptions if there is a mass symmetry. For example, a spinning object that has cylindrical\nmass symmetry about its spin axis, such as a typical wheel, will have constant inertias in\nnon-spinning coordinate axes.\n\nThe angular momentum of a rigid body with spinning wheels , such as a spacecraft fitted\nwith momentum or reaction wheels, can be expressed as the sum of the angular momentum\nof the rigid body containing the wheels in their non-spinning state (equations 3.33 or 3.34),\ntogether with the extra momentum due to the angular velocities of the wheels relative to\nthe body .\n\nFor example, suppose a spacecraft is fitted with a wheel that is spinning with an\nangular velocity ?wh relative to the craft. The vector ?wh will be along the wheel\u2019s axis\nof symmetry, which will be in a fixed direction in the spacecraft\u2019s axes. If its moment of\ninertia about its own axis is Iwh, then an additional angular momentum equal to Iwh?wh\nmust be added to that of the spacecraft\u2019s body. If there are several wheels and as a whole\nthey contribute the additional momentum components {Hx , Hy , Hz }T, say, then the total\nangular momentum of the body plus wheels becomes\n\nHC =\n?\n?Ixx?x ? Ixy?y ? Izx?z + HxIyy?y ? Iyz ?z ? Ixy?x + Hy\n\nIzz ?z ? Izx?x ? Iyz ?y + Hz\n\n?\n? (3.35)\n\nIf the body\u2019s principal axes are used, then this becomes\n\nHC = {(Ixx ?x + Hx ), (Iyy?y + Hy ), (Izz ?z + Hz )}T (3.36)\n\nMultiple rigid bodies of a more general nature need to be addressed in order to deal with\nthe docking manoeuvre, ejecting payloads from a launcher\u2019s cargo bay, astronauts repair-\ning spacecraft, tethered spacecraft and so on and indeed to the Earth/Moon combination.\nFor these multi-body situations, each separate body will obey the dynamic equations that\nare stated elsewhere in this chapter. But it is worth noting that their combined momenta\nwill not be changed by any forces or moments of interaction between them, and so will\nnot be affected by a collision, separation or tethering. This applies to their absolute linear\nmomentum, and also to the angular momentum about their combined centre-of-mass, C .\n\nFor example, consider two bodies with masses M1, M2, as in Figure 3.12, and total\nmass M . Assume that their centres-of-mass at C1, C2 have absolute velocities v1, v2 and\nthat referring to these, they have angular momenta H1, H2.\n\nThen, during a collision or separation or due to a tether\n\n\u2022 their total absolute linear momentum remains constant, so\n\nM vC = M1v1 + M2v2 remains constant (3.37)\n\n\u2022 their angular momenta referred to C remains constant, so\n\nHC = (M1M2/M )(r12 \u00d7 v12) + H1 + H2 remains constant (3.38)\n\nwhere r12, v12 are the position and velocity vectors of C2 relative to C1.\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MOTION OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF SPACECRAFT 3.4 63\n\nvc\n\nH2\nH1\n\nv2\n\nv1\n\nM1\n\nM2\nr12\n\nC1\n\nC2\n\nC\n\nFigure 3.12 The combined momenta of two rigid bodies\n\nThese conservation of momentum laws also apply to the erection of solar arrays and\nso on, and when using pointing mechanisms.\n\n3.3.4 Rotational kinetic energy\n\nThe rotational energy of a rigid body may be expressed as\n\nE = 12 (HC \u00b7?) or 12 ([IC ]? \u00b7 ?) (3.39)\n\nThis is additional to the translational energy of the e.p. quoted in equation (3.22).\nWork is done by a torque T at a rate T\u00b7?, and the rate at which the rotational energy is\n\nincreased by a torque TC about C is TC \u00b7?. It follows that in the absence of any external\ntorque TC the rotational energy will remain constant.\n\nWhen the body is not rigid, however, or when there are moving parts, the energy level\ncan change in the absence of any external torque. In a spacecraft there will be internal\ndissipative mechanisms such as flexure, passive nutation dampers and so on that lead\nto the loss of kinetic energy, but at the same time the angular momentum HC remains\nconstant. A notable consequence of this is that the long-term tendency of a spinning body\nis towards spinning about its axis of maximum inertia, this being its minimum-energy\nstate (see Section 3.4.2).\n\n3.4 ATTITUDE MOTION OF SPECIFIC TYPES\n\nOF SPACECRAFT\n\nThe general theory in Section 3.3 may now be applied to specific types of spacecraft. For\nthis purpose it will be assumed that all craft have rigid bodies, and have rigid moving\nparts unless otherwise stated. Whilst the response of their angular momentum to a torque\nis well ordered and straightforward, as explained above, the associated rotational motion\nis by no means necessarily so easily understood.\n\nSpacecraft may be classified for convenience, as shown in Figure 3.13. The main\nsubdivision depends upon whether the spacecraft has momentum bias or not. Bias means\nthat the craft has a significant amount of angular momentum due to the spin of part or all\nof it. It then behaves like a gyroscope, with the associated characteristics of gyroscopic\nrigidity and a precessional type of response to a torque, as described in equation (3.29).\n\n\n\n64 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nSpacecraft\n\nNo bias\n\nThree-axis\nstabilised\n(zero bias)\n\nHybrid Dual-spinner Pure-spinner\n\nWith bias\n\nFigure 3.13 Categories of spacecraft\n\nSome spacecraft may be spun-up for only a short time. It is common practice to do so\nprior to the firing of a high thrust rocket, for example. This is primarily to prevent any\nthrust offset from causing the craft to veer off course, the spin causing the mean path to\nbe straight. Subsequently, the craft will be spun-down to the level of bias that is required\nfor normal operation.\n\nCross-coupling? is an essential feature of precessional response. The precession axis is\nat right angles to the axis of the torque that caused it. It is nevertheless a systematic and\norderly effect. Normally, large cross-couplings are to be avoided so that control about\neach axis can proceed without interfering with the other axes, and vice versa. The rigid\nbody dynamic equations developed in this section enable the sources of cross-couplings\nto be identified.\n\n3.4.1 Three-axes-stabilized spacecraft\n\n(with no momentum bias)\n\nSpacecraft in this class are usually large, with extensive solar arrays. They have a variety\nof different shapes such as the notional one shown in Figure 3.14. Their angular velocity\nis normally small, perhaps one revolution per orbit in order to maintain one face pointing\ntowards Earth. The solar arrays may have even less angular movement, being required to\npoint towards the Sun, and they may be mounted on a bearing to permit this.\n\nThe craft will be treated as a single rigid body. This is a reasonable approximation for\nthe main structure, but the solar arrays are very flexible (see Section 3.5.2). Nevertheless,\nthe presentation brings out some important points that are relevant to the \u2018rigid body\u2019\nresponses of these craft.\n\nUsing principal axes that are fixed in the body, their angular velocity ? will be that of\nthe body, ?. Inserting HC from equation (3.34) into equation (3.30) leads to\n\n? \u2018Cross-coupling\u2019 here means that a cause about one axis, such as a torque about the pitch axis, produces a\nresponse about another axis\u2014the yaw axis, for example\u2014and vice versa. (In electrical circuits it implies an\nundesired effect.)\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MOTION OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF SPACECRAFT 3.4 65\n\nIxx ??x ? (Iyy ? Izz )?y?z = Tx\nIyy ??y ? (Izz ? Ixx )?z ?x = Ty\nIzz ??z ? (Ixx ? Iyy)?x ?y = Tz\n\n??\n? (3.40)\n\nFrom these equations it may be seen that cross-coupling will potentially be present in\nattitude control systems (ACS) for a variety of reasons. The term is used when the\nacceleration in response to a torque does not take place solely about the torque axis.\n\nFor an initially stationary spacecraft a torque about a principal axis will produce a\nresponse about this axis, without any cross-coupling into the other axes. The response is\nan angular acceleration given by\n\n??x = Tx/Ixx (3.41)\n\nSince torquers produce couples, their axes do not need to pass through the centre-of-\nmass, C .\n\nIn the more general case, when there are products of inertia, the initial acceleration\nfrom rest will be\n\n?? = [IC ]?1T (3.42)\n\nCross-coupling will occur, and if a pure response ??x is required, then potentially all three\ntorquers must be used.\n\nCross-coupled motion will also result if the x -component of torque is used when there\nis already an angular rate about the y- or z -axes. It must be assessed when a repointing\nmanoeuvre is needed. It may be that the manoeuvre will best be carried out as a sequence\nof separate rotations about the principal axes, but there are a number of possible routes\nthat may be taken in changing from one attitude to another.\n\nIn the absence of any external torque, a stationary spacecraft with no bias will remain\nin that condition indefinitely. Once it is rotating, its motion may become divergent. The\nstability of rotating motion is dealt with in Section 3.4.2.\n\nC\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\nFigure 3.14 The three-axis-stabilized spacecraft\n\n\n\n66 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\n3.4.2 Pure-spin spacecraft\n\nWhen the whole of the spacecraft structure spins, it has angular momentum. At very low\nvalues this leads to minor cross-couplings such as are mentioned above. But when the\nmomentum becomes large and deliberate it is called momentum bias , and then the cross-\ncouplings become so great that the behaviour needs to be looked at afresh. The behaviour\nof the spacecraft becomes like that of a gyroscope rotor, or usually its designer would\nlike it to be so. This will only be achieved if he observes constraints upon the choice of\nspin axis and upon the mass distribution, as indicated below.\n\nThe choice of spin axis is important. From the mission designer\u2019s point of view this\naxis will be the direction of the momentum bias, gyroscopically rigid as described in\nSection 3.3.2, and so it is ideally orientated in a direction that is not required to change\nduring the mission\u2014normal to the orbit plane, for example. But the dynamics of the\nspacecraft requires that constraints on the mass distribution are observed.\n\nIf a body is spinning with angular velocity ?, then the spin axis will not in general\nremain in a fixed direction in space. It is the angular momentum HC that has the fixed\ndirection. If it is required that ? is also fixed, then it follows that it must be aligned with\nHC , that is, [IC ]?. This can only happen if the spin axis is along an eigenvector of the\ninertia matrix, which is to say that the spin must take place about a principal axis.\n\nIf rotation is initiated about some axis other than a principal axis, then the physical\nbehaviour depends upon a number of factors. In general, the angular velocity vector varies\nin direction and magnitude. The motion may be anything from an untidy tumbling type\nof motion to an oscillatory coning motion, depending upon the magnitudes of the initial\nrotation, the departure of its axis from a principal axis and the disparity between the\ninertias. When faced with this type of behaviour, and also the instabilities referred to in\nthe following paragraphs, it is difficult to believe that the angular momentum vector HC\nis fixed in magnitude and direction.\n\nThe stability of a spinning body may be explored by using equation (3.40), with no\ntorque components present. It will be assumed here that the spin is about the z -axis and\nhas a rate ?z = S , consistent with Figure 3.15. Two of equations (3.40) then become\n\nIxx ??x ? (Iyy ? Izz )S ?y = 0\nand\n\nIyy ??y ? (Izz ? Ixx )S ?x = 0\n(3.43)\n\nThese are linear equations whose characteristic equation in terms of the Laplace\noperator, s , is\n\ns2 + (1 ? Izz /Ixx )(1 ? Izz /Iyy)S 2 = 0 (3.44)\n\nIt may be seen that for the spinning motion to be stable, Izz must be the maximum or\nthe least of the moments of inertia.\n\nBodies that are designed to spin will normally have a mass distribution that is axisym-\nmetric, meaning that Ixx = Iyy . The moments of inertia about all radii through C then\nhave this same value.\n\nThere are many examples of such axially symmetric spinning bodies. Gyroscope rotors,\nvehicle wheels, propellers and so on spin about their axes of maximum inertia.

If they spin about their axis of least inertia, they will be stable in the short\nterm only. Their long-term behaviour will be unstable if there is a loss of rotational\nenergy brought about by internal dissipation rather than by an external torque. They\nwill eventually adopt a cartwheeling type of motion\u2014a spin motion about the axis of\nmaximum inertia. During this process the angular momentum HC remains constant, whilst\nthe energy 12 HC \u00b7 ? decreases, and it follows that the motion must move towards the\nminimum-energy state in which ? is least. With [IC ]? remaining constant, this means\nthat it moves towards rotation about an axis of maximum inertia.\n\nThus it follows that spacecraft that are pure-spinners will spin about their axis of\nmaximum moment of inertia.\n\nThe effect of a torque T is to change the angular momentum HC , as explained in\nSection 3.3. For the physical response its effect upon the angular velocity ? is required,\nand the appropriate equations may be obtained by inserting HC in the form [IC ]? into\nequation (3.30).\n\nIn the following analysis it will be assumed that the spacecraft is initially spinning\nabout its z -axis, a principal axis of maximum or least inertia. When this is the only\nangular motion, the craft is in a state of equilibrium, stable at least in the short term, as\nshown above.\n\nRepointing of the spin axis will normally call for a rotation about an axis that is at\nright angles to the spin axis and that is fixed in space rather than fixed in the rotating\nstructure. Coordinate axes that are convenient for the analysis are therefore non-spinning\nones with the z -axis aligned with the spin axis. These axes have their angular velocity\nz -component equal to zero at all times, so that during a manoeuvre the angular velocity\nwill be ? = {?x , ?y , 0}T .\n\nThe spacecraft spins at a rate {0, 0, S }T relative to the coordinate axes, and so its angular\nvelocity ? is {?x , ?y , S }T.\n\nThe inertia matrix [IC ] referred to the coordinate axes has elements that are in gen-\neral changing. If the moments of inertia referred to the spacecraft\u2019s principal axes are\n\n\n\n68 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\n{Ixx , Iyy , Izz } and these axes are at an angle ? to the coordinate axes, where ?? = S , then\nthe inertia matrix [IC ] is obtainable from Appendix equation (3.A10):\n\n[IC ] =\n?\n?(I+ ?

A torque T z about the z-axis causes a simple acceleration S? about that axis when\nthe spacecraft is in its equilibrium state. Note that in this state ?x and ?y are zero, so\n\nS? = Tz /Izz (3.48)\n\n2. Repointing the spin axis by means of a constant precession rate ?y about the y-axis,\nsay, will require a torque Tx about the x -axis. Only if the moments of inertia Ixx and Iyy\nare equal, that is, (I? = 0), will the torque be constant. Under this condition,\n\n?y = Tx/Izz S (3.49)\n\nFor example, a spacecraft with a moment of inertia of 400 kg m2, spinning at 10 rpm, will\nprecess at about 0.5 arcsec per second for each newton millimetre of torque.\n\nThis represents complete cross-coupling between x - and y-axes, which is a char-\nacteristic of a gyroscope\u2019s precessional behaviour. But in addition it should be noted\nthat a torque produces an angular velocity rather than the acceleration produced by Tz .\nFigure 3.16(a) shows how the angular momentum HC is rotated towards the torque vector\nT and Figure 3.16(b) shows the total angular velocity, with contributions from ? and ?.\n\nIf Ixx and Iyy differ, then additional oscillating torques will be needed, that is,\n\nTx = 2cSI??y and Ty = 2s SI??y (3.50)\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MOTION OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF SPACECRAFT 3.4 69\n\nTorque Tx Torque Tx\n\nC\n\ny\n\nz\n\nTdt\n\nHc\n\nDirection move\nment of Hc\n\n(a) (b)\n\nSpin w\n\nPrecession\nTotal\nangular\nvelocity\n\ny\n\n?\n\n?\n\nFigure 3.16 Precession of a pure-spinner due to a torque\n\nFurthermore, if a constant rate of spin S is to be maintained, then a torque will be needed,\nwhich is equal to\n\nTz = ?s I??2y (3.51)\n\nFailure to provide these oscillating torques will lead to an unsteady precession in response\nto a constant torque Tx . Most objects that are designed to spin will be given axial mass\nsymmetry, that is, I? = 0, or Ixx = Iyy , and this applies to spacecraft too.\n\nIt should be noted that the components Tx and Ty are in non-spinning axes and that\ntorquers fixed in the spacecraft will need to apply resolved versions of Tx , Ty , that is,\n\nTorque components\nin spacecraft axes\n\n=\n?\n? cos ? sin ? 0? sin ? cos ? 0\n\n0 0 1\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?TxTy\n\nTz\n\n?\n? (3.52)\n\n3. There is an oscillatory \u2018nutation\u2019 mode. This appears as a coning type of motion\nwhen the spacecraft is disturbed from its equilibrium state. Whenever precessional torques\nare applied, the mode will be activated; additional activation will occur when the torque\nceases. If the duration of the precession is equal to an exact number of nutation peri-\nods, then the torque cessation will cancel the nutation, but engineered damping may be\nnecessary (see Section 3.5.1).\n\nIt may already be seen from the characteristic equation (3.43) that an oscillatory mode\nexists, the frequency of which is\n\n?nut = S\n?\n\n(1 ? Izz /Ixx )(1 ? Izz /Iyy) (3.53)\n\nThis is the frequency that may be observed on traces from rate gyroscopes that are\nmounted on the structure, that is, when it is observed in the spinning axes.\n\nIn the axisymmetric case, Izz /Ixx lies in the range 1 ? Izz /Ixx < 2. The observed nuta-\ntion frequency will depend upon the rate at which the observer is spinning.\n\n\n\n70 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nWhen viewed from the (spinning) spacecraft frame of reference, as measured by instru-\nments that are fixed to the spacecraft\u2019s structure, for example,\n\n?nut = S ((Izz /Ixx ) ? 1), and so 0 ? ?nut < S (3.54)\n\nWhen viewed from a non-spinning (inertial) frame of reference,\n\n?nut = S (Izz /Ixx ), and so S ? ?nut < 2S (3.55)\n\n3.4.3 Hybrid and dual-spin spacecraft\n\nTwo classes of spacecraft bring together the advantages of having momentum bias and\nyet provide a non-spinning base for accommodation of payload elements and torquers.\nThese are the dual-spin spacecraft and the hybrid spacecraft. In each case momentum bias\nis provided by mounting a rotating body\u2014or more than one\u2014on the non-spinning part;\nit is part of the structure in the case of the dual-spin spacecraft, but consists of high-speed\npurpose-built wheels\u2014momentum wheels\u2014in the case of the hybrid spacecraft.\n\nThe spinning parts of these types of spacecraft have dynamic properties similar to those\nof the pure-spinner covered above. They will have axially symmetric mass properties for\nthe reasons given. So their centres-of-mass lie on the spin axis, and their moments of\ninertia will be equal about axes normal to this. Their contribution to the total inertia [IC ]\nof the spacecraft will then be independent of their rotation. Their rate of spin will remain\nconstant unless there is a torque about their axis.\n\nThe non-spinning structure will behave like the three-axes-stabilized craft described in\nSection 3.4.1. Some of the torques on it will be applied via the bearings of the rotating\nparts in which there will be built-in torque motors.\n\nThe angular momentum of the hybrid and dual-spin spacecraft is then given by the\nexpressions in equation (3.35) or (3.36). These may be substituted into equation (3.30)\nin order to obtain equations obeyed by the components of the angular velocity of the\nnon-spinning structure, in any coordinate axis.\n\nIf the momentum bias direction is along the z -axis, a principal axis, then\n\nHC = {Ixx?x , Iyy?y , (Izz ?z + Hz )}T (3.56)\n\nThe dynamic equations for the components of angular velocity along principal axes are\n\nIxx ??x + ?y?z (Izz ? Iyy) + ?y Hz = Tx\nIyy ??y + ?z ?x (Ixx ? Izz ) ? ?x Hz = Ty\nIzz ??z + H?z + ?x?y (Iyy ? Ixx ) = Tz\n\n??\n? (3.57)\n\nA number of observations may be made:\n\n1. Stability . The momentum bias axis may be the axis of intermediate inertia without\ncausing instability. The constraint imposed on the pure spinner is not necessary here.\n\nThe long-term stability cannot be forecast from the above equations. The dual-spinner\nwill, however, be stable provided that energy dissipation in the non-spinning part\nexceeds that in the spinning part. The bias direction may then be along the axis of\n\n\n\nOSCILLATORY MODES 3.5 71\n\nleast inertia. Passive nutation dampers, for example, will be placed in the non-spinning\npart of the spacecraft.\n\n2. There is a nutation mode whose frequency, when observed in non-spinning axes, is\n\n?nut = Hz /\n?\n\n(Ixx Iyy ) (3.58)\n\nFor example, a spacecraft having both moments of inertia Ixx and Iyy equal to 400 kg m2,\nand carrying a momentum wheel giving a bias of 40 N m s, will have a nutation mode\nwith a period of about one minute.\n\n3. The response to a torque. The inclusion of momentum bias makes the whole structure\nbehave as a gyrostat, with a response that is very similar to that of a spinner. A constant\ntorque about the x -axis will cause a constant rate of precession about the y-axis, for\nexample, the magnitude of which is\n\n?y = Tx/Hz (3.59)\n\nThus a torque of 1 N mm will produce a rate of precession of about 5 s of arc per second\nwhen the bias is 40 N m s. On the other hand a torque about the bias direction will\nproduce an angular acceleration about that direction if it is parallel to a principal axis. In\nother cases there will be cross-coupling.\n\n3.5 OSCILLATORY MODES\n\nAll vehicles have a tendency to oscillate and vibrate, and spacecraft are no exception. In\ntheir case the damping of the oscillatory modes is less than that experienced by Earthbound\nvehicles, and as a consequence any oscillation, once started, may last for a very long\ntime\u2014a characteristic of modes that are very close to being unstable.\n\nIt follows that it is important that these modes are identified by the designer and that\nartificial damping is introduced by the Attitude and/or Orbit Control system if possible;\ncertainly the modes must not be destabilized. Care must also be taken to avoid exciting\nthose modes whose ultimate damping remains very low.\n\nThe main oscillatory tendencies occur as either \u2018rigid body modes\u2019 or \u2018flexure modes\u2019\nand are addressed below. Fuel movement inside tanks can also have an oscillatory ten-\ndency but this is normally controlled by means of baffles.\n\n3.5.1 Rigid body modes\n\nThere are potentially two rigid body modes, nutation and libration.\nThe nutation mode is present in spacecraft that have momentum bias, whether this is\n\nachieved by spinning the complete structure or part of it or by using a momentum wheel.\nIt is easiest to describe it as follows, when there is just one spinning part.\n\nIn the absence of any torque, the equilibrium state occurs when the axis of the spinning\npart is aligned with the angular momentum vector and they point at the same fixed\ndirection in space. A small torque impulse will cause them to become misaligned, the\nmomentum vector being turned to a new fixed direction. The ensuing nutation oscillation\n\n\n\n72 DYNAMICS OF SPACECRAFT\n\nthen has a pattern of motion in which the spin axis adopts a \u2018coning\u2019 type of behaviour\naround this fixed angular momentum direction.\n\nAt the start of a constant torque causing precession of the momentum bias vector,\nthe step change in the torque will excite the nutation mode and the oscillation will be\nsuperimposed on the precession as shown in Figure 9.7. Further excitation will occur\nwhen the torque ceases; this may be timed so as to cancel the nutation.\n\nA hand-held bicycle wheel may be used to demonstrate nutation. The wheel must be\ncarefully balanced and fitted with a handle that is an extension of its axle. When the\nwheel is spinning rapidly with its axle horizontal, it may be supported by just one finger\nunder the handle, whereupon it will rotate about a vertical axis at a constant rate. This is\nprecession, obeying equation (3.29). If during this motion a sharp impulse is delivered to\nthe handle, then an oscillatory motion will take place (in addition to the precession); this\nis nutation, the observed frequency obeying equation (3.55).\n\nThe libration mode is caused by the gravity gradient\u2014the reduction in the gravitational\nfield strength as the distance from Earth\u2019s centre increases.\n\nA rigid body is in stable equilibrium in this field when its axis of minimum moment\nof inertia lies along the local vertical. The Moon is an example of a body that is roughly\nin this state. When the body in equilibrium is disturbed by a small amount, it will then\noscillate like a conical pendulum if it is free to do so. The frequency of oscillation is\ngiven by equation (9.21) of Chapter 9; at the Earth\u2019s surface its period is about 48 min,\nabout half the period of a satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\n\nA few spacecraft use this phenomenon as a means of achieving an Earth-pointing face,\nand they must then incorporate damping for this mode in their ACS algorithms. (The\nEarth\u2019s tidal system provides damping for the Moon.) In other spacecraft the torques of\nthis mode appear as disturbance torques (see Section 9.4.3 of Chapter 9).\n\n3.5.2 Flexure modes\n\nAll structures are elastic and will vibrate at their modal frequencies when they are appro-\npriately excited. The appendages of spacecraft in particular can be very flimsy structures\ncompared with any Earthbound equivalents, and their fundamental frequency\u2014their low-\nest modal frequency\u2014can be very low indeed. The solar arrays of the Hubble telescope\nhave a mode with frequency 0.11 Hz for example. Theory indicates that there are an infin-\nity of modes with frequencies higher than the fundamental, each with its corresponding\nmodal shape.\n\nThe solar arrays shown in Figure 9.3 of Chapter 9, the form in which they appear\non many spacecraft, are cantilevered outwards from the central body and each will have\nbending and torsional modes. The frequencies of the bending modes of a single, rigidly\nattached uniform cantilever are given by\n\nf = (K 2?/8L2)\n?\n\n(EI /?A)Hz (3.60)\n\nwhere\nK ? 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, . . .for the different modes,\nL = array length (m)\nE = Young\u2019s modulus (N/m2)\nI = second moment of area (m4)\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX: THE INERTIA MATRIX 73\n\n? = density (kg/m3)\nA = cross-sectional area (m2)\n\nHowever, on a spacecraft it is unlikely that the attachment will be rigid, and the actual\nfundamental frequency may be only about 50% of the value given by this equation. A\nlarge number of the overtones\u2019 frequencies fall within the passband of the ACS.\n\nAny oscillation of the solar arrays will be transmitted to the main structure of the space-\ncraft by the bending moments and shear forces at their roots. In consequence, the payload\nwill tend to oscillate in sympathy with the flexure modes. This occurred on the Hubble\ntelescope, the oscillation being initiated by the thermal shock that took place when it\nmoved from being in eclipse to being in sunlight.\n\nThis simple example of an interaction is compounded by interactions between different\nflexure modes, affecting their modal frequencies. Forecasting the modal properties of the\nspacecraft as a whole is a complicated process for which specialist software packages are\nused (see also Chapter 8).\n\nIt should be noted that flexural oscillations do not directly involve external forces\nand moments on the spacecraft and so they do not directly affect the momenta, linear\nor angular.\n\n3.6 IN CONCLUSION\n\nThe material in this chapter has been aimed primarily at the dynamics of the main cate-\ngories of spacecraft. The benefits of adopting certain mass distributions and torque axes\nhave been shown, together with the consequence of doing otherwise.\n\nThere are likely to be increasingly many occasions in which the designer has to deal\nwith non-optimum mass distributions, as, for example, when reusable launch vehicles\npart with their payload and when large space structures are assembled or constructed in\norbit. The fundamental laws still apply but the control systems will have to adjust to the\nchanges in the mass distribution.\n\nThe methods contained in the chapter are not confined to the conventional configu-\nrations. Any configurations that may be treated as being made up of rigid bodies may\nbe dealt with in the manner shown. Their linear momenta, moments-of-momentum and\nangular momenta will obey the Newtonian equations (3.7) or (3.18), (3.12) and (3.28),\nrespectively. The components of their angular momentum HC may be found by using\nequations (3.31) or (3.35), having first obtained their inertia matrix using the Appendix.\nAll the Newtonian equations should be developed by using the Coriolis theorem as illus-\ntrated in equation (3.30), enabling the motion equations to be expressed in terms of the\ncomponents of their velocities, linear and angular, along any desired axes.\n\nAPPENDIX: THE INERTIA MATRIX\n\nA1 Introduction\n\nThe inertia matrix [IO ] referred to a point O is a property of the mass distribution about\nO .

For example, an aircraft whose xz -plane is a plane of symmetry\nwill have Ixy and Iyz equal to zero.\n\nIf two of the coordinate planes are planes of symmetry, then all three of the prod-\nucts of inertia will be zero. This applies to axially symmetric bodies such as many\nexpendable launchers.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX: THE INERTIA MATRIX 75\n\n\u2022 Principal axes are sets of orthogonal axes for which all three products of inertia are\nzero.

Swinerd2 and Peter W.\n\nFortescue2\n\n1 School of Engineering and Material Science, Queen Mary, University of London\n2 Aeronautics and Astronautics, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment,\nUniversity of Southampton\n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe theory of celestial mechanics underlies all the dynamical aspects of the orbital motion\nof spacecraft. The central feature is the mutual gravitational force of attraction that acts\nbetween any two bodies. This was first described by Newton, and together with his laws\nof motion (see Chapter 3), it provides us with the theoretical framework for celestial\nmechanics. The orbits that it forecasts will be relative to an Inertial Frame of Reference\n(IFR) that is fixed with respect to the stars; the consequential motion relative to the ground\nwill also be covered in Chapter 5.\n\nThe simplified case in which the gravitational force acts between two pointlike objects\ngives a good approximation to orbital motion for most spacecraft situations. It may easily\nbe shown that if a body has a uniform mass distribution within a spherical surface, then\noutside it the gravitational force from the body does indeed appear to emanate from a\npointlike source. This so-called two-body problem has a solution\u2014a Keplerian orbit.\n\nKepler, whose major works were published during the first 20 years of the seventeenth\ncentury, consolidated the observations of planetary motion into three simple laws, which\nare illustrated in Figure 4.1. These are\n\n1. the orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the Sun occupying one focus;\n2. the line joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time;\n3. a planet\u2019s orbital period is proportional to the mean distance between Sun and the\n\nplanet, raised to the power 3/2.\n\nNewton\u2019s theory of gravity, predicting the above results, was not developed until more\nthan 65 years later.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

As the altitude of a spacecraft\u2019s orbit decreases, the departure from\nspherical symmetry of the Earth\u2019s mass and shape becomes more important, together\nwith aerodynamic forces. At high altitudes such as in geostationary orbits (?36 000 km)\nthe gravitational pull of the other celestial bodies such as the Moon and Sun become\nsignificant, together with radiation pressure from the Sun.\n\nThe theory of celestial mechanics is required in order that the motion of a spacecraft\nmay be predicted. In most situations the accuracy required for the vehicle\u2019s position is\nrelatively modest\u2014typically a few kilometres. However, there are significant deviations\nfrom this, one important case being when the space vehicle must perform a manoeuvre\nto change its orbit (this topic is left to the next chapter). It should be noted that for some\nvehicles, particularly those that employ active remote sensing instrumentation, precise\norbit determination is required. An accuracy of the order of 1 m was required for Seasat,\nand values of 10 cm or less are a requirement for the European Envisat spacecraft. Such\nprecision in orbit determination is difficult because our knowledge of the Earth\u2019s gravity\nfield remains limited, and more importantly because of the uncertainties associated with\nsurface forces, in particular, aerodynamic drag. The former problem will be alleviated\nwhen dedicated spacecraft missions to determine the Earth\u2019s gravity field are flown. The\nsolution to the latter problem of quantifying drag is much more elusive, since difficulties\nare associated with adequately modelling the atmospheric density, atmospheric winds, the\nresponse of the atmosphere to solar activity and the magnitude of lift and drag coefficients\nrelevant to spacecraft. Consequently, the precise orbit can only be determined retrospec-\ntively. Fortunately, the accuracy level required for orbit prediction, derived for tracking\nand operational activities, is much less stringent.\n\n4.2 THE TWO-BODY PROBLEM\u2014PARTICLE DYNAMICS\n\nThe simplest problem in celestial mechanics concerns the predicted motion of two co-\nrotating point masses. It is assumed in this analysis that the sole force acting between\nthem is their mutual gravitational attraction. Newton demonstrated that the gravitational\nfield from any pointlike body is solely dependent upon its mass. The field\u2019s potential U\nat a distance R from a particle of mass M is simply\n\nU = ?GM\nR\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere G is the universal constant of gravitation, having a numerical value in SI units of\n6.670 \u00d7 10?11 N m2/kg2.\n\nIf two masses m1 and m2 are a distance r apart, as shown in Figure 4.2, then the equation\ngoverning their motion due to their mutual gravitational attraction is easily obtained by\ncombining Newton\u2019s Laws of gravity and motion. Newton\u2019s Law of gravity gives the\nforces F1 and F2 acting on the masses as\n\nF1 = Gm1m2\nr2\n\n( r\nr\n\n)\n, F2 = Gm1m2\n\nr2\n\n(?r\nr\n\n)\n(4.2)\n\n\n\n82 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nm1 \n\nm2\n\nIFR \n\nr1\n\nr2\n\nr \n\nFigure 4.2 The two-body problem geometry in an inertial frame of reference (IFR)\n\nThe motion of each mass with respect to the IFR is expressed by Newton\u2019s second law\nof motion,\n\nm1r?1 = F1, m2r?2 = F2 (4.3)\n\nBy noting that r = r2 ? r1, we may combine equations (4.2) and (4.3) to give\n\nr? + G(m1 + m2)\nr2\n\n( r\nr\n\n)\n= 0\n\nwhich is the equation of unperturbed motion due to gravity of mass m2 with respect to\nmass m1.\n\nThe restricted two-body problem assumes that the mass of one body far exceeds that of\nthe other, m1 ? m2 say. This applies to a spacecraft of mass m , say about 103 to 104 kg,\ncompared with a heavenly body of mass M ; Earth\u2019s mass, for example, is 6 \u00d7 1024 kg.\nIn this case the equation above reduces to:\n\nr? + (GM )\nr2\n\nr\nr\n\n= 0 (4.4)\n\nEquation (4.4) is also a good approximation for the planets and the Sun, since even the\nlargest one, Jupiter (?2 \u00d7 1027 kg), is dominated by the Sun (?2 \u00d7 1030 kg).\n\nThe parameter GM , here referred to as ?, is the gravitational parameter for the body\nabout which the motion is taking place.

The constants associated with a particular orbit may be thought of as being\nconstants of integration of equation (4.4) or they may be approached in physical terms\nvia conservation laws, as in Chapter 3.\n\nMoment-of-momentum conservation follows from the fact that the only force acting has\nno moment about the centre of the primary body.

Also, note that the mean motion n is defined by\n\nn = 2?/? =\n?(\n\n?/a3\n)\n\n(4.17)\n\nTherefore, if we suppose that the spacecraft passes through perifocus at time zero (i.e.\ntp = 0), then the time of flight t from perifocus to the current position is given by\n\nE ? e sin E = M (4.18)\n\nwhere the mean anomaly is defined by\n\nM = nt (4.19)\n\nEquation (4.18) is known as Kepler\u2019s equation. It provides a simple relationship between\ntime and position, which can be used in conjunction with equations (4.13) and (4.14) to\nprovide a complete specification of position with time. The problem of the determination\nof position given the time of flight from perifocus can be represented symbolically by the\nfollowing chain of operations,\n\nTime t \u2014equation (4.19) ? M \u2014equation (4.18) ? E \u2014equation (4.14) ?\nPosition ? .\n\nConversely, to determine the time to reach a given position the above chain is reversed,\nPosition ? \u2014equation (4.14) ? E \u2014equation (4.18) ? M \u2014equation (4.19) ?\n\nTime t .\n\nIt is important to note that the latter chain of operations can be performed analytically.\nHowever, the M ? E step of the former chain requires a computational solution of\nKepler\u2019s equation (4.18). This problem has attracted a great deal of attention since Kepler\nfirst wrote down his famous equation, and over a 100 ways of solving it have been\npresented in the literature. Newton\u2019s method of successive approximations is well suited\nto the task. Given the values of M and e, successive estimates of E can be obtained\niteratively using\n\nEi+1 = Ei ?\n(\n\nEi ? e sin Ei ? M\n1 ? e cos Ei\n\n)\n, E0 = M (4.20)\n\nExample: Estimate the time for a spacecraft to move through the 60? of true anomaly\ncentred around the apogee point, for an orbit with a = 24 000 km and e = 0.7.\n\n\n\n88 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nSolution: Let perigee be point P0, the point at true anomaly 150? be point P1 and the\npoint at true anomaly 210? be point P2. We need to find the time of flight from point\nP1 to point P2. Using the chain of operations above for ? ? t , we find the time from\nperigee to P1. At point P1 we have ?1 = 2.6180 rads, E1 = 2.0060 rads and M1 = 1.3713\nrads. This gives t(P0 ? P1) = 8075.61 s, which by symmetry is identical to t(P2 ? P0).\nHence the time to traverse the apogee region from P1 to P2 is\n\nt(P1 ?? P2) = ? ? t(P2 ?? P1) = 37 002.25 s ? (2 \u00d7 8075.61s)\n= 20851.03 s ? 5.8 h.\n\nA similar calculation shows that the spacecraft traverses a similar 60? interval of true\nanomaly centred on perigee in 807.57 s ? 0.22 h, which illustrates the significantly dif-\nferent velocity of the vehicle at perigee compared to apogee, for this highly eccentric orbit.\n\nThe velocity relationships for elliptic orbits may be obtained primarily from equation\n(4.7) and the vis-viva integral (equations 4.5 and 4.11), namely,\n\n1\n\n2\nV 2 ? ?\n\nr\n= ? = ? ?\n\n2a\n(4.21)\n\nThis equation is also the basis for velocity calculations for all conic section trajectories.\nFor a circular orbit (e = 0), the circular velocity is given by\n\nVcirc =\n?\n\n(?/r) (4.22)\n\nUsing this, one can note that for Earth-orbiting space vehicles having a 24-h period, the\norbit radius will be 4.2 \u00d7 104 km, so the velocity is 3.1 km/s.\n\nFor a spacecraft to orbit the Earth at its surface (equatorial radius 6378 km), the velocity\nneeded is 7.91 km/s. This is substantially larger than the Earth\u2019s equatorial velocity due\nto rotation of ?0.46 km/s. Thus this increment in velocity, 7.45 km/s, will be required\njust to orbit the Earth at zero altitude. This feature of orbit attainment will be developed\nfurther in Chapter 7, which deals with launch vehicles.\n\nFor elliptical and circular orbits (0 ? e < 1), the magnitude of the potential energy per\nunit mass is greater than the kinetic energy. The total energy ? per unit mass is negative,\na consequence of the potential energy zero datum being at infinity. This is a necessary\ncondition for a closed orbit, and may be used to determine planetary capture requirements\nfor interplanetary vehicles.\n\nParabolic trajectories (e = 1)\n\nFrom equation (4.8) it is apparent that as e tends to unity, the semi-major axis becomes\ninfinitely large; the parabolic trajectory is open to infinity (see Figure 4.7). The distance\nof its perifocus from the centre of the primary body is obtained from equation (4.7),\n\nrp = p/2 (4.23)\n\n\n\nTHE TWO-BODY PROBLEM\u2014PARTICLE DYNAMICS 4.2 89\n\nr\n\np\n\nrp rp\n\nq\n\nFocus\n\nPe\nrifo\n\ncu\ns\n\nDirectrix\n\np\n1+e cos qr = =\n\n2rp\n\nrp = perifocal length\n\n1+e cos q\n\nFigure 4.7 Parabola (e = 1)\n\nA position versus time relationship may be found by noting that h = r2?? which, together\nwith equation (4.7) yields\n\n?? =\n?\n\n(?/p3)(1 + e cos ?)2\n\nWhilst this equation is generally valid for all values of eccentricity, direct integration\nis only straightforward in the case e = 1, leading to Barker\u2019s equation\n\n2\n?\n\n(?/p3)(t ? tp) = 2M = tan ?\n2\n\n+ 1\n3\n\ntan3\n?\n\n2\n(4.24)\n\nwhere the time of perifocal passage tp is usually taken as zero.\nThe energy of a parabolic trajectory is zero, and as such it represents the boundary case\n\nbetween a captive, orbiting satellite and an escaping one. It is easy to see from equation\n(4.5) that the speed approaches zero at very large distances from the primary body. Con-\nsequently the parabola can be regarded as the minimum energy escape trajectory. Indeed,\nwith ? = 0 in equation (4.5), the minimum speed required for escape is shown to be\n\nVesc =\n?(\n\n2?\n\nr\n\n)\n(4.25)\n\nHyperbolic trajectories (e > 1)\n\nIt can be seen for equation (4.8) that the hyperbolic trajectory has a negative semi-\nmajor axis, a curious attribute that influences consideration of the hyperbolic motion and\ngeometry. The hyperbola is an open \u2018orbit\u2019 corresponding physically to planetary fly-by\ntrajectories or to escape trajectories when the spacecraft retains some residual speed at a\ngreat distance from the primary body.\n\n\n\n90 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nr\n\np\nb\n\n?a\n\n?a/e\n\nArea\nAsymptotes\n\nq?\n\nq\n\nFocus\n\nDirectrix\n\ncos q? = ?1/e\n\nF = 2(Area)\na2\n\nr (1  + e cos q) = p = a(1? e 2 )  = |b 2/a |\n\ne = ?2\n\nFigure 4.8 Hyperbola (e > 1)\n\nTo obtain a position versus time relationship a method analogous to that applied in the\nelliptic motion case may be used. A hyperbolic eccentric anomaly F is introduced, the\ngeometrical realization of which is given in terms of the shaded area shown in Figure 4.8.\nThe position on the hyperbola is given in terms of focal distance\n\nr = a(1 ? e cosh F ), (4.26)\n\nand true anomaly ? , which is related to F by\n\ntan\n?\n\n2\n= tanh\n\n(\nF\n\n2\n\n)?(\ne + 1\ne ? 1\n\n)\n(4.27)\n\nThe required relationship between position and time is then found to be analogous to\nKepler\u2019s equation,\n\nM = e sinh F ?

If the heliocentric distances of Jupiter\nand Pluto are 7.8 \u00d7 108 km and 59.0 \u00d7 108 km, respectively, produce a first estimate of\nthe transfer time from Jupiter to Pluto, neglecting the effects of the gravitational field of\neach planet.\n\nSolution: From equations (4.7) and (4.8), the true anomaly values on the hyperbola at\nJupiter and Pluto are ?J = 0.5291 rads and ?P = 1.7468 rads, respectively. From equation\n(4.27), the corresponding values of the hyperbolic eccentric anomaly are FJ = 0.3879 and\nFP = 2.4698. Using the hyperbolic analogy of Kepler\u2019s equation (4.28), the transit time\ncan be estimated from\n\nTtransit = tP ? tJ = (e sinh FP ? FP) ? (e sinh FJ ? FJ)?\n?/(?a)3\n\n= (15.1335) ?

This gives\n\ne = 1 + rpV\n2?\n\n?\n(4.32)\n\n\n\n92 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\n4.3 SPECIFYING THE ORBIT\n\nThe orbit equation (4.4) is equivalent to a sixth-order scalar differential equation that\nrequires six initial conditions in order to determine the six constants of integration. At orbit\ninjection these will be the three components of position and of velocity. A standard way of\nspecifying an orbit is to use orbital elements , which refer the orbit to a frame of reference\nthat is fixed relative to the stars. This is used both for astronomy and for satellites.\n\nThe frame of reference that is commonly used can be defined in terms of X -, Y -, and\nZ -axes (see Figure 4.9). The X - and Y -axes lie in Earth\u2019s equatorial plane and the Earth\nspins about the Z -axis.\n\nThe X -axis is in a direction from Earth to the Sun at the vernal equinox (?21 March).\nThe direction thus indicated is termed the first point of Aries . Some 2000 years ago this\ndirection did point towards the constellation of Aries, but at present it points to Aquarius,\nand is moving along the equator at about 0.8? per year.\n\nThe Z -axis is along the Earth\u2019s spin axis, in the northerly direction. It is at an angle\nof 23?27?8?? to the normal of the ecliptic plane, changing slowly with respect to the stars,\nwith a period of about 25 725 years. The overall precessional rate is ?0.12?? per year and\nmay be neglected for most spacecraft applications.\n\nThe Y -axis makes up a \u2018right-handed\u2019 orthogonal set with the X -, Z -axes.\nThe celestial sphere is the name given to a sphere with infinite radius centred on the\n\nEarth. The Z -axis meets it at a point known as the North celestial pole. The motion of\nthe Sun on the celestial sphere is indicated in Figure 4.9. It moves in the ecliptic plane,\ntilted about the X -axis through 23?27?8??, known as the obliquity of the ecliptic, ?.\n\nThe location of a point P on the celestial sphere, strictly a direction OP , can be\nexpressed in terms of the two angles ? and ?.

The angle ? between OX and the equatorial\nradius to the hour circle is called the right ascension of P . Its declination ? is the angle\nbetween OP and the equatorial plane (see Figure 4.9).\n\nThe six orbital elements of a spacecraft\u2019s orbit round the Earth are chosen to represent\ndifferent features. The orbital plane in Figure 4.10 intersects the equatorial plane in a\nline called the line of nodes; the ascending node is the point on the equator at which the\nspacecraft moves from the southern into the northern hemisphere. The right ascension of\nthis node together with the inclination angle i define the plane of the orbit. The orientation\nwithin the plane is defined by the angle ?, known as the argument of periapsis, which is\nthe angle measured in the direction of motion between the line of nodes and the vector e,\nwhich points to the periapsis. The shape of the orbit is defined by its eccentricity e, and\nits size by its semi-major axis a . The sixth element defines the position of the spacecraft\nin its orbit. The time (or epoch) of last passage through the periapsis may be used, or the\nmean anomaly M (equation 4.19).\n\n4.4 ORBIT PERTURBATIONS\n\nAt the distances of orbiting spacecraft from the Earth its asphericity and non-uniform mass\ndistribution result in its gravitational potential departing from the simple 1/r function,\nwhich was assumed in Section 4.2. Equation (4.1) is not valid in this situation and the\nequation of motion (4.4) must be modified to take account of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field.\n\nThere are additional forces that act on space vehicles, which were not included in the\nKeplerian formulation. Some are from additional masses that provide secondary gravi-\ntational fields; for Earth orbit, the Moon and the Sun provide such forces. Also, at low\naltitudes (typically at less than 1000 km altitude) the Earth\u2019s atmosphere imposes a drag\nforce. Table 4.2 lists the major perturbing forces, and their relative importance, for space\nvehicle orbital analysis.\n\n\n\n94 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nTable 4.2 Magnitude of disturbing accelerations\nacting on a space vehicle whose area-to-mass ratio is\nA/M.

A general closed solution is\nnot possible, but there are a variety of solution methods that are appropriate for spacecraft\ndynamics. The \u2018variation of orbital elements\u2019 method is described here. Other methods\nsuch as those first proposed by Cowell and Crommelin [2] and Encke [3] are summarized\nby Cornelisse et al. [4].\n\nThe method of the variation of orbital elements may be considered in the following\nway. The elements referred to in the preceding section are constants for a Keplerian orbit,\nas derived in Section 4.2. When perturbative forces exist, they are no longer constant but\nfor small forces they will change slowly.\n\nA simple, physical model will serve to demonstrate this. Consider a spacecraft in\ncircular orbit about a spherically symmetrical planet possessing an atmosphere of density\n? kg/m3. If it is assumed that the perturbative drag force is small, then it is to be expected\nthat the orbit will remain near circular. Now the velocity in a circular Keplerian orbit is\ngiven by\n\n?\n(?/r). If the spacecraft\u2019s projected area in the direction of flight is S , then\n\nthe work performed by the atmosphere as the vehicle moves round the orbit is given by\n? ??r?SCD?/r , where CD is an appropriate drag coefficient for the vehicle. Since this\nreduces the energy of the system, it is apparent that the energy constant ? in equation\n(4.21) will decrease and the orbital element a must do so too.\n\nThe variation of orbital elements method assumes that the actual orbit of a body, at\nany given instant, may be considered to have instantaneous values of Keplerian orbital\nelements. These are defined so that if the perturbing forces are removed at that instant, thus\nleaving only a central gravitational field whose potential is proportional to 1/r , then the\norbit will follow the Keplerian orbit that has the instantaneous orbital elements. These are\ncalled the osculating elements . It must be emphasized that the method is only appropriate\nfor perturbing forces having a magnitude significantly smaller than ?/r2.\n\n\n\nORBIT PERTURBATIONS 4.4 95\n\nThe normal method for so describing an orbit is with recourse to Lagrange\u2019s planetary\nequations (see e.g. Reference [5]). One Gaussian form of these is the following [6]:\n\nda\n\nd?\n= 2pr\n\n2\n\n?(1 ? e2)2\n{\n\ne sin ?S + p\nr\n\nT\n}\n\nde\n\nd?\n= r\n\n2\n\n?\n\n{\nsin ?S +\n\n(\n1 + r\n\np\n\n)\ncos ?T + e r\n\np\nT\n\n}\n\ndi\n\nd?\n= r\n\n3\n\n?p\ncos(? + ?)W\n\nd\n\n\nd?\n= r\n\n3 sin(? + ?)\n?p sin i\n\nW\n\nd?\n\nd?\n= r\n\n2\n\n?e\n\n{\n? cos ?S +\n\n(\n1 + r\n\np\n\n)\nsin ?T\n\n}\n? cos i d\n\n\nd?\ndt\n\nd?\n= r\n\n2?\n(?p)\n\n{\n1 + r\n\n2\n\n?e\n[cos ?S ?\n\n(\n1 + r\n\np\n\n)\nsin ?T ]\n\n}\n\n?????????????????????\n????????????????????\n\n(4.34)\n\nwhere S, T, W form a triad of perturbing accelerations in a spacecraft-centred coordinate\nreference frame, S acting radially, T transverse to S in the orbital plane and directed\npositively in the sense of the spacecraft motion, and W normal to the orbit plane giving\na right-handed system of accelerations.\n\nIt should be noted that the particular form of Lagrange\u2019s equations adopted depends on\nthe type of orbit under investigation. For example, the set defined in equations (4.34) fails\nfor circular (e = 0) and equatorial (i = 0) orbits. These may be dealt with by introducing\nparameter transformations of the type given, for example, by Roy [7].\n\nSolutions of equations (4.34) must in general be performed using numerical techniques.\nThis requires the formulation of functions for U and b, and these are given below for\ncertain cases of particular interest.\n\n4.4.1 Gravitational potential of the Earth\n\nThe most convenient method for describing Earth\u2019s gravitational field outside its surface\nis to use a spherical harmonic expansion [8], given by\n\nU (r , ?, ?) = ?\nr\n\n{\n?1 +\n\n??\nn=2\n\n[(\nRE\nr\n\n)n\nJnPn0(cos ?)\n\n+\nn?\n\nm=1\n\n(\nRE\nr\n\n)n\n(Cnm cos m? + Snm sin m?)Pnm(cos ?)\n\n]}\n(4.35)\n\nwhere U (r , ?, ?) is the gravitational potential at a distance r from the centre of the Earth\nand ?, ? are the latitude and longitude. Pnm are Legendre polynomials. Jn , Cnm and Snm\nare numerical values dependent on the mass distribution of the body, in this case the\nEarth. Terms of the form Jn are called zonal harmonic coefficients; they reflect the mass\ndistribution of the Earth independently of longitude. Cnm and Snm are the Earth\u2019s tesseral\nharmonic coefficients for n \n= m and the sectoral harmonic coefficients for n = m .\n\n\n\n96 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nThese coefficients have mainly been determined from the motion of Earth-orbiting\nspacecraft. Whilst the lower-order terms were determined during the early 1960s, deter-\nmination of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field continues to be an area of active research.\nConsequently there is a plethora of \u2018standard\u2019 global gravity field models, for example,\nthe Joint Gravity Model (JGM) series [9], of which the JGM-3 model is an example. This\ngives the harmonic coefficient values to degree and order 70.\n\nOne of the major problems in determination of the higher-order terms is due to their\nrapid decrease in magnitude with altitude; from equation (4.35) terms decrease with\n(RE /r)n . However, at low altitudes there are also difficulties, since the gravity effects\nare difficult to separate from other perturbations, in particular, those due to variable air\ndrag. This situation is greatly improved by the launch of dedicated spacecraft missions to\ndetermine the higher-order harmonic coefficients in the Earth\u2019s gravity field. Promising\nproposals, such as the US GRAVSAT and the European ARISTOTELES missions, were\nstalled in the 1990s because of fiscal problems. However, dedicated in-orbit gravity field\ndetermination got underway with the launch of the CHAMP spacecraft in July 2000, and\nthe twin GRACE satellites in March 2002. Further significant advancement in gravity field\nmodelling is in prospect with the launch of the ESA GOCE spacecraft in March 2009. This\nhas been launched into a very low 250 km altitude circular orbit to enhance the sensitivity\nof the measurement of the Earth\u2019s field. Premature re-entry of the spacecraft is avoided\nby the use of ion propulsion to compensate for the atmospheric drag perturbations.\n\nTable 4.3 gives the magnitude of some of the lower-order coefficients taken from a\ncurrent geoid model [9]. From this it is apparent that the term J2 is some three orders of\nmagnitude larger than the others, and to a first approximation it dominates the gravitational\nperturbative influences of the Earth. This term represents the polar flattening of the Earth\n(or equatorial bulge), and its magnitude can be summarized by noting that the Earth\u2019s\npoles are approximately 21 km closer to the Earth\u2019s centre than the equator. This \u2018excess\u2019\ngravitational mass in the equatorial regions influences the motion of an orbiting spacecraft\nprincipally in two ways\u2014 the regression of the line of nodes and the precession of the line\nof apsides . Before discussing these, it is worth commenting briefly on the effects of the\nsmaller tesseral harmonic coefficients.\n\nAs can be seen from equation (4.35), the Cnm and Snm coefficients are associated\nwith the longitudinal variation in the geopotential surface. These variations are generally\nsmaller than those due to the dominant zonal harmonic terms, producing variations of the\norder of a few tens of metres in the height of the geopotential surface as measured above\na reference spheroid. These small longitudinal variations tend to be \u2018averaged-out\u2019 by the\neffect of the Earth\u2019s rotation beneath the orbital plane of a low Earth-orbiting satellite.\nThe resulting perturbing effect on the satellite\u2019s motion is small and periodic, generally\nproducing a negligible net effect on each orbit. Their short-periodic effect must, however,\n\nTable 4.3 Magnitude of low-order J, C and S values for\nEarth\n\nJ2 1082.6 \u00d7 10?6 C21 0 S21 0\nJ3 ?2.53 \u00d7 10?6 C22 1.57 \u00d7 10?6 S22 ?0.90 \u00d7 10?6\nJ4 ?1.62 \u00d7 10?6 C31 2.19 \u00d7 10?6 S31 0.27 \u00d7 10?6\nJ5 ?0.23 \u00d7 10?6 C32 0.31 \u00d7 10?6 S32 ?0.21 \u00d7 10?6\nJ6 0.54 \u00d7 10?6 C33 0.10 \u00d7 10?6 S33 0.20 \u00d7 10?6\n\n\n\nORBIT PERTURBATIONS 4.4 97\n\nbe taken into account for spacecraft missions requiring very precise orbit determination\n(e.g. geodetic missions).\n\nTesseral harmonics can, however, produce moderate changes in the satellite\u2019s orbit if\nthe orbit is in a resonant state with respect to the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. This occurs\nwhen the orbit period is such that the ground track of the satellite repeats precisely after\na number of orbits and days. The orbit perturbations in this case are small but secular,\ncausing a build-up of orbit changes while the satellite remains in the resonant state.\nIt should be emphasized, though, that the resonant state is the exception rather than\nthe rule, and generally the effect of the tesseral harmonic component is small for low\nEarth-orbiting satellites. A spacecraft in a Geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) encounters\na form of resonance with respect to the lowest-order sectoral harmonic coefficients\n(n = m = 2), and this is often referred to as triaxiality . This is also discussed below.\n\nRegression of the line of nodes\n\nThe equatorial bulge produces a torque that rotates the angular momentum vector. For\nprograde orbits (i < 90?), the orbit rotates in a westerly direction, leading to a regression\nof the line of nodes as shown pictorially in Figure 4.11. Neglecting all harmonic coeffi-\ncients other than J2, the rate of nodal regression may be written [7] to the first order in\nJ2 as\n\n?\n = \n0 ? 3\n2\n\nJ2R2E\np2\n\n?nt cos i + O[J 22 ] (4.36)\n\nwhere ?n is the mean angular velocity,\n?\n\n(?/a3).

Since the gravitational field of the Earth is\nconservative, however, this leads to an overall rotation of the orbit, within the orbit plane,\nas demonstrated in Figure 4.12. This motion implies rotation of the semi-major axis and\nis termed precession of the line of apsides. The secular effect is given by\n\n?? = ?0 + 3\n2\n\nJ2R2E\np2\n\n?n\n(\n\n2 ? 5\n2\n\nsin2 i\n\n)\nt + O[J 22 ] (4.38)\n\nor per orbit\n\n\n? = 3?

In the 1960s, the Soviet Union\ndevised a highly eccentric orbit with this inclination, called a Molniya orbit. The resulting\n\u2018frozen apogee\u2019 condition was used to good effect for high-latitude communications, as\ndiscussed in Chapter 5.\n\nDifferential evolutionary rates\n\nEach of the rates of orbital evolution noted in equations (4.36) to (4.39) indicate the abso-\nlute changes in the orbital elements relative to an inertial frame. As such, it is clear from\nthe numerical values given in Table 4.3 why it is that the J2 term dominates the evolution\nof an orbit (see also Figure 4.15). There are, however, several important situations when it\nis the differential rate of evolution of two or more orbits that should be considered. Cases\nto note are, for example, a satellite constellation requiring orbiting vehicles to maintain\na fixed relative position, or where satellites are required to co-orbit in formation. A third\nexample is the differential evolution of a space debris cloud [10].\n\n\n\nORBIT PERTURBATIONS 4.4 99\n\nExpressions for the evolution of an orbit due to higher harmonic terms can be found\nin Reference [11]. These may be partially differentiated to find the relative evolutionary\nrate of two orbits as a function of changes in each of the orbit elements, the semi-major\naxis, eccentricity and so on. If the semi-major axis is varied, then the differential rates of\nevolution in right ascension of the ascending node and the argument of perifocus may be\nwritten in the form\n\n?\nn\n\n?a\n= \nn and ??n\n\n?a\n= \n?n\n\nwhere for the second, third and fourth harmonic terms we have\n\n?\n2\n\n?t\n= ?5.25a?9/2(1 ? e2)?2?1/2J2R2E cos i\n\n?\n3\n\n?t\n= ?1.6875a?11/2e(1 ? e2)?3?1/2J3R3E cot i(15 sin2 i ? 4) sin ?\n\n?\n4\n\n?t\n= 1.1786a?13/2(1 ? e2)?4?1/2J4R4E\n\n\u00d7 cos i [(1 + 1.5e2)(7 cos2 i ? 3) ?

The term J22 equal to (C 222 + S 222)1/2 has the greatest influence\ndue to the (RE/r)n weighting of coefficients. This term represents the slight ellipticity of\nthe Earth\u2019s equatorial cross-section, having its major axis aligned approximately along\n15 ?W\u2013165 ?E.\n\nThe term \u2018triaxiality\u2019 is derived from the geometrical form of the Earth resulting from\nthe combination of the oblateness and J22 characteristics. To lowest order, the Earth may\nbe modelled as an oblate spheroid with an elliptical equatorial cross-section. This form is\n\n\n\n100 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nLo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n d\nrif\n\nt (\nde\n\ngr\nee\n\ns)\n\n40\u00b0\n30\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n? ? ?0 = 5\u00b0\n\nTime (days)\n\n10 50 80\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nDrift rate\ninitially zero\n\nFigure 4.13 Longitudinal drift acquired over a period in geostationary orbit, as a\nfunction of the difference (? ? ?0) in initial operating longitude and minor axis (stable)\nlongitude\n\ngenerated by three mutually orthogonal axes (tri-axes) centred on the Earth\u2019s centre, each\ncorresponding to a different Earth radius. A satellite will be stable if it is at a minimum\nof the Earth\u2019s potential field, that is, on the minor axis of the equator. Departure from\nthese two longitude positions provides an increasing perturbation. Agrawal [12] gives the\nfollowing expression for the longitudinal acceleration:\n\n?? = k 2 sin 2(? ? ?0) (4.40)\n\nwhere k 2 = ?18J22?2e (R2E/a2s ) ? ?1.7 \u00d7 10?3 deg/day2 and ?0 = 75? E or 255? E (sta-\nble longitudes). Here ?e is the sidereal rotation rate of the Earth and as is the semi-major\naxis of the synchronous orbit.\n\nLongitude drift over time is shown in Figure 4.13.\nTriaxiality can be seen to provide an East/West station-keeping problem for a geosta-\n\ntionary satellite. This is referred to in Chapter 5.\n\n4.4.2 Atmospheric drag\n\nFor low Earth-orbiting spacecraft, the perturbation due to the atmosphere cannot be\nneglected. Atmospheric effects lead to a force that may be expressed as two orthogo-\nnal components\u2014drag along the direction of travel and lift at right angles to it. The\nsimplest form in which to write the drag force is\n\nFD = 1\n2\n?SCD V\n\n2\nr\n\n(?Vr\n|Vr |\n\n)\n(4.41)\n\nwhere Vr is the velocity vector of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere, ? is the\natmospheric density, S a reference area for the vehicle and CD the vehicle\u2019s coefficient\nof drag referred to the reference area.\n\n\n\nORBIT PERTURBATIONS 4.4 101\n\nThe lifting force is obtained by replacing CD with the coefficient of lift CL, in equation\n(4.41), and by noting that the lift force acts perpendicular to the velocity vector Vr . For\nmost spacecraft the effects of lift are negligible compared with drag, but when precise orbit\ndetermination is required (? few metres accuracy) its influence must be included [13].\n\nThe drag coefficient for space vehicles is somewhat complex due to the type of flow\nregime within which the motion takes place. Because of the large mean free path, the flow\ncannot be treated in a continuum manner. Indeed, the most suitable description is that\nof free molecular flow wherein the molecular description is such that molecules reflected\nfrom the spacecraft surfaces do not interact further with the flow field; no shock wave\nis therefore formed about a body moving through the atmosphere at orbit altitudes. The\ndrag force experienced is dependent on the gas\u2014surface interaction, for which there\nis only sparse experimental data at typical incident velocities. Stalder and Zurick [14],\nSchaff and Chambre [15] and Schamberg [16] provide the basic theory for rarefied flow,\nand Cook [17] provides height-related CD data adopting the Schamberg model. Typically\nvalues of CD ? 2.5 are predicted by these theories, when the reference area is taken as\nthe spacecraft\u2019s cross-sectional area projected normal to the velocity vector.\n\nWith reference to equation (4.41), drag is most significant at perigee where both the\nvelocity and density are greatest. King-Hele [5] provides detailed analysis of the secular\nchanges caused by drag. To first order, these approximate to an impulsive, negative\nvelocity increment occurring at perigee. This will lead to a reduction in the semi-major\naxis of an elliptical orbit. For a circular orbit, drag will occur continuously around the\norbit. Assuming that the change in the radius of such an orbit is small, the \n? in orbit\nperiod for a circular orbit of radius r will be given by\n\n\n?\n\n?\n? ?3??r(SCD/M ) (4.42)\n\nwhere ? is the density at r (measured from the centre of the Earth) and M /SCD is called\nthe vehicle ballistic parameter; M is the vehicle mass, and S the projected area.\n\nThe dominant influences of drag are thus to cause orbit contraction and circularization,\nwith eventual re-entry. Since the Earth\u2019s atmosphere rotates approximately synchronously\nwith the Earth, in general the drag force has a component perpendicular to the orbit plane.\nThis results in a change in inclination of the orbit. King-Hele [5] gives expressions for\nthe radial, transverse and normal acceleration components for a vehicle moving through\nan atmosphere rotating at an angular rate ? rad/s.

The proximity and mass of the Moon provides the most significant\ninfluence. The Sun is a great deal further away but its larger mass generates an influence\nthat is of a similar order of magnitude. These perturbations are collectively termed luni-\nsolar perturbations . Since in general these bodies will not lie in the same plane as the\nvehicle orbit, their most significant influence will be to change the inclination of the orbit\nwith respect to the equator. The formulation of this three-body interaction does not admit\na general closed-form solution, and numerical techniques must be employed.\n\nThe disturbing acceleration ad of a satellite due to a disturbing body having a mass Md\nand gravitational parameter ?d is given by\n\nad = ?d\n?\n\n(R\u00b7R) (4.44)\n\nwhere\n\nR = rsd\nr3sd\n\n? rd\nr3d\n\nand rsd and rd are defined in Figure 4.14.\nIt can then be shown [4] that the maximum value of the ratio of the disturbing accel-\n\neration ad to the central acceleration ac is given by\n\nad\nac\n\n= Md\nMc\n\n(\nrs\nrd\n\n)3 ?\n(1 + 3 cos2 ?)

For\na spacecraft in near-Earth orbit, where F? = 1400 W/m2, the resulting mean SRP is\napproximately PE = 4.7 \u00d7 10?6N/m2. The effect of this pressure as a force acting on the\nvehicle is dependent upon the reflective characteristics of the spacecraft surfaces.\n\nAn Earth-orbiting spacecraft is also immersed in other electromagnetic radiation fields,\nsuch as those due to Earth albedo and infra-red emission, which similarly produce a\nperturbing force on the vehicle. However, these are generally subordinate in magnitude\nto the dominate solar radiation effect.\n\nThe perturbing effect of SRP on a spacecraft\u2019s trajectory is directly dependent upon the\nvehicle\u2019s area-to-mass ratio A/m , and inversely proportional to the square of its distance\nfrom the Sun. Hence, the magnitude of the SRP force per unit spacecraft mass (the\ndisturbing acceleration) along the Sun\u2014spacecraft line may be expressed as\n\nfSRP = s A\nm\n\nPE\n\n(\na?\nr?\n\n)2\n(4.47)\n\nwhere r? and a? are the spacecraft\u2019s distance and the Earth\u2019s mean distance from the Sun,\nrespectively; s is a constant whose value, between 0 and 2, depends upon the reflective\nproperties of the spacecraft\u2019s surface.\n\nTo estimate how the orbit elements are perturbed by SRP, Lagrange\u2019s planetary\nequations (4.34) may be used, with the triad of disturbing accelerations given by [19]:\n\nS = fSRPS0(?), T = fSRPT0(?), W = fSRP W0 (4.48)\n\nwhere S0(?), T0(?) and W0 are direction cosines,{\nS0(?)\nT0(?)\n\n}\n= ? cos2 i\n\n2\ncos2\n\n?\n\n2\n\n{\ncos\nsin\n\n}\n(?? ? u ? \n)\n\n? sin2 i\n2\n\nsin2\n?\n\n2\n\n{\ncos\nsin\n\n}\n(?? ? u + \n)\n\n? 1\n2\n\nsin i sin ?\n\n[{\ncos\nsin\n\n}\n(?? ? u) ?\n\n{\ncos\nsin\n\n}\n(??? ? u)\n\n]\n\n? sin2 i\n2\n\ncos2\n?\n\n2\n\n{\ncos\nsin\n\n}\n(??? ? u + \n)\n\n? cos2 i\n2\n\nsin2\n?\n\n2\n\n{\ncos\nsin\n\n}\n(??? ? u ? \n), (4.49)\n\nW0 = sin i cos2 ?\n2\n\nsin(?? ? \n) ? sin i sin2 ?\n2\n\nsin(?? + \n)\n? cos i sin ? sin ??. (4.50)\n\n\n\nORBIT PERTURBATIONS 4.4 105\n\nHere u = ? + ?, ? is the obliquity of the ecliptic, and ?? is the ecliptic longitude of\nthe Sun.\n\nA method of integrating these equations was developed by Harwood and Swinerd [20],\nwho applied the theory to the satellites Explorer 19 and Lageos [21].\n\nCommunication spacecraft in GEO, many of which have large solar array surfaces,\nexperience SRP perturbations to their orbits. Generally, this leads to an increase in\nthe eccentricity of the orbit, which has implications for station-keeping activities (see\nChapter 5). For Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft, below around 600 km in altitude, the\neffects of air drag, however, dominate those of radiation pressure.\n\n4.4.5 Concluding remarks\n\nFigure 4.15 illustrates the relative magnitude of the main sources of perturbation act-\ning upon an Earth-orbiting spacecraft. For each effect, the logarithm of the disturbing\nacceleration, normalized to 1 g , is shown as a function of altitude.\n\nFrom the diagram it is apparent that the primary inverse square law gravity field of\nthe Earth is very much the dominant influence. The only effect to compete with this is\naerodynamic drag, the drag curve reaching the 1 g level at low altitude around 80 km. In\nthis case the spacecraft encounters an atmospheric re-entry situation, when the magnitude\nof inertial accelerations due to aerodynamic effects can equal and exceed the gravitational\nacceleration (see Chapter 5).\n\nAfter primary gravity, the zonal harmonic potential terms begin to play a role. The J2,\nor Earth oblateness, effects are around three orders of magnitude smaller than primary\ngravity, but nevertheless lead to significant perturbations in the orbit perigee and nodal\npositions as we have seen in Section 4.4.1. These effects must be modelled accurately\n\nPrimary gravity\n\nJ2\n\nJ3\n\nJ4\nJ5\n\nLunar gravity\nSolar gravity\n\nSRP\n\nDrag\n\nSpacecraft altitude (km)\n\nlo\ng 1\n\n0 \n(n\n\nor\nm\n\nal\niz\n\ned\n a\n\ncc\nel\n\ner\nat\n\nio\nn)\n\n0\n\n?2\n\n?4\n\n?6\n\n?8\n\n?10\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n\nFigure 4.15 Comparisons of the disturbing accelerations for the main sources of\nperturbation\n\n\n\n106 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nwhen planning LEO operations, for example, rendezvous strategies. The higher-order\nzonal harmonics are of lesser importance, but still lead to significant long-period per-\nturbations in the orbit elements. These higher-order terms decrease rapidly in magnitude\nwith altitude, and are comparable to the third-body forces of lunar and solar gravity.\n\nThe surface forces, drag and SRP, are dependent upon the spacecraft area-to-mass ratio,\nand a representative value of A/m = 0.005 m2/kg was used for the purpose of compiling\nFigure 4.15. Furthermore, the drag curve is dependent upon the level of solar activity.\nHere a moderate level was chosen, although it is worth noting that at, say, 500 km altitude\nthe drag acceleration can be an order of magnitude higher at solar maximum than at\nsolar minimum.\n\nThe SRP curve is effectively independent of altitude, since it is a function of distance\nfrom the Sun, rather than from the Earth. The heliocentric distance of an Earth-orbiting\nspacecraft obviously does vary, but the effect on the disturbing acceleration is essentially\nsecond order. It is interesting to note the altitude at which the SRP and drag curves\nintersect. Figure 4.15 suggests that above 600 to 700 km altitude SRP dominates. To try\nto estimate more precisely the altitude at which this transition occurs is difficult since it\nis dependent upon the level of solar activity.\n\n4.5 RESTRICTED THREE-BODY PROBLEM\n\nThe three-body problem refers to the problem of predicting the motion of three bodies,\neach influenced by the gravitational fields of the others. There is no general solution to the\nequations governing this. Of particular relevance to spacecraft is the circular restricted\nform of this problem, in which two of the bodies have masses that far outweigh the mass\nof the third, and are in circular orbits about each other.\n\nAn important example of this is when a spacecraft moves within the region of space that\nis dominated by both Earth and Moon; their masses are, respectively, about 6 \u00d7 1024 and\n7 \u00d7 1022 kg. Another example is a rendezvous with a comet that has a mass distribution\nlike a dumbbell. In both of these cases, the two dominant masses move in approximately\ncircular orbits about their joint centre-of-mass\u2014their barycentre\u2014both lying on the same\ndiameter, which rotates at a constant angular rate ?.\n\nUsing a frame of reference (f.o.r.) that is centred on the barycentre and such that the\ntwo dominant masses are at fixed positions in it, then this f.o.r. is not an inertial one; it\nis rotating at a fixed rate ?. A small mass m , at position r relative to the barycentre, and\nat r1 and r2 relative to M1 and M2 as shown in Figure 4.16, will experience gravitational\nforces F1, F2, and possibly a disturbance or thrusting force Fd , where\n\nF1 = ?mGM1\nr31\n\nr1 and F2 = ?mGM2\nr32\n\nr2\n\nThe equation governing the motion of the mass m within this f.o.r. is:\n\nr? + 2(? \u00d7 r?) + (?\u00b7r)? ? ?2r = ?G\n(\n\nM1\nr31\n\nr1 + M2\nr32\n\nr2\n\n)\n+ 1\n\nm\nFd (4.51)\n\n\n\nRESTRICTED THREE-BODY PROBLEM 4.5 107\n\nBarycentre\n\nL3 L1 L2\n\nL5\n\nL4\n\nRotating frame of reference\nAngular rate ? \n\nM1\n\nM2\n\nr1 r2\n\nr\n\nm\n\nFigure 4.16 The restricted three-body situation, showing the Libration points L1 to L5\n\nIt should be noted that r? is not the absolute velocity v; it has components that are the\nrates of change of the components of r, along axes that are fixed in the (rotating) f.o.r. It\nis thus the velocity as it would be seen by an observer at the barycentre in Figure 4.16 and\nwho is rotating with the same angular velocity as the f.o.r. described above. r?, defined in\nsimilar fashion in terms of the rate of change of the components of r?, is the acceleration\nof the mass m as seen by the same observer.\n\nWhen the disturbance or thrust force Fd is zero, equation (4.51) may be integrated\nonce, to give the Jacobi Integral , the equivalent of the vis-viva equation (4.5) for this\nthree-body situation:\n\n1\n\n2\nr?2 ? 1\n\n2\n(r \u00d7 ?)2 ? G\n\n(\nM1\nr1\n\n+ M2\nr2\n\n)\n= J (4.52)\n\nJ is a constant of integration having the dimensions of energy per unit mass, whose\nvalue depends on the initial conditions.\n\nEquation (4.52) may be used in ways such as the following:\n\n\u2022 A trajectory in the three-body region cannot be obtained analytically. J remains\nconstant along a trajectory, however, and so equation (4.52) may be used as a \u2018check\u2019\nwhen a numerical integration of equation (4.51) is used to predict a trajectory.\n\n\u2022 Escape criterion: The requirement for a body to escape from the two dominant bodies\nis for J to be at least zero. The reasoning is similar to that used in Section 4.2,\n\u2018Parabolic trajectories\u2019.\n\nFor each value of J less than zero, a surface surrounding the two dominant bodies\nmay be determined when r? = 0. This represents a boundary beyond which a spacecraft\nwith this amount of J cannot go. The intersection of this zero-velocity surface with\nthe x ? y plane of the rotating frame of reference is shown in Figure 4.17(a) to (f) for\n\n\n\n108 CELESTIAL MECHANICS\n\nEart   \n\n \n\n \n\nMoon \n\n J =  ?1.84345  (km/s)\u00b2/kg \n\n(a)\n\nEarth \n\nMoon \ninside \n\ncontour. \n\nJ =  ?1.67077  (km/s)\u00b2/kg \nL2 value. \n\n(d)\n\nEarth\n\nL2 L3 \n\nL1 \n\nL1 \n\nL1 L2 L2 \n\nL5 \n\nL4 \n\nL3 \n\nJ =  ?1.5865  (km/s)\u00b2/kg,\nL3 value. \n\n(e)\n\nMoon Earth\n\nEarth Earth\n\nEarth\n\nJ =  ?1.5775  (km/s)\u00b2/kg \n\n(f)\n\nJ =  ?1.6793  (km/s)\u00b2/kg,\nL1 value. \n\n(b)\n\nJ =  ?1.675  (km/s)\u00b2/kg \n\n(c)\n\nFigure 4.17 The intersection of the zero-velocity surface with the Earth\u2013Moon x ? y\nplane as the energy level J changes\n\ndifferent values of J . The example shown is the Earth\u2013Moon system. Forbidden regions\nare shaded. In (a) a spacecraft with a low energy level (J < ?1.84345 (km/s)2/kg) will\nbe restricted to within the region around the Earth that is shown as approximately circular\nin this plane. If it is setting out from the Moon, it is restricted to a smaller circular region\nthere. On the other hand, if an object is outside the outer circle then it cannot reach the\nvicinity of either the Earth or the Moon.\n\nIncreasing energy progressively reduces the size of the restrictions, as shown in (a)\nto (f), with transfer between Earth and Moon becoming possible from (b) onwards\n(J > ?1.6793 (km/s)2/kg), and journeys beyond the Moon to outer space from (d) onwards\n(J > ?1.67077 (km/s)2/kg). \u2018Gateways\u2019 open at the points L1, L2 and L3 when the appro-\npriate energy levels are reached, and all restricted areas shrink to zero when the energy\nlevel J = ?1.5738 (km/s)2/kg of L4 and L5 is exceeded. These special points are the\nLagrangian Points . It is worth noting that in the Earth\u2013Moon system the energy levels\ndiffer very little between these points, with only 0.5% difference between L1 and L2,\nfor example.\n\n\u2022 Lagrangian, or Libration Points: These are five points fixed within the rotating frame\nof reference at which a stationary body will be in equilibrium. Denoted by L1 to\n\n\n\nREFERENCES 109\n\nL5, they all lie in the plane defined by the orbits of the primary bodies around each\nother (see Figures 4.16 and 4.17). Three of these, L1, L2 and L3, lie on the line\njoining the primary bodies, and correspond to unstable equilibrium positions. The\nL1 point, between the Earth and the Sun in this case, is a good position for solar\nobservatories, and the ESA SOHO spacecraft has been \u2018orbiting\u2019 this point since\nits launch in 1995. The outer Lagrange point L2 is becoming a popular operational\nlocation for astronomical observatories, such as the ESA Herschel infra-red telescope\nlaunched in 2009, and the James Webb Space Telescope which is due for launch in\n2014. Because of the unstable nature of the equilibrium about these points, station-\nkeeping activity is required to stabilize the \u2018orbits\u2019 of such spacecraft. Conversely,\nit can be shown that the off-axis points L4 and L5 are stable with respect to small\ndisplacements. An impressive example of this stability is the presence of a number\nof large asteroids, called the Trojans, oscillating about the L4 and L5 points with\nrespect to the Jupiter\u2013Sun system.\n\n\u2022 Effect of Fd: The inclusion of the extra force Fd into the Jacobi equation (4.52) leads\nto the right-hand side becoming\n\nJ + 1\nm\n\n?\nFd \u00b7 r? dt (4.53)\n\nFrom this it may be seen that the best direction for a thrust force aimed at changing the\nvalue of J is along the trajectory in this (non-inertial) frame of reference.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Brown, C.

Swinerd2\n\n1School of Engineering and Material Science, Queen Mary, University of London\n2Aeronautics and Astronautics, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment,\nUniversity of Southampton\n\n5.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nWhereas celestial mechanics deals with a spacecraft\u2019s dynamics and orbit relative to the\nstars, one aspect of mission analysis is to relate both orbit and attitude to the ground,\nthe Sun and so on. This ensures that operational aspects such as spacecraft\u2013ground com-\nmunications, power raising and spacecraft tracking can be achieved, which is of course\ncrucial to mission success. However, beyond these operational issues, the mission design\nprocess is also a systems level activity, performed early in the feasibility study stage,\nwhich has a significant influence upon the spacecraft design. Generally, a careful analysis\nof the mission objectives, and consequently the payload operation and orbital aspects, is\nrequired. This, in turn places design requirements upon the spacecraft subsystem elements\nsupporting the payload. The mission design then becomes an iterative process, wherein\nthe impacts on the spacecraft system design may compromise an optimal solution for the\nmission design, and vice versa . These system aspects of mission analysis are touched\nupon briefly in this chapter, but a more detailed discussion is given in Chapter 20.\n\nFor study purposes, it is convenient to place missions into categories based upon their\norbits. The following cover most applications:\n\n\u2022 Low Earth Orbit (LEO)\n\u2022 Medium height Earth orbit (MEO)\n\u2022 Geostationary Earth orbit (GEO)\n\u2022 Highly elliptical orbits (HEO)\n\u2022 Non-geocentric orbits (e.g. Lagrange points or interplanetary)\n\nThere is also a potentially increasing category embracing space stations, on-orbit servic-\ning and rescue. However, this chapter will focus on the five categories mentioned above\nsince they illustrate most of the aspects that link orbits to missions.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n112 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nA history of each mission may be viewed as a sequence of events starting at pre-launch\nand extending to end-of-life. The pre-launch phase includes all those operations that are\nrequired in order to effect launch vehicle ignition and separation from the umbilical cable\nbetween space system (spacecraft plus launcher) and the ground launch facilities.\n\nThe launch phase involves a sequence of events, many of which are pre-programmed\nand automatic. Careful planning is required for placing the spacecraft into an appropriate\nintermediate orbit from which the operational one may be attained. One evident constraint\nduring the launch phase is the requirement for continuous communications and tracking.\nThese facilities may be required for a ground-centre override to abort the mission, but\nalso there is generally a requirement to monitor the performance of a launch vehicle.\nFigure 5.1 shows the ground-centre network used for a typical Ariane 5 launch from the\nlaunch site in French Guiana.\n\nOrbit transfer is the next major event. This involves transferring the spacecraft from the\norbit into which the launch vehicle actually places it, to the one from which the operational\nphase of the mission can commence. There is a priori uncertainty in the orbit at launcher\nburn-out as given by the performance envelope of the launch vehicle (see Chapter 7); but\nthere is a posteriori uncertainty because of the orbit determination process that inevitably\nincludes some errors in the range and range-rate measurements of the spacecraft trajectory\n(see Chapter 4). Transfer between these orbits requires propellant, and it is the task of\nthe mission planners to determine how much is required in order to attain the desired\norbit from any given initial one, with a given level of confidence. This is particularly\nimportant for geostationary spacecraft, since the final operations needed to acquire their\norbit call for the use of a secondary propulsion system that may subsequently be used for\nattitude and orbit control. Excessive use or under-budgeting of fuel will therefore affect\nthe available payload mass and reduce the operational life of the space system as a whole.\n\n?60\n?40\n\n?35\n\n?30\n\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\nGalliot\n\nH2\n\nNatal\nAscension\n\nLibreville\n\nH3\nMalindi\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n?50 ?40 ?30 ?20 ?10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nFigure 5.1 Typical Ariane 5 ground track, showing launch monitoring ground stations.\nH2 indicates location of first stage engine shutdown and separation, and H3 indicates\nupper stage shutdown and injection point.

Fuel budgeting for\nstation-keeping and attitude control will be necessary.\n\nFor sky survey observatory missions, the scientific goals may require continuous chang-\ning of the orientation of the spacecraft in such a way that a wide variety of directions\nor even complete coverage of the celestial sphere may be achieved. Careful planning\nis required in order to optimize the observing programme; both the rate at which the\nspacecraft is reorientated and the angular distance through which its attitude is changed\nbetween observations will influence fuel consumption. Repointing operations are normally\nperformed using reaction wheels, with thrusters (propellant) being used to periodically\ndump angular momentum from the wheels (see Chapter 9). Whilst contingency plan-\nning is made for unscheduled repointing, many scientific missions inevitably cease only\nwhen the fuel has been exhausted. Other constraints that will be of concern in deriving\nmission profiles for scientific observatories include minimum sun/telescope angle, earth\nlimb/telescope angle, passage through the South Atlantic Anomaly in the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetosphere and thermal balance of the spacecraft and its sensors. Analysis and planning\nactivities associated with a number of specific types of mission during their operational\nphases are detailed in the following sections.\n\nDecommissioning the spacecraft is the final event associated with a space mission. In\nGEO, the demand for longitude slots is increasing, and thus an uncontrolled satellite in\nthis orbit is wasteful and also constitutes a collision hazard [1]. It has therefore become\ncommon practice to remove an obsolete spacecraft from GEO into a higher orbit by the\nuse of residual propellant in the secondary propulsion system at the end of its life. This\nmanoeuvre is frequently and appropriately called a \u2018graveyard burn\u2019. It is also becoming\nthe practice in LEO missions to provide a controlled re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\nor at least place it into an orbit with a reduced lifetime. The reason for this is that\nuncontrolled re-entry can lead to the vehicle breaking up, providing a hazard on the\nground and adding to the problem of space debris.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a key aspect of mission analysis is to identify critical features of\nthe mission, which have an impact upon system and subsystem design. Every space vehicle\nis required to meet specific mission objectives and these, thus provide design requirements.\n\nThe analysis of these, in the context of a particular spacecraft mission, usually leads\nto a subset of design requirements that are influential in shaping the whole configuration\nof the vehicle. These requirements are often referred to as design drivers . For example,\nthe thermal control system design may be routinely achieved, relatively speaking, in the\ncase of a GEO communications satellite. However, for an infrared astronomical obser-\nvatory spacecraft, it may become very influential in terms of governing the spacecraft\nconfiguration and operation (e.g. Herschel).\n\nTo illustrate briefly how mission design influences spacecraft system design, consider\nthe operation of a LEO spacecraft compared to one in GEO. At top level, the most\nobvious difference is the requirement for the GEO spacecraft to have primary propulsion\n(with the consequent impact upon the vehicle\u2019s mass budget) to achieve transfer from\nthe initial orbit to the operational orbit, whereas the LEO vehicle often has no need for\nthis. The LEO spacecraft will experience an eclipse each orbit period, whereas the GEO\nspacecraft remains in sunlight for the majority of its orbital lifetime. The rapid cycling\nof solar input experienced by the LEO spacecraft leads to differing design requirements,\nprincipally in the power and thermal control subsystem areas, compared to the GEO vehi-\ncles. The requirements in the communications subsystem areas (payload data, telemetry\n\n\n\n114 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nand command) are dissimilar for the two categories of mission in terms of both ground\nstation coverage and communications link budget. These simple examples illustrate well\nthe impact of the mission specification on the overall design of space vehicles.\n\nA further example, this time of an interplanetary mission, is the ESA/NASA space-\ncraft Ulysses [2]. The mission objective of this vehicle, launched by the Space Shuttle\nin October 1990, was to explore the interplanetary medium away from the plane of the\necliptic. The spacecraft was finally decommissioned in July 2009, after nearly 19 years of\noperation. Despite the longevity of the mission, it remains an excellent example in demon-\nstrating the interaction between the spacecraft mission and system design. To achieve the\nmission objective, the probe needed to be inserted into a heliocentric orbit, the plane of\nwhich was near-normal to that of the Earth\u2019s orbit about the Sun. To acquire such an orbit\na velocity increment (?V ) of the order of 30 km/s was required after Shuttle deployment.\nThis mission requirement became a principal design driver for the spacecraft. To achieve\nsuch a large ?V , two mission design options were available. The velocity would be\nacquired either by using an electrical propulsion system, or by using the gravitational\nfield of a major planet to swing the plane of the orbit out of the ecliptic (see Section 5.8.2\nfor details of swing-by trajectories). The latter option was chosen and the vehicle was\ninjected into a trajectory, which it took to Jupiter. A swing-by manoeuvre was then per-\nformed (in February 1992) over the Jovian pole to insert it into the required mission orbit.\nAs a consequence of this choice of mission, the design of the spacecraft\u2019s subsystems in\nnearly every respect (communications, thermal control, power raising, radiation harden-\ning, etc.) was profoundly influenced by the necessity for the visit to the relatively cold\nand distant Jovian environment.\n\nIt is important to appreciate that the attitude history of a space vehicle is inextricably\nlinked with the mission analysis. For example, an astronomical observatory spacecraft\nrequires to point the payload to specified regions of the celestial sphere, the communica-\ntions antenna to the ground, the solar array to the Sun, and possibly thermal radiators to\n\u2018deep space\u2019 (e.g. Hubble space telescope). Clearly for some spacecraft, pointing require-\nments can be very influential in shaping the vehicle configuration. The control of attitude\nbehaviour will be discussed in Chapter 9.\n\n5.2 KEPLERIAN ORBIT TRANSFERS\n\nThe situation frequently arises where a space vehicle must be transferred from one orbit\nto another. The detailed optimization of these manoeuvres is beyond the scope of this\ntext. (For detailed analysis, see for example References [3, 4].) However, it is appropriate\nto consider the nature of simple impulsive manoeuvres here, applied to Keplerian orbits.\n\nIf a single impulsive manoeuvre is performed, then the initial and final orbits intersect\nat the location of the manoeuvre; thus, a single manoeuvre may only transfer a vehicle\nbetween intersecting orbits. At least two manoeuvres will be required to transfer a vehicle\nbetween two non-intersecting orbits.\n\nA transfer from orbit A to an intersecting orbit B will occur if at some point, say r1,\nthe velocity vector is instantaneously changed from its value on orbit A to that which\nit would be on orbit B . The simplest case is that of a coplanar transfer from a circular\norbit to an elliptical orbit. If, on the circular orbit the velocity is increased, then the\nsemi-major axis will be expanded.\n\n\n\nKEPLERIAN ORBIT TRANSFERS 5.2 115\n\n2\n\n1\n\nV2\n\nV1 Vp\n\nr2\n\nr1\n\nVa\n\nFigure 5.2 Transfer velocity definitions\n\nA Hohmann transfer makes use of two such manoeuvres in order to transfer from\none circular orbit to a larger coplanar one, as shown in Figure 5.2. It is the minimum\nenergy, two-manoeuvre transfer, and is optimal (minimum velocity increment ?V ) if\nr2/r1 < 11.8.\n\nThe velocity increments needed for the two manoeuvres may be assessed by using the\nvis-viva integral equations (4.5) and (4.11). The first one requires an increase from the\ncircular orbit speed\n\n?\n(?/r1) to the speed Vp at the periapsis of the transfer ellipse, where\n\nV 2p = 2?\n{\n\n1\n\nr1\n? 1\n\nr1 + r2\n\n}\n\nThis represents a ?V given by\n\n?V =\n?(\n\n?\n\nr1\n\n){?(\n2r2\n\nr1 + r2\n\n)\n? 1\n\n}\n(5.1)\n\nA second, similar manoeuvre will transfer the vehicle into a circular orbit at apoapsis,\nwith a radius of r2.

They involve a change of direction for which the ?V requirement is\ngiven in Chapter 3, equation (3.21). This can involve appreciable use of fuel. If no change\nof speed is entailed, then the velocity increment required is proportional to the velocity\nat the time of the manoeuvre, and these transfers should, if possible, be performed when\nthe velocity is at a minimum. For example, to execute large plane changes of an Earth\norbit it is generally more efficient, from a propellant usage point of view, to perform the\nmanoeuvre at a large geocentric distance where the spacecraft is moving slowly. This\npoint will be developed later in this chapter.\n\n5.3 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nAs mentioned earlier, mission analysis is a \u2018front-end\u2019 systems level activity that takes\naspects such as payload operational requirements and spacecraft system constraints as\ninputs, and generates as an output the mission specification. Clearly, a central feature of\nthis process is the selection of the orbital parameters of the final mission orbit (as well\nas intermediate orbits during the early orbit-acquisition phase) that satisfy these require-\nments. It is important to note, however, that the mission specification also leads to design\nrequirements on the spacecraft systems and subsystems. For example, the attitude control\nsubsystem engineer can take the orbital characteristics and compute the on-orbit distur-\nbance torques produced for a given spacecraft configuration, which in turn determines\nthe angular momentum profile (see Chapter 9). It is these aspects that aid the engineer in\nproducing design specifications for the attitude actuators and sensors.\n\nAs can be seen, mission analysis is not just concerned with the celestial mechan-\nics discussed in Chapter 4, but also involves aspects governing operational and design\nissues, such as launch vehicle selection (see Chapter 7), ground station visibility, space-\ncraft ground coverage (see Section 5.5), eclipse duration (which impacts particularly on\nthe thermal control and power subsystem design) and orbital lifetime. Summarizing this\ndiscussion, we can conclude that the principal spacecraft design inputs come from the\npayload interface with the spacecraft and its operational requirements, the spacecraft\n\n\n\nMISSION ANALYSIS 5.3 117\n\ninterface with the launch vehicle, and the orbit. Clearly, the mission analyst has a major\nrole to play in this process. In this section, we will address some of these operational and\nsystem aspects related to the orbit.\n\n5.3.1 Ground station visibility\n\nA satellite is visible at all points on the Earth\u2019s surface within a circle that is centred on\nthe sub-satellite point, and whose diameter increases with satellite altitude (see Table 5.2).\nHowever, signals from satellites at the horizon limit are considerably attenuated by the\natmosphere, and so for practical purposes the surface coverage is restricted to the region in\nwhich the satellite elevation above the horizon is greater than ?5?. Figure 5.3 shows the\ngeometry associated with a satellite S in a circular orbit of height h , passing immediately\nover a ground station at G . If it is visible down to elevations equal to ?, typically 5? to\n10?, then the geocentric semi-angle ? over which it is visible is given by\n\n? = ?? + cos?1\n(\n\nRE\nRE + h cos ?\n\n)\n(5.3)\n\nTable 5.2 Relationship between satellite altitude, geocentric\nsemi-angle ? and slant range s\n\nAltitude h (km) Geocentric semi-angle ?

(5.4)\n\nThe duration of an overhead pass with semi-angle ? is\n\n? = 2?/?ES (5.5)\n\nwhere ?ES is the orbital angular velocity of the satellite relative to the Earth. ?ES may\nbe obtained from the Earth\u2019s angular rate ?E (7.3 \u00d7 10?5 rad/s) and the satellite\u2019s orbital\nrate ?, using\n\n?2ES = ?2E + ?2 ? 2?E? cos i (5.6)\n\nFor LEO, the error produced by using ? in place of ?ES in equation (5.5) (around 5 to\n10%) may be acceptable. For a circular orbit, ? in rad/s is given by 631(RE + h)?3/2,\nwhere RE and h are in km. For example, a satellite in a 500 km altitude orbit will have\nan elevation >5? for 9.2 min and >10? for 7.4 min during an overhead pass. Most passes\nwill be shorter than this.\n\nFor non-overhead passes, equation (5.5) may be used with ? in place of ?, where\n\n? = sin?1(sin2 ? ? tan2 ? cos2 ?)1/2\n\n? is now the geocentric semi-angle of the cone within which the spacecraft is visible\nfrom the ground site, defined by the minimum elevation ?\u2014as given by equation (5.3).\nHere the non-overhead pass orbit plane makes an angle ?\u2014measured at the Earth\u2019s\ncentre\u2014to the directly overhead one. Often non-overhead passes are characterized in\nterms of the maximum elevation ?max of the satellite. In this case, ? and ?max are related by\n\n? = cos?1\n[(\n\nRE\nRE + h\n\n)\ncos ?max\n\n]\n? ?max, ?max = tan?1\n\n[\ncot ? ?\n\n(\nRE\n\nRE + h\n)\n\ncosec ?\n\n]\n\n5.3.2 Eclipse duration\n\nA spacecraft in an Earth orbit will generally encounter an eclipse period . This is partic-\nularly the case for orbits at low altitudes. The frequency and duration of eclipse periods\nis strongly dependent on orbital inclination and altitude. For example, in a low-altitude,\nequatorial orbit, the satellite resides in the Earth\u2019s shadow for approximately 40% of\nevery orbit. Conversely, for dawn\u2013dusk sun-synchronous orbits (see Section 5.4), even\nat low altitude, several months of wholly sunlit operation may be obtained. Spacecraft in\nhighly elliptic orbits (see Section 5.7) with relatively low perigee altitudes will generally\nencounter eclipse periods when near the Earth. These are relatively brief however, com-\npared to the orbit period, because of the spacecraft\u2019s high speed in the perigee region.\nFor example, the eclipse period in a Molniya orbit varies from zero to a maximum\nof around 50 min (7% of orbit period), depending upon perigee height and season. In\nGeostationary Earth orbit (GEO) (see Section 5.6), a satellite spends most of its time in\nsunlight. The eclipse periods in this case are brief and depend on the season. In the period\n\n\n\nMISSION ANALYSIS 5.3 119\n\naround the solstices, the operation is eclipse-free, whereas near the Spring and Autumn\nequinox the satellite-Sun vector is near the orbit plane and eclipses are encountered with\ndurations up to a maximum of 72 minutes. This is still, however, a small fraction of the\ntotal orbit period of 24 h.\n\nThe calculation of the duration of eclipse is important from the point of view of\nthe spacecraft design. For example, if the spacecraft\u2019s primary power source is solar\narrays, backed up by a battery storage system, then the sizing of the power subsystem\nis strongly influenced by the length of the eclipse period (see Chapter 10). Similarly,\nthe thermal input to the spacecraft from the Sun is governed by the eclipse period and\nso influences the design of the thermal control subsystem (see Chapter 11). For some\norbits, such as circular orbits, which contain the Earth\u2013Sun vector, the eclipse duration\ncalculation is simple. However, in more general cases the process is more complicated\nand a computational technique is required.\n\nThe following outlines such a technique, and allows the computation of the eclipse\nperiod for a given orbit (defined generally by its Keplerian orbit elements) on any day\nof the year. This implied seasonal dependence is illustrated in Figure 4.9, which shows\nthe motion of the Earth\u2013Sun vector throughout the year. The unit dimensionless vector\ndefining the direction from the Earth to the Sun is given by\n\nrsun = cos L?i + sin L? cos ?j + sin L? sin ?k (5.7)\n\nwhere L? is the Sun\u2019s ecliptic longitude, measured East along the ecliptic from the vernal\nequinox (i axis), ? is the obliquity of the ecliptic (23.45?), and (i, j, k) defines the\ngeocentric inertial frame. The unit vector defining the direction to the satellite from the\nEarth\u2019s centre, in the same frame of reference, is given by\n\nrsat = [cos \t cos(? + ?) ? sin \t cos i sin(? + ?)]i (5.8)\n+ [sin \t cos(? + ?) + cos \t cos i sin(? + ?)]j + sin i sin(? + ?)k\n\nwhere the Keplerian elements have their usual notation. The criterion to establish whether\nthe satellite is in eclipse is illustrated in Figure 5.4. The angle ? that defines the entry\n\nOrbit\nEarth\nshadow\n\nEarth\n\nr\n\nRE\nr\n\nb\n\nFigure 5.4 Geometry illustrating orbit\u2019s intersection with the Earth\u2019s shadow\n\n\n\n120 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nand exit positions is given by\n? = sin?1(RE/r) (5.9)\n\nwhere RE is the Earth radius, and r is the geocentric distance of the spacecraft given\nby equations (4.7) and (4.8). Note that we have made simplifying assumptions (e.g. the\nEarth\u2019s shadow is cylindrical and the Earth is spherical). The satellite is in eclipse if the\nangle between rsat and the vector defining the anti-Sun direction ? = ?rsun is less than\nor equal to ?. This is expressed as\n\ncos?1(? \u00b7 rsat) ? ? (5.10)\n\nThe computational method to determine the eclipse period on a particular day of the\nyear is based on the following steps using equations (5.7) to (5.10):\n\n1. Evaluate ? = ?rsun from equation (5.7). An approximate value of L? can be\ncalculated in degrees from\n\nL? ? {(D ? D0)/365}360? (5.11)\n\nwhere D is the day number, assuming D = 0 is 0.0 h on 1 January (e.g. midday\non 2 January gives D = 1.5), and D0 = 79.0 (this assumes that the Northern Hemi-\nsphere Spring Equinox occurs at 0.0 h on 21 March). Clearly, equation (5.11) is\napproximate, and ignores complications such as leap years. However, it is adequate\nfor most design calculations. More precise expressions can be obtained, if required,\nfrom published solar ephemeris data.\n\n2. Cycle through values of true anomaly ? from 0? to 360? in steps of, say, 1? to\ncalculate ? and rsat at each step, and use the condition (5.10) to determine the\nvalues of ? at eclipse entry and exit. To save on computational effort, an initial\nsearch with a larger ? step (10? or 20? say) may be performed to find the eclipse\nregion (bearing in mind that the eclipse duration may be small or zero). If the\nentry and exit values are required to a greater accuracy than 1?, the values of ?\ncan be further subdivided in the computation in the entry and exit regions. This\nis recommended for spacecraft entering eclipse when at large geocentric distance,\nsince it will take a relatively long time period to traverse a 1? step in ? .\n\n3. Use equations (4.14), (4.18) and (4.19) to convert true anomaly values at entry and\nexit to eclipse duration.\n\nThe eclipse period of a typical Space Shuttle orbit (200 km altitude circular orbit,\ninclined at 28?) when the orbit plane contains the Earth\u2013Sun vector is 37.3 min, and the\nabove method gives 36.9 min for a 1? step in ? .\n\n5.3.3 Launch windows\n\nThe time of launch of a spacecraft is often constrained by dynamical aspects related to\nreaching the mission orbit, or by system requirements. Since the orbital plane is essentially\ninertially fixed, the satellite can be launched only as the launch site rotates through the\norbital plane. The limited interval of time during which launch can be effected is referred\nto as the launch window .\n\n\n\nMISSION ANALYSIS 5.3 121\n\nThe dynamical constraints are emphasized for launch into a LEO sun-synchronous orbit\n(see Section 5.4), for example, when the orbit\u2019s line of nodes must be set at a specified\nangle to the Earth-Sun vector. In this case, the launch window amounts to only a few\nminutes twice each day. Further, if there is a constraint on launch azimuth at the site, only\none of these opportunities may be possible. The execution of a launch through such a small\nwindow is a non-trivial exercise. For missions launched to rendezvous with an orbiting\nobject [e.g. International Space Station (ISS) transit missions], the dynamical issues are\nagain paramount, since there are not just geometrical constraints to consider, but also\ntemporal issues to do with phasing the launch to reach the target with minimum propellant.\n\nThe time of launch to acquire a GEO, on the other hand, is additionally constrained by\nsystems issues which usually lead to two launch opportunities each day around the launch\nsite midday and midnight. The launch window is constructed by combining constraints\nrelated to power raising, thermal control, sun-blinding of sensors, and so on, in the transfer\norbit. More detail is given in Section 5.6.1.\n\nFor interplanetary missions, the planetary alignment at launch becomes an issue in\ndefining the launch window. To illustrate this, consider a mission to Mars for which\nthe heliocentric trajectory is a Hohmann transfer (see Section 5.2). Figure 5.5 shows the\noutbound transfer orbit. If the mission leaves Earth at the point Edepart, then clearly Mars\nmust be at point Marrival when the spacecraft has traversed the transfer orbit. For this to\nbe the case, the position of Mars at the Earth departure time Mdepart is such that Mars\nmoves from Mdepart to Marrival in the same time as the spacecraft takes to execute half\na transfer orbit period (?259 days). This defines the illustrated planetary geometry at\nEarth departure time, with a heliocentric angle of ?45? between Earth and Mars. The\n\nMarrival\n\nMdepart  \n\nEarrival\n\nEdepart\n\nSun\n\n45\u00b0\n\n75\u00b0\n\nFigure 5.5 Planetary geometry at Earth departure and Mars arrival for a Hohmann\ntransfer mission\n\n\n\n122 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nopportunity to launch into a Hohmann trajectory is therefore limited by this planetary\nalignment, which recurs every 780 days (the Martian synodic period ?2.14 years). The\nplanetary alignment defines a launch window of approximately two weeks duration centred\naround the ideal departure time, and Earth rotation during this period will impose a further\nrestriction allowing launch for a relatively short period (? half hour to one hour) each\nday. The position of Earth Earrival at Mars arrival is determined in the same way, and\nallows an estimate of the communications distance. If the mission were to return on a\nHohmann transfer, the wait for the return launch window to open would mean that a stay\nat Mars of approximately 16 months would be required.\n\n5.3.4 Orbit lifetime\n\nFor LEO vehicles, aerodynamic drag will eventually result in re-entry as described in\nChapter 4, Section 4.4.2. To the accuracy of a few per cent the lifetime of an uncontrolled\nspace vehicle will be\n\n? ? e\n2\n0\n\n2B\n\n(\n1 ? 11\n\n6\ne0 + 29\n\n16\ne20 +\n\n7\n\n8\n\nH\n\na0\n\n)\n(5.12)\n\nwhere e0 and a0 are the initial values of eccentricity and semi-major axis once control\nhas ceased, H is the scale height of the atmosphere near perigee and B is given by\n\nB ?\n????\n\n(\n?\n\na30\n\n)\nACD\nM\n\n?p0a0e0I1\n(a0e0\n\nH\n\n)\nexp\n\n(\n?e0\n\n(\n1 + a0\n\nH\n\n))\n(5.13)\n\nThis expression neglects the effects of atmospheric rotation. I1 is the Bessel function of\nthe first kind and order 1 and ?p0 is the atmospheric density at the initial perigee. A\nmore elaborate treatment may be found in Reference [5]. For large space vehicles and\nfor military vehicles, re-entry may cause problems as a result of both the geographical\nposition of the re-entry corridor and the size of individual spacecraft elements on ground\nimpact. Most notably, the effect on the public of Skylab re-entry over Australia, and\nCosmos 943B over Canada, provide historical evidence of some of the problems that\nmay be encountered in re-entry.\n\n5.4 POLAR LEO/REMOTE-SENSING SATELLITES\n\n5.4.1 Mission orbit design\n\nThe choice of orbit for a LEO remote sensing spacecraft is governed by the mission\nobjectives and payload operational requirements. To achieve near-global coverage, the\nplane of the orbit must be inclined at about 90? to the Earth\u2019s equator. In this near-polar\norbit, the spacecraft ground track will span a latitude coverage of \u00b1i for prograde orbits,\nwhere i is the orbital inclination.\n\nIn terms of orbit altitude, this is principally established by a trade-off between instru-\nment resolution and the fuel required to maintain the orbit in the presence of aerodynamic\n\n\n\nPOLAR LEO/REMOTE-SENSING SATELLITES 5.4 123\n\ntE\n\nE\nW\n\n?f\n\nFigure 5.6 Orbit plane motion\n\ndrag. For civil remote sensing systems, which are required to operate for an extended\nperiod, an altitude typically of the order of 600 to 900 km results. It is worth noting, how-\never, that the mission requirements for military surveillance spacecraft may be different,\nleading to more complex operational scenarios.\n\nOther payload-derived requirements often demand that the mission orbit be Earth-\nsynchronous , or Sun-synchronous , and sometimes both (e.g. SPOT). These further\nconstrain the choice of orbit inclination and height in a manner that is discussed in more\ndetail below.\n\nConsequently, for viewing all parts of the Earth\u2019s surface at close quarters it is necessary\nto adopt a low-altitude polar orbit. With the orbit fixed in space and the Earth rotating\nunderneath it, the result is that the ground tracks of successive orbits cross the equator at\npoints that move westward as shown in Figure 5.6.\n\nAn Earth-synchronous orbit results when the sub-satellite point follows a ground track\nidentical to some previous orbit after a certain period of time. This need occurs as a result\nof a payload-derived requirement to revisit ground target sites or regions. The repetition\noccurs on a regular basis, and it can be achieved in a variety of ways. (A geosynchronous\norbit is of course another example of an Earth-synchronous orbit.) Between successive\norbits, the sub-satellite point on the equator will change in longitude by ?? radians, this\nangle being determined by two effects. The first of these is as a result of the rotation\nof the Earth beneath the orbit, and the second is caused by nodal regression. It will be\nassumed that a positive ?? means a move towards the east.\n\nThe Earth rotates through one revolution in its sidereal period of ?E , where\n?E = 86 164.1 s, neglecting small secular variations. This sidereal period of 23 h 56 min\nis with respect to the stars. The rotation period with respect to the Sun is of course the\nmean solar day of 24 h. If the satellite\u2019s nodal period is ? , then the contributions to ??,\nwhich is caused by the Earth\u2019s rotation, will be given by\n\n??1 = ?2? ?\n?E\n\nrad/orbit (5.14)\n\nThe regression of the line of nodes (equation 4.37) contributes\n\n??2 = ?3?J2R\n2\nE cos i\n\na2(1 ? e2)2 rad/orbit (5.15)\n\n\n\n124 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nThe total increase in longitude at the equator is\n\n?? = ??1 + ??2 rad/orbit (5.16)\n\nClearly, if we wish to have an Earth-synchronous orbit, then we will require that some\ninteger number of orbits later the accumulated value of ?? will equal 2? . In general, we\nmay, therefore, write\n\nn|??| = m2? (5.17)\n\nwhere n is the total number of orbits performed and m is the number of Earth revolutions\n(equivalent to days) before an identical ground track will occur.\n\nSun-synchronism occurs when the orbit plane rotates in space at the same rate as the\nEarth moves round the Sun\u2014at one revolution per year, or roughly one degree per day\neastwards. Figure 5.7 illustrates this over a period of about three months, during which\nthe orbit clearly needs to rotate through 90? in order to be synchronous.\n\nThe required rotation rate is\n\n??2 = 2? ?E\n?ES\n\n?\n\n?E\nrad/orbit (5.18)\n\nwhere ?ES = 3.155 815 \u00d7 107 s is the orbital period of Earth round the Sun.\nFrom this discussion, it can be seen that when an orbit is Sun-synchronous, the relative\n\ngeometry of the Earth\u2013Sun vector and the orbit plane remains approximately constant\nthroughout the year. This implies that spacecraft in such orbits pass over particular ground\nsites at the same local solar times each day (one pass in daylight and one at night).\nThe need for Sun-synchronism for some remote sensing missions is a payload-derived\nrequirement to use this attribute. The operator of such a vehicle will often focus interest on\na particular geographical region. By an appropriate choice of orbit-node position (equator\ncrossing) with respect to the Earth\u2013Sun vector, the solar aspect on the ground can be\nchosen optimally to fulfil the remote sensing mission objectives. This advantage of Sun-\nsynchronous orbits is illustrated in Figure 5.8.\n\nIn general, configuration (a) is unattractive for Earth viewing since the Sun is always low\non the horizon at the sub-satellite point, resulting in long shadows and low illumination.\nIndeed, during winter in the northern hemisphere the ground-track is in darkness while\n\nSun\n\nEarth\n\nP\n\nP ?\nP ?P ??\n\nP\nP\n\nq\nq\n\nFigure 5.7 Sidereal and solar motion\n\n\n\nPOLAR LEO/REMOTE-SENSING SATELLITES 5.4 125\n\nSun Sun Sun\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nDawn/dusk orbit\n- along terminator\n\nMid-afternoon/\nnight orbit\n\nNoon/midnight\norbit\n\n(short shadows)\n\nFigure 5.8 Implications of changing local time coverage\n\nthe spacecraft is north of the equator. However, the orbit is attractive for the power\nsubsystem as it provides lengthy eclipse-free periods, making energy storage minimal,\nand the array may be fixed relative to the body of the vehicle. Further, since the array\nis aligned along the direction of flight, a minimum projected area to the velocity vector\nof the satellite is obtained, thus reducing the influence of drag and increasing satellite\nlifetime. For the noon\u2013midnight orbit (c), remotely sensed images have low definition\ndue to short shadows on the ground, and the payload sensors may experience specular\nreflection from sea surfaces. The choice of orbit plane is usually a compromise, as shown\nin Figure 5.8(b).\n\nThe other feature to note about Sun-synchronous orbits is that since the orbit plane is\nfixed relative to the solar vector it is possible to cant the array relative to the spacecraft\nbody, providing optimal illumination conditions for the solar array.\n\nTo achieve Sun-synchronism, the Earth-oblateness perturbation governing the regression\nof the line of nodes may be used without the use of fuel. Equation (5.15) indicates that\nan inclination in excess of 90? will be needed.\n\nFor Sun and Earth synchronism equations (5.16) to (5.18) apply, and these lead to\nthe condition\n\nn?\n\n(\n1 ? ?E\n\n?ES\n\n)\n= m?E (5.19)\n\nThe angular displacement between successive orbits in a westward direction is given by\n\n?? = 2??\n(\n\n1\n\n?ES\n? 1\n\n?E\n\n)\n= ?7.27 \u00d7 10?5? rad (5.20)\n\nFrom equation (4.12) we have\n\n? = 9.952 \u00d7 10?3a3/2 seconds (5.21)\n\n(where a is in kilometres). Since for remote sensing satellites in LEO the altitude is\napproximately 600 to 900 km, then ? ? 96 to 103 min, and so |??| ? 4.3 \u00d7 10?1 rad.\n\n\n\n126 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\n20\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n200 300 400 500 600\n\nAltitude (km)\n\nR\nep\n\nea\nt p\n\ner\nio\n\nd \n(d\n\nay\ns)\n\n700 800 900\n\nZero drift orbits\n\nn = 16 n = 15 n = 14\n\nMinimum\ndrift orbit\n\nFigure 5.9 Locus of points for minimum drift orbits as a function of repeat period in\ndays (m) and altitude\n\nAt the equator, this translates into a distance of ?2800 km between ground tracks, although\nthis decreases at higher latitudes. It is clear from this that wide instrument swath-widths\nwill be required if complete Earth coverage is to be obtained. By extending the period\nbetween repetitions for a given set of ground tracks, a more densely packed set may be\nachieved. For example, if the requirement is for a daily repeat (m = 1) of a set of (n =)\n14, 15 or 16 tracks, then from equations (5.19) and (5.21), it may be deduced that the\ncorresponding orbit altitudes are 894, 567 and 275 km, respectively. More precisely, if\naccount is taken of the higher order effects of Earth oblateness on the spacecraft\u2019s nodal\nperiod, then these altitudes become 888, 561 and 268 km, respectively. This type of orbit\nis known as a zero drift orbit, and has no infilling between ground tracks on subsequent\ndays. A greater density of tracks may be achieved by infilling the tracks of Day 1 on\nsubsequent days. The cycle repeats itself over a number of days in excess of one (m > 1),\nwith a number (n) of tracks, which is not a multiple of m .\n\nIf the condition (n \u00b1 1)/m = k is satisfied, where k is an integer, then a minimum\ndrift orbit is obtained. In this situation, two successive tracks of a given day are infilled\nsequentially on subsequent days. Non-minimum drift orbits, (n \u00b1 1)/m ?= k , infill in a\nnon-sequential manner.\n\nSince ? is a function of altitude (equation 5.21), it is possible to plot the repeat period\nof Earth synchronization versus altitude. This, for minimum drift orbits, is shown in\nFigure 5.9. As an example, SPOT5 was launched into a 26 day repeat period, non-\nminimum drift orbit in May 2002. The SPOT (Satellite Pour l\u2019Observation de la Terre)\nspacecraft series are the space segment of a French national remote sensing programme.\nThe characteristics of the orbit are\n\n\u2022 Sun- and Earth-synchronous\n\u2022 Ground track repeat cycle (m , n) = (26, 369)\n\n\n\nSATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS 5.5 127\n\n\u2022 Orbit parameters.\nsemi-major axis a = 7200 km (height ?822 km, period ? = 101.3 min)\neccentricity e ? 0, inclination i = 98.7?\nNode time (descending) = 10.30 local solar time (LST)\n\nAt the equator the separation between successive orbits is 2838 km. However, over\nthe 26-day repeat period, this separation is filled-in (non-sequentially) so that the distance\nbetween adjacent ground tracks is reduced to 2?RE/n ? 108.6 km. This ground repetition\ngeometry was chosen to ensure that the SPOT imaging system, with a nominal swath-\nwidth of 117 km, can achieve global coverage.\n\n5.5 SATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS\n\n5.5.1 Introduction\n\nThe use of constellations of satellites to achieve a mission objective is by no means a new\nphenomenon. For example, the United States Department of Defence (DoD) deployed the\nTRANSIT system in the 1960s, which comprised a constellation of spacecraft in polar\norbits. This was used principally by US Naval ships to determine position. Because\nof the way the fix was determined (tracking the range rate of a single satellite), the\nsystem was unsuitable for navigation of highly dynamic vehicles, such as aircraft or\nmissiles. This constraint was removed, however, with the implementation of another US\nmilitary navigation system, the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation.\nThis has had a major impact on both military and civilian sectors. To satisfy global\ncoverage requirements, the nominal GPS constellation comprises 24 satellites deployed\nin 6 orbit planes, inclined at 55? to the equator. Each orbit plane contains 4 spacecraft,\nequally spaced in true anomaly, and the node of each plane is spaced equally in right\nascension around the equator. Each orbit is near-circular, and has an orbit period of half\na sidereal day (height ?20 200 km). A similar system\u2014GLObal NAvigation Satellite\nSystem (GLONASS )\u2014was deployed concurrently by the former Soviet Union, primarily\nfor military use. This also comprises 24 satellites, but this time with 8 satellites in each\nof 3 planes with an inclination of 65?.\n\nThe prime stimulus of interest in LEO constellations, particularly during the last decade\nof the twentieth century, has been their use for global data and communication ser-\nvices. Satellite communications were formerly based principally on GEO systems (see\nSection 5.6), relaying data between relatively large, fixed ground stations. However,\nthe perceived market for personal communications led to the consideration of satellites\ndeployed in LEO to reduce the slant range, and therefore the required radiated power of\nthe user terminal (phone) to physiologically acceptable levels. This simple driver gave\nrise to a large number of proposals for personal global communication systems , on the\nbasis of LEO constellation configurations. Some of these proposals have become a real-\nity, for example ORBCOMM , IRIDIUM and GLOBALSTAR, and others are to be built\nimminently (at the time of writing). For example, the IRIDIUM constellation comprised\n66 satellites (plus one spare per plane) deployed at 780 km altitude in 6 equally spaced\norbit planes, inclined at 86.4? to the equator.\n\n\n\n128 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nThis activity was dampened somewhat by the unfortunate financial demise of the\nIRIDIUM system around 1999. However, these problems were overcome, and the system\noperation was resumed soon afterwards. The overall trend is now one of growth, and the\nmood one of optimism. Although communication systems have led the trend, other appli-\ncations for LEO constellation systems are being proposed and implemented. These are\ncivilian and military remote sensing systems. As sensor technology progresses resulting in\ngreater spatial resolution, the next step is the improvement of temporal resolution through\nthe use of constellations. One aspect that inhibits this development is, of course, the cost\ninvolved in launching multiple satellites. This, however, is offset to some degree by the\ndevelopment in recent years of capable, small satellites, and their use in constellations.\nThis theme is developed further in Chapter 18.\n\nAt the mission design phase of a project, there is the need to determine whether the\nobjectives can be achieved with a single satellite or a constellation. The main advantage of\na single spacecraft is clear\u2014the cost benefit of a single build, launch and operations activ-\nity. On the other hand, a collection of satellites in a constellation will offer considerable\nimprovements in coverage, in reliability \u2014the system will degrade more gracefully in the\nevent of a failure, and survivability in the case of a military system. In some instances,\nthe requirements make the choice of a constellation mandatory\u2014for example, the Navstar\nGPS user must be able to see at least four spacecraft with a diverse line-of-sight geometry\nto acquire a good navigational fix.\n\nOnce the need for a constellation is clear, the design of its geometry is a non-trivial\nproblem, since there are a large number of possibilities (see Section 5.5.3). Since cov-\nerage is the prime benefit derived from a constellation, the choice normally involves a\ntrade-off using coverage (as a measure of performance) against the number of spacecraft\n(as a measure of cost). However, even this process is not straightforward. For example,\na constellation with t + 1 members may exhibit a step function in improved performance\nover one with t members, but the larger constellation may be deployed at a lower height\nor inclination, so reducing the cost of launch.\n\n5.5.2 Ground coverage\n\nFigure 5.10 shows a typical ground coverage geometry, with the satellite at height h . The\n\u2018viewing angle\u2019 of the payload is 2?. This may be the field of view of an imaging system\nor the beamwidth of a communications antenna. This defines a circle of coverage on the\nground of geocentric semi-angle ? and diameter D km. The satellite elevation and slant\nrange at the edge of coverage (useful concepts for communications missions) are ? and\n?, respectively.\n\nFrom Figure 5.10, we have\n\n? = ?/2 ? ? ? ? (5.22)\n\nand (as seen in Section 5.3.1),\n\n? = ?? + cos?1\n(\n\nRE\nRE + h cos ?\n\n)\n(5.23)\n\n\n\nSATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS 5.5 129\n\nG\n\nG?  \n\nO \n\nSatellite\nS \n\nh \n\nRE \nEarth\n\nDistance over the ground GG?  = D = coverage diameter.\n\nf\n\ne\n\na\n\nr\n\nFigure 5.10 Typical ground coverage geometry\n\nThe coverage diameter is then\nD = 2?RE (5.24)\n\nwith ? in radians, and the slant range is given by\n\n? = RE\n(\n\nsin ?\n\nsin(?/2 ? ? ? ?)\n)\n\n(5.25)\n\nFrom these geometrical considerations, it is possible to relate coverage aspects to orbit\nheight and payload characteristics.\n\nA further issue is the degree of coverage required. For example, for communications\nmissions, the user may require to \u2018see\u2019 just one satellite at any time to enable the service.\nHowever, as mentioned above, the Navstar GPS user requires multiple coverage \u2014in\nthis case four-fold coverage. Line of sight to at least four spacecraft is required at any\ntime, to acquire the information needed to solve four unknowns\u2014the three components\nof the user\u2019s position, plus the offset between the GPS satellite time and the user\u2019s\nclock. Figure 5.11 illustrates the concept of multiple coverage. The central horizontal\nline represents one orbit plane in the constellation and the dots denote the s satellites\nin that plane. The integers give the instantaneous levels of multiple coverage within\nthe intersecting circles of coverage. The figure also illustrates the concept of streets of\ncoverage, introduced in Reference [6] and developed by Adams and Rider [7], which is\nuseful in analysing constellation systems requiring multiple levels of coverage. The street\nwidth giving j -fold coverage is given by\n\ndj = 2 cos?1(cos ?/cos(j?/s)), j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , s ? 3 (5.26)\n\nwhere s is the number of satellites in each orbit plane. It should be noted that multiple\ncoverage can also be provided by the overlapping of streets of coverage from neighbouring\norbit planes, particularly at high latitudes where orbit planes converge.\n\nCoverage is often the crucial issue when deciding upon a constellation geometry. Cov-\nerage statistics can be accumulated by numerical simulation of the candidate constellation\ndesigns and an appropriate coverage figure of Merit devised to distinguish between them.\n\n\n\n130 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nd3 d2 d1 \n\nSatellite \n2p/s \n\n  \n\n1 1 1 1 \n2 2 2 \n\n3 3 3 \n\n4 4 4 f\nTriple\n\ncoverage \n\nDouble\ncoverage\n\nSingle\ncoverage\n\nFigure 5.11 Constellation orbit plane geometry, illustrating multiple coverage and\n\u2018streets of coverage\u2019\n\n5.5.3 Constellation geometries\n\nAs seen below, there are a large number of possible constellation configurations that may\nsatisfy a particular mission requirement. One factor that is common to the majority of\nthese designs, however, is the invariance of the constellation geometry when subjected to\norbital perturbations. In other words, it is usually the case that the orbit of each member\nsatellite is similar in terms of height, eccentricity and inclination, so that each orbit is\nperturbed by the effects described in Chapter 4, Section 4.4 in the same manner (to first\norder). In this way, the constellation geometry can be preserved without recourse to an\nexcessive station-keeping requirement. Generally, the only acceptable exception to this is\nthe combination of inclined and equatorial orbit planes in a constellation design.\n\nA further factor that should be considered in the design is the use of appropriate phasing\nof the member satellites within each orbit plane to ensure that collisions are avoided at\norbit plane intersections. This is dealt with in some detail in Reference [7]. The most\ncommonly considered constellation designs are described below.\n\nWalker Delta pattern constellation . This geometry, first proposed by Walker [8, 9],\ncan be uniquely specified by a small number of parameters; namely, the total number of\nsatellites t , the number of orbit planes p, an integer f that determines the relative spacing\nbetween satellites in adjacent planes, and finally the orbit inclination i . Therefore, the\nDelta pattern denoted by\n\ni : t/p/f , 0 ? f ? (p ? 1)\n\ncomprises a design with p orbit planes, the ascending nodes of which are equally spaced\nin right ascension. All orbits are nominally circular, and of the same height and incli-\nnation. Each orbit plane contains s(= t/p) satellites, equally spaced in true anomaly.\nTo define the phasing of satellites within the pattern, Walker introduced a \u2018pattern unit\u2019\nPU = 360?/t . The relative phasing is defined by the condition that, if a satellite is at its\nascending node, then the satellite in the next most-Easterly plane will be f \u00d7 PU past\nits node. An example, specified by 55?:25/5/1, is illustrated in Figure 5.12, in which the\nPU = 360?/25 = 14.4?. In the figure, satellite one is positioned at its ascending node, with\nsatellite six, therefore, one PU beyond its nodal position in the next most-Easterly plane.\n\n\n\nSATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS 5.5 131\n\n6\n1\n\nFigure 5.12 A Walker Delta pattern constellation, defined by 55?: 25 / 5 / 1\n\nN\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSynchronized\norbits\n\nNon-\nsynchronized\n\norbits\n\nb\n\nb b b\n\nb\ny\n\nFigure 5.13 Illustration of a six-plane polar constellation\n\nn-plane polar constellations . As the name suggests, this design comprises n orbit\nplanes, each of which is of polar (or near-polar) inclination. Distributed within each\nof the n planes is an equal number of satellites. Walker [8] originally referred to this\ntype of geometry as a (Walker) \u2018Star pattern\u2019 constellation. Figure 5.13 shows, as an\nexample, the geometry of a six-plane polar constellation, as viewed when looking down\non the North Pole of the Earth. As can be seen, most adjacent orbits are \u2018synchronized\u2019\nin that the satellites are co-rotating. However, by necessity two adjacent planes must be\n\u2018non-synchronized\u2019, in which the satellites are counter-rotating. The manner in which the\ncoverage is achieved in these two situations is dissimilar, and generally leads to different\nnodal spacing of the orbit planes.\n\nConsequently, the n-plane polar constellation is not an example of a Walker Delta\npattern. Also, given the general convergence of the orbit planes at the poles, issues of\nin-plane phasing become critical to avoid collisions, which in turn can further affect\ncoverage. A good example of the development of an n-plane polar constellation for a\npersonal communication satellite system with global coverage is given by Benedicto et al.\n[10]. This demonstrates well, the interactions between coverage and satellite/orbit-node\nseparation. Figure 5.14 illustrates their solutions, specifying the total number of satellites\nrequired as orbit height varies, for minimum \u2018edge of coverage\u2019 elevations of 10?, 30?\n\n\n\n132 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nOrbital height (km)\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n s\n\nat\nel\n\nlit\nes\n\n105104103102\n\nE = 10 deg\n\nE = 30 deg\n\nE = 50 deg\n\nFigure 5.14 Number of satellites as a function of orbit height and minimum elevation.\nReproduced by permission of ESA (authors: J. Benedicto et al.) (from Reference [10])\n\nand 50?. This clearly demonstrates the strong dependence of the total number of satellites\nt on orbital altitude h , which is a general feature of constellations.\n\nGeometries for regional coverage. The geometries discussed so far are useful candidates\nif global coverage is a requirement. However, if regional coverage is needed, a simpler\nconstellation geometry should be sought, to gain the cost benefit of deploying fewer\nspacecraft. It is easy to see, for example, that coverage required within say 20? or 30?\nlatitude of the equator, can be fulfilled by a number of satellites phased in true anomaly\nin an equatorial orbit. Similarly, regional coverage of the polar caps may be achieved\nby satellites optimally distributed in one (or two) near-polar orbits. To optimize coverage\nat mid-latitudes (30? to 60?), a region containing Europe, North America, the CIS, S.\nAustralia and Japan, recourse to a number of orbit planes inclined at ?55? to the equator\nmay suffice. This utilizes the useful tendency for neighbouring orbits to converge at their\nNorthern and Southern apexes. Consideration can also be given to the use of eccentric\norbits when seeking solutions to regional coverage problems, bearing in mind the need\nto preserve the geometry when subjected to natural perturbations.\n\n5.5.4 Design issues\n\nIn terms of constellation design, there are unfortunately no general rules to aid the designer\nin solving what is often a complex problem. The only semblance of a rule is perhaps the\nabove-mentioned invariance of the geometry with respect to perturbations. However, even\nthis was not considered a constraint by the designers of the ORBCOMM constellation,\nwhich remarkably exhibits a variety of orbit heights and inclination.\n\n\n\nGEOSTATIONARY EARTH ORBITS (GEO) 5.6 133\n\nAn observation that may assist in the design process is that there is often an advantage\nin deploying more satellites in fewer orbit planes. Underlying this statement is the relative\nease with which spacecraft can be moved within an orbit plane, compared to the difficulty\nof moving them from one plane to another. The former involves a small, in-plane phasing\nmanoeuvre, whereas the latter requires a prohibitively expensive plane change manoeu-\nvre. In a constellation with p orbit planes, performance plateaux occur with the launch\nof the first satellite, then with one satellite in each plane, and so on. The major plateaux\ntherefore occur with the launch of 1, p, 2p, 3p, . . . satellites. Clearly, these plateaux occur\nmore frequently, and with fewer spacecraft when the number of planes p is small, giving a\ncost benefit. Similarly, when considering satellite failures within a constellation, there is a\ngreater degree of graceful degradation in performance in systems with fewer orbit planes.\nFor example, in a system with t satellites, equally distributed in p planes, there are s = t/p\nsatellites in each plane. If a satellite was to fail, then the whole constellation could be re-\nphased with little cost, to a configuration with s ? 1 satellites in each plane, corresponding\nto the p(s ? 1) performance plateau. Lower values of p again give benefits when consid-\nering degradation. However, despite these comments, it is often the coverage requirements\nthat dictate the number of orbit planes, so that low values of p may not be possible.\n\n5.6 GEOSTATIONARY EARTH ORBITS (GEO)\n\nThe utility of the geostationary orbit for providing global communications was first noted\nby Arthur C. Clarke [11]. Its primary attribute is that the sub-satellite point is fixed at a\nselected longitude, with 0? latitude. It does not have dynamic tracking problems. GEO\nspacecraft may therefore provide fixed-point to fixed-point communications to any site\nwithin the beam of their antennas. Figure 5.15(a) shows the horizon as viewed from\nGEO, and the region over which the satellite appears with an elevation in excess of 10?;\nFigure 5.15(b) demonstrates that only three satellites are required to provide almost a\nglobal communications network.\n\nHorizon incidence\n81.3\u00b0 N\n71.2\u00b0 N (10\u00b0 elevation)\n60\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0\n\nEquator\n\n(a) Coverage of one satellite\n\nEquatorial\n coverage\n18 250 km\n\n35\n.8\n\n \u00d7\n 1\n\n03\n k\n\nm\n\n73.2 \u00d7 103 km\n\n(b) 3 Geostationary satellites ? earth coverage\n\n17\u00b0\n\n163\u00b0\n\nFigure 5.15 Geostationary views of the Earth (a) coverage of one satellite and (b)\n\u2018global\u2019 coverage using three satellites\n\n\n\n134 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nThe 24-hour geostationary orbit clearly offers unique advantages, providing almost\ncomplete global coverage (except for the immediate polar regions) from merely three\nsatellites, and with no need for the ground antenna to switch between satellites. A potential\ndisadvantage of GEO communication systems is the time delay for a transmission to reach\nits destination. This is clearly less of a problem for data services (e.g. internet, e-mail,\netc.) than for live speech.\n\nFor a service of high quality and reliability, it is necessary to consider the control\nand replacement policy for a GEO spacecraft. The failure of a spacecraft would cause\nsubstantial financial penalties to the system operator, and since the ability to replace it\nis dependent on launcher availability, with substantial time being needed, the philosophy\nof having an in-orbit spare is frequently adopted. This spare is at a slightly different\nlongitude, and offers the advantage of extra capacity should it be required.\n\nMaintaining a spacecraft\u2019s orbit is an essential requirement for maintaining a commu-\nnication link. The capability and method of achieving GEO and maintaining a specific\nlocation will now be discussed and fuel requirements for station-keeping will be indicated.\n\n5.6.1 Geostationary orbit acquisition\n\nThe final stage of the launch vehicle will place the satellite in a nominal orbit. During the\n1980s, the US Space Shuttle was used to launch commercial geostationary communication\nspacecraft. In order to make up the launcher\u2019s payload complement, typically two or\nthree such spacecraft were launched at a time. In more recent times, the Shuttle has been\nused to launch large science, communications or military payloads that warrant its large\nlift capability, some of which were destined for GEO. However, with the anticipated\nretirement of the Space Shuttle system in 2011, conventional expendable launch vehicles\n(ELVs) will take over its role for the foreseeable future.\n\nAn Ariane 5 launch scenario, for example, is typical although the details may differ\ndepending upon which ELV is considered. The final stage of the Ariane 5 launcher places\nthe satellite directly into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), after a powered flight of the\norder of ?27 min. The GTO is an elliptical orbit with an apogee near geostationary altitude\n(?35 786 km), a perigee height between 200 and 650 km altitude, and an inclination of\n7? to the equator. Further, the apogee of the GTO must occur at an orbit node (equator\ncrossing) so that subsequently a single firing of an apogee boost motor (ABM) may both\ncircularize and change the plane to become equatorial.\n\nSeveral transfer orbit revolutions occur before injection of the satellite into a\nnear-circular, near-GEO orbit. This period is essential for attitude manoeuvres and\ndetermination, and for tracking the satellite and determining its orbit before the ABM\nis fired. This motor increases the velocity of the satellite from ?1.6 km/s to ?3 km/s\nat apogee. Some satellites may be spin-stabilized during the entire transfer and orbit-\nacquisition phase, although vehicles using liquid apogee engines (low thrust) may be\nthree-axis-stabilized. The GTO attitude and orbit control activities, and consequently the\nlaunch window (see Section 5.3.3), are very much dependent on the particular spacecraft\nand its system constraints. When specifying the time of launch, however, the constraints\nconsidered generally include\n\n\u2014 the duration of eclipse periods, and the exposure of sufficient solar array surface to\nthe Sun (particularly for spin-stabilized spacecraft) to ensure adequate power\n\n\n\nGEOSTATIONARY EARTH ORBITS (GEO) 5.6 135\n\n\u2014 the Sun-relative attitude, and eclipse durations, to ensure thermal control can\nbe maintained\n\n\u2014 the relative Sun-Earth-spacecraft geometry, to ensure that the vehicle\u2019s sensors can\nprovide information of adequate accuracy for attitude determination\n\n\u2014 Sun blinding of sensors and so on.\n\nFor spinners, the orientation of the spin axis, and its control during motor firings, is\nparticularly crucial not only for reasons of orbit attainment but also for power raising and\nthermal control. These latter constraints typically require a local midday or local midnight\napogee firing to take place since the spin axis will be oriented along the thrust vector (see\nFigure 5.16).\n\nSpin axis\n\nApogee motor\n\nPermitted direction\nof sunlight\n\nApogee\nLaunch\n\nMidday\nlaunch\nwindow\n\nApogee\nLaunch\n\nMidnight\nlaunch\nwindow\n\nFigure 5.16 Vehicle orientation for injection\n\n\n\n136 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nFor vehicles that utilize a liquid apogee motor (LAM), a single firing at apogee is\ninsufficient to transfer the vehicle into the desired near-GEO orbit. The low thrust of such\nmotors (?102 N rather than ?104 N for a solid rocket) would result in the need to rotate\nthe thrust axis during firing in order to deliver the required impulse. Instead, typically\nnumber of firings of the LAM are utilized during successive apogee transits. As mentioned\nabove, these apogee manoeuvres not only circularize the transfer orbit, but also rotate\nit into the equatorial plane. The cost of this plane change is directly proportional to the\nGTO inclination, so that the low inclination of the Ariane transfer orbit, for example, is\npreferable in this respect. To further reduce the ?v of this composite apogee manoeuvre,\na supersynchronous transfer orbit is often used, which has an apogee in excess of the\nGEO altitude. Since the spacecraft moves more slowly at this higher altitude, the cost\nof the plane change is reduced. An additional in-plane burn is then required to lower the\napogee, but the overall propellant mass can be reduced using this strategy.\n\nIf the one-impulse solid propellant ABM is used, there is a requirement to place the\nsatellite into a slightly elliptical orbit, termed a drift orbit, whose apogee is at GEO altitude.\nIts period is less than the GEO period, the precise value being chosen to minimize the ?V\nrequirements, whilst maintaining a reasonable GEO attainment strategy. As a consequence,\nthe satellite progressively drifts eastward. Through a sequence of manoeuvres in both\nlatitude and longitude, it is eventually brought to rest at the required GEO location.\nThese manoeuvres are similar to those described below for station-keeping. Final station\nacquisition may be up to a month after satellite launch. Table 5.3 summarizes some of\nthe attributes of the LAM [12].\n\n5.6.2 GEO station-keeping requirements\n\nThe primary disturbances on a satellite orbit were described in Chapter 4. The dominant\neffects for GEO are luni-solar perturbations, Earth triaxiality and solar radiation pressure.\n\nTable 5.3 Characteristics of the liquid apogee motor for GEO acquisition (\n?\n\ndenotes\nadvantage, \u00d7 denotes disadvantage)\n\nAttribute Comments\n\nMultiple engine restarts possible Burn can be segmented\n?\n\nLonger duration motor firings Lower acceleration\n?\n\nReduced efficiency \u00d7\nBurn duration controllable Improved reaction to launcher errors\n\n?\nImproved reaction to execution errors\n\n?\nManoeuvres can be calibrated\n\n?\nDrift orbit not required Satellite on-station sooner\n\n?\nReduced propellant requirement\n\n?\nCommon fuel supply for primary and\n\nsecondary propulsion\nFuel savings provide increased life on-station\n\n?\n\nExtended transfer orbit phase Increased cost of ground station support \u00d7\nPower and thermal problems \u00d7\n\nMore complex propulsion system Cost \u00d7\nControl problems induced by \u2018fuel slosh\u2019 \u00d7\n\n\n\nGEOSTATIONARY EARTH ORBITS (GEO) 5.6 137\n\nSolar radiation perturbation is complex to model and depends critically upon both the\nratio of projected area to mass of the vehicle and its surface characteristics. Its predominant\ninfluence is upon the orbit eccentricity vector e. Generally, an effective area-to-mass ratio,\nwhich includes the reflectivity coefficient to solar illumination, is used. When this is less\nthan ?0.005 m2/kg, the effects of radiation pressure are significantly less than other pertur-\nbations. However, for larger values (>0.01 m2/kg) it can cause significant perturbations.\n\nThe generalized techniques for examining the influence of perturbations, which were\nnoted in Chapter 4, are not necessarily the optimum methods for analysis of GEO. This is\nparticularly so since the orbit is ideally circular, and hence ? is undefined; the inclination is\nalso ideally zero, resulting in \t being undefined. A method that is applicable is to linearize\nthe equations of motion for small perturbations of magnitude ?a in the semi-major axis\na . For small values of ?a , i and e, a linearized solution to Kepler\u2019s equation yields [13]\n\nr = A + ?a ?

The geocentric distance r (equation 5.27) oscillates sim-\nply about a mean distance (A + ?a) with an amplitude of Ae. Similarly, the latitudinal\nvariation, from equation (5.29), is a simple oscillation about the equatorial plane with an\namplitude equal to the orbital inclination. The longitude, however, manifests an oscilla-\ntion of amplitude 2e, but also a drift rate. It is worth noting that for circular orbits whose\nsemi-major axes are given by A and whose inclinations are non-zero, the ground track\nwill be a figure of eight of the form shown in Figure 5.20.\n\nEarth triaxiality perturbation is due to the dominant J22 Earth tesseral harmonic that\nproduces a force on the spacecraft whose direction is shown in Figure 5.18 [13]. From\nSection 5.2, it is evident that a positive ?V will expand an orbit, changing both the semi-\nmajor axis and the eccentricity. Since an expanded orbit relative to GEO has a longer\nperiod, a positive ?V (i.e. an eastward impulse) will lead to westward drift in satellite\nlongitude. Hence, referring to Figure 5.18, the longitude drift rates are opposed to the\nacting force direction, and it is apparent that 105.3?W and 75.1?E are stable equilibria\nagainst equatorial drift. The magnitude of the acceleration as a function of longitude is\nshown in Table 5.4.\n\nLuni-solar perturbations mainly cause out-of-plane forces acting on the spacecraft,\nleading to changes of inclination of the orbit. However, since a component of this force\nnecessarily lies in the equatorial plane, then a, e and hence ? are also influenced. This\nequatorial component is nearly cyclic with the Earth orbit period, with a magnitude less\nthan that caused by the J22 term. It therefore does not lead to a significant secular evolution\nof the orbit. More details may be found in Reference [13].\n\n\n\n138 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\n2e\n\nAe\n\nDistance\n\nLongitude Mean\nlongitude\n\nr ?

The net force\non the orbit plane evolution, shown in Figure 5.19, must clearly be opposed by an oppo-\nsite ?V . The magnitude of the ?V arising from the luni-solar perturbation is typically\n?50 m/s/year and thus the propulsion requirements for the control of orbit inclination\n(i.e. north/south station-keeping) is at least a factor of 20 larger than that required to\novercome triaxiality (i.e. east/west station-keeping) effects (see Table 5.4). This results\nin the need for particularly careful control and planning of manoeuvres in order to avoid\ndisadvantageous coupling between north/south and east/west control. This interaction is\ndiscussed in the following two sections.\n\nIn summary, the nature of station-keeping is to locate the spacecraft under the influence\nof the perturbations described within a specified range of longitude and latitude. This\nsituation is shown in Figure 5.20. Whilst the apparent position of the spacecraft projected\non the celestial sphere provides information to the ground control centre indicating whether\nthe spacecraft is within the correct longitude/latitude region, the range and range rate\nare also required so that the actual orbit may be determined. This nominal orbit may\nthen be used to schedule station-keeping manoeuvres to preclude departure from the\nrequired longitude/latitude location box.

(5.30)\n\nwhere t is the time since the impulsive burn. This is shown in Figure 5.21.\nLongitudinal control can be effected by using an impulsive along-track burn when the\n\nspacecraft reaches one extreme of the required error box. The subsequent longitude drift\ndue to J22 (see Figure 5.18) brings the spacecraft back to the same side of the box as\nshown in Figure 5.22, and the process is repeated as a limit cycle. This neglects the short\nperiod fluctuations caused by luni-solar perturbations.\n\nIf the ?V is sized so that the spacecraft just reaches the opposite side of the box\nfollowing a burn, and a constant acceleration f is assumed (as listed in Table 5.4), then\nthe ?V and the corresponding period T of the limit cycle are\n\n?V = 4\n?\n\nrf ?max\n3\n\nand T = 4\n?\n\nr?max\n3f\n\n(5.31)\n\nwhere r is the orbit radius (?42 \u00d7 106 m) and the \u00b1?max represents the box size.\nThus, for example, a satellite at a nominal longitude of ?160?(f = ?5.3 \u00d7 10?8 m/s2)\n\nrequiring an error box of ?max = 0.1? (remember to convert to radians) would require\n?V = 0.14 m/s and the period of the limit cycle would be T = 31 days.\n\nEast\n\nWest\n\n?1 0 1 2\nSidereal days\n\n? \nLo\n\nng\nitu\n\nde\n, r\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nsc\nal\n\ne\n\n?0\n?V\n\nFigure 5.21 Longitude evolution following an east burn\n\n\n\n142 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nEast burn East burn\n\nTime\n\nLo\nng\n\nitu\nde\n\n (\nE\n\nas\nt)\n\nFigure 5.22 Parabolic shape of mean longitude free drift with station-keeping by east\nburns. In this example, the satellite is stationed where the triaxiality drift is Easterly, and\nthe burns induce a Westerly drift\n\nThis technique could be referred to as the \u2018ping-pong method of East\u2013West station-\nkeeping\u2019, since a little thought shows that it is entirely analogous to repeatedly tapping a\nping-pong ball on a bat. The impact on the bat corresponds to the impulsive burns, the\nconstant gravitational acceleration represents the constant longitudinal acceleration within\nthe dead band, and the constant height amplitude of the ball\u2019s motion reflects the size of\nthe longitude dead band. This rather whimsical observation may aid understanding of this\nmethod of East\u2013West station-keeping, since the two situations are physically equivalent.\n\n5.6.4 Latitude station-keeping\n\nLatitude drift may usefully be approached by introducing the two-dimensional vectors i\nand e given by Reference [13]:\n\ne =\n[\n\nex\ney\n\n]\n=\n\n[\ne cos(\t + ?)\ne sin(\t + ?)\n\n]\n\ni =\n[\n\nix\niy\n\n]\n=\n\n[\ni sin \t\n\n?i cos \t\n]\n\nThe natural evolution of inclination during a five-year period is shown in Figure 5.23,\ncorresponding to a number of initial values of \t. This wavy drift shows the half-yearly\neffect caused by the motion of the Earth about the Sun. The lunar periodicity of 14 days\nis smoothed out in this representation.\n\nThe objective of latitudinal station-keeping is to maintain the trajectory of the inclination\nvector within a specified region of the ix , iy plane. In the case shown in Figure 5.23, for\nexample, the inclination is to be constrained within a circle of radius 2.5?, which represents\na maximum orbit plane inclination of 2.5?.\n\nThe philosophy of inclination control is similar to that of longitude, a correcting nodal\nburn taking place just before the inclination drifts to the maximum permitted by the error\nbox, \u00b1imax, say. If the spacecraft\u2019s speed is V , then the directional change needed is\n2imax, and this will require a ?V of 2Vimax (see equation 3.21).\n\nFor example, if imax = 0.1? and V = 3075 m/s, then ?V = 10.7 m/s.\nClearly, the ?V impulses for controlling inclination are appreciably greater than those\n\nneeded for longitude, and their errors due to cold starts will therefore represent a smaller\npercentage error.\n\n\n\nHIGHLY ELLIPTIC ORBITS 5.7 143\n\n2.5\u00b0\n\nCircle of i = 2.5\u00b0\n\n? = 120\u00b0\n\n? = 100\u00b0\n\n? = 80\u00b0\n\n? = 60\u00b0\n\nCentre of circle\nthrough starting\npoints\n\nDrift of i\n\nix\n\niy\n\nFigure 5.23 Uncontrolled evolution of inclination vector i in component form ix , iy\n\nTable 5.5 GEO burns direction\n\nNorth burn South burn\n\nSpring Morning Evening\nSummer Midnight Noon\nAutumn Evening Morning\nWinter Noon Midnight\n\nLatitude manoeuvres imply a change of the orbit plane. Such manoeuvres must be per-\nformed on the line of nodes, using north/south burns at times of day indicated by Table 5.5.\nIdeally, the thrust vector should be perpendicular to the plane bisecting the initial and\nrequired orbit planes (see equation 3.21), and should produce no change in the spacecraft\u2019s\nspeed. The thrust direction should be accurate since a directional error ? will lead to a\nspeed change of approximately 2Vimax?, and this would influence the longitude drift rate;\nerrors of only a few degrees could swamp the natural longitude drift rates noted above.\n\n5.7 HIGHLY ELLIPTIC ORBITS\n\n5.7.1 Space-borne observatories\n\nSpacecraft in elliptic orbits move more rapidly at perigee than at apogee (equation 4.21).\nThis offers the prospect of a pass of increased duration over a ground station if the apogee\nis situated above it.\n\n\n\n144 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nThis type of orbit has been used to good effect in the past for astronomical\nobservatories such as ISO and the X-ray Multi-mirror Mission (XMM Newton). These\ntypes of spacecraft are often used in observatory mode, which means the spacecraft\ninstruments are operated as if they were located in a room adjacent to the astronomer\u2019s\nworkstation. This requires that for extended periods of time the payload can be pointed\nto desired astrophysical targets whilst uninterrupted contact with a ground station is\nmaintained. By placing such a spacecraft into highly eccentric orbits with a low perigee\nand an apogee substantially higher than the GEO radius, the observatory will spend the\nmajority of its mission time in the apogee region. By optimizing its orbit period with\nrespect to the ground station coverage, operation in observatory mode can be achieved.\n\nGenerally, there will be an interruption of observational time while the spacecraft\npasses through the perigee region. This also corresponds, however, with a traverse of\nthe Van Allen radiation belt (see Chapter 2), which precludes the operation of certain\ntypes of payload, such as ? -ray, X-ray and UV detectors, which are particularly sensitive.\nObservation duty cycles in excess of 90% can be achieved in these orbits.\n\nThe alternative of placing this type of spacecraft into GEO has many obvious benefits\nsuch as ground station cover and long sensor integration times, but GEO is generally a\nhigher energy orbit than a highly elliptical one, requiring greater ?V to place it there.\nMoreover, the radiation environment in GEO may also preclude the operation of certain\ntypes of payload.\n\n5.7.2 Communications spacecraft\n\nIn order to maintain the apogee above a ground station for a maximum period, the Earth-\noblateness perturbation, which causes the line of apsides to precess can be used (Chapter 4,\nSection 4.4.1). From equation (4.39), the major axis of the orbit will rotate in the plane\nof the orbit by an amount, to first order, given by\n\n?? ? 3?J2R\n2\nE\n\np2\n\n(\n2 ? 5\n\n2\nsin2 i\n\n)\nrad/rev (5.32)\n\nThis will cause the apogee of the orbit to move away from above the region where the\nservice is required.\n\nHowever, there are two solutions of equation (5.32) for which ?? = 0, namely,\ni = 63.4? (prograde) and i = 116.6? (retrograde). At these inclinations, the line of\napsides does not rotate and the apogee is stabilized at its initial position. Using this\ncharacteristic, spacecraft in highly elliptic orbits inclined at 63.4? have been used to\nprovide communication links between high-latitude ground sites. Spacecraft in GEO\ncannot provide this service at latitudes in excess of 70?, North or South, since their\nelevation at ground sites is then less than 10?.\n\nMolniya spacecraft\n\nThe use of highly elliptic inclined orbits was adopted by the former Soviet Union in April\n1965 with the launch of the first Molniya (lightning) spacecraft.\n\n\n\nHIGHLY ELLIPTIC ORBITS 5.7 145\n\nFigure 5.24 The Molniya orbit\n\nThe Molniya orbit , shown in Figure 5.24, is a highly elliptic one with a 12-hour period\n(strictly half a sidereal day, 11 h 58 min), inclined at 63.4? to the equator. The initial\napogee, at a height of around 39 000 km, is placed above the Northern hemisphere, where\nit remains for the mission lifetime as a result of the choice of orbit inclination. Because\nthe eccentricity is high, typically about 0.7, the spacecraft moves relatively slowly in the\napogee region, and it consequently remains at high elevation over the high-latitude sites\nfor an extended period. Each such spacecraft may then be utilized for communications\npurposes for typically 8 h of its 12-h orbit period.\n\nTo provide 24-h regional services, at least three Molniya spacecraft are needed. One\nof these resides in each of the three planes whose ascending nodes are spaced 120?\napart. Many Molniya spacecraft have been launched; communications traffic in the CIS\nhas grown to warrant the operation of typically eight Molniya I and eight Molniya III\nspacecraft in eight orbit planes spaced at 45? intervals.\n\nA nominal set of Molniya orbital elements is given in Table 5.6. The ground track\nis shown in Figure 5.25(a). Since the spacecraft is at near-GEO altitude at apogee, its\nangular rate is approximately that of the Earth, and so the ground track over the required\nregion closely follows a meridian as shown in Figure 5.25(a).\n\nInterest in Molniya orbits is not confined to the CIS. Other space agencies are consid-\nering their use for high-latitude mobile communications and navigation programmes.\n\nTable 5.6 Molniya orbit elements\n\na = 26 560 km (12 h orbit period)\ne = 0.722 (hp = 1000 km, ha = 39 360 km)\ni = 63.4?\n? = 270?

The principal difference is that its period is one sidereal day\u201423 h\n56 min. An example of a global ground track for a Tundra orbit with an eccentricity of\n0.24 is shown in Figure 5.25(b). Its main advantages are that it can provide 24-h coverage\nwith a minimum of only two spacecraft, and that the orbital parameters can be chosen so\nthat the spacecraft does not traverse the Earth\u2019s radiation belts. Its main disadvantage is\nthat a higher ?V is needed for orbit acquisition.\n\nTable 5.7 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages for communications purposes\nof the inclined highly elliptic orbit compared with GEO.\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 147\n\nTable 5.7 Principal attributes of highly inclined communications orbits\n\nAdvantages Comments\n\u2022 Satellite at high elevation at high\n\nlatitude ground sites\n\u2022 No eclipse during communications\n\noperation\n\nThis is an overriding benefit for mobile\ncommunication services at high latitude\n\nDisadvantages Comments\n\n\u2022 Ground stations must track\nspacecraft\n\n\u2022 More than one satellite required for\n24-hour regional coverage\n\n\u2022 Satellite switching protocol required\n\u2022 Variation in satellite range and\n\nrange-rate\nThis has a number of impacts upon the\ncommunication payload design:\n\n\u2014 variation in time propagation\n\u2014 frequency variation due to Doppler\n\neffect\n\u2014 variation in received signal power\n\u2014 change of ground coverage pattern\n\nduring each orbit\n\n\u2022 Passage through Van Allen radiation\nbelts each orbit\n\nAccelerated degradation of power and\nelectronic systems\n\n\u2022 Orbit perturbations Third-body forces may perturb the\nperigee height, causing atmospheric re-\nentry\n\n5.8 INTERPLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n5.8.1 Introduction\n\nIt is apparent that in the analysis of interplanetary trajectories, due account must be\ntaken of perturbations caused by the gravitational influence of the Sun and planetary\nbodies within the solar system, and to a lesser extent to surface forces arising from solar\nradiation pressure.\n\nFor interplanetary spacecraft, the task of trajectory optimization and mission design\nis one of considerable complexity, requiring software support. Mission specialists at the\nNASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena have developed such computational tools\nto analyse complex missions such as that of the Jovian Galileo spacecraft, the Cassini\nmission to explore the Saturnian system, or the near-Earth asteroid rendezvous (NEAR)\nspacecraft to orbit a small body. Such a treatment is beyond the scope of this book.\nHowever, there is a simplified method, referred to as the patched conics method , which\nis widely used in feasibility studies of interplanetary flight.\n\nThe patched conics method assumes, in its simplest form, that at any one time only one\nbody, a central body, is acting on the spacecraft. The region in which a particular body\n\n\n\n148 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nis dominant is called its sphere of influence, and in this region the spacecraft is assumed\nto follow a Keplerian orbit. As it leaves one region, it enters the sphere of influence of\nanother body and its trajectory becomes a new conic with the new body at its focus. Thus,\nthe entire trajectory is formed by patching together the various conic sections. Examples\nare shown in Section 5.8.2.\n\nSpheres of influence are determined as in the following example of the Earth, which is\nsubject to a disturbing gravitational field caused by the Sun. That is to say, a spacecraft\nat a distance rs from the Earth, and subject to its dominant gravitational force, is also\nsubject to a weaker force from the Sun, from which its distance is rd (see Figure 4.14,\nChapter 4). Equation (4.45) gives the ratio of the accelerations caused by the Earth as the\ncentral body and the Sun as the disturbing one. When this ratio is equal to that which is\ngiven by reversing roles (i.e. the Sun is the central body and the Earth is the disturbing\none), then the spacecraft is, by definition, situated on the sphere of influence of the Earth.\nEquation (4.45) can be used again, for the reverse role.\n\nFor the Earth\u2013Sun, the acceleration ratios are equal when the Earth\u2013spacecraft\ndistance is\n\nrs = rd\n(\n\nm?\nm?\n\n)2/5\n(1 + 3 cos2 ?)?1/10 (5.33)\n\nwhere m? and m? are the masses of Earth and Sun, respectively.\nThis surface approximates to a sphere since (1 + 3 cos2 ?)?1/10 ? 1. Equation (5.33)\n\nthen leads to the radius RSI of the sphere of influence about any planetary body of mass\nmp with respect to a disturbing body of mass md being\n\nRSI ? rd\n(\n\nmp\nmd\n\n)2/5\n(5.34)\n\nwhere now rd is the distance of the disturbing body from the central planetary body.\nThis equation shows that the Earth\u2019s RSI is about 0.93 \u00d7 106 km, assuming the Sun\n\nto be the disturbing body. (This compares with the radius of the Moon\u2019s orbit of about\n0.38 \u00d7 106 km.) Reference [14] provides a more detailed analysis.\n\nTable 4.1 shows the radii of the spheres of influence of the planets relative to the Sun.\n\n5.8.2 Patched conic examples\n\nThe following three examples show how the initial planning of interplanetary missions\nmay be conducted using the patched conic technique. They focus on the estimation of\n?V . The techniques for calculating a first estimate of transfer times on various trajectories\ncan be found in Chapter 4, Section 4.2. Each phase of the total mission is assumed to\nhave just one central gravitational force leading, for that phase, to a trajectory, which is\na conic with the central body at its focus. During each separate phase, the position and\nvelocity of the spacecraft are relative to the phase\u2019s central body, and at the handover\nfrom one to another they have to be recalculated.\n\nExample 1: interplanetary transfer\n\nThe transfer of a spacecraft from an orbit around the Earth to an orbit around Jupiter is\nconsidered using a Hohmann minimum-energy transfer (see Section 5.2). The orbits of\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 149\n\nthe Earth and Jupiter round the Sun are taken to be circular and coplanar. Their radii and\nother relevant data are taken from Tables 2.5 and 4.1.\n\nThe sequence of events can be defined by the following mission phases:\n\n\u2022 Phase 1: Geocentric\u2014the boost from Earth orbit to a hyperbolic escape trajectory.\n\u2022 Phase 2: Heliocentric\u2014the cruise in transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter.\n\u2022 Phase 3: Jupiter centred\u2014the powered deceleration from hyperbolic approach tra-\n\njectory to Jupiter orbit.\n\nFirst step: heliocentric phase\n\nConsider the Hohmann transfer within the Sun\u2019s sphere of influence (Figure 5.2). In the\ncase of this interplanetary transfer, equation (5.1) gives the required Earth-relative speed\nof the spacecraft as it exits the Earth\u2019s sphere of influence, as\n\nV E? =\n?\n\n?S\n\nrE\n\n(?\n2rJ\n\nrE + rJ ? 1\n)\n\n= 8.792 km/s (5.35)\n\nParameter values corresponding to the Sun, Earth and Jupiter are denoted by sub- or\nsuperscripts S, E or J, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, the apoapsis equation (5.2) gives the speed of the spacecraft relative to Jupiter\nas it enters the Jovian sphere of influence as\n\nV J? =\n?\n\n?s\n\nrJ\n\n(\n1 ?\n\n?\n2rE\n\nrE + rJ\n\n)\n= 5.643 km/s (5.36)\n\nThe transfer time is estimated as half the orbital period of the transfer ellipse, 2.731 years\nin this case.\n\nSecond step: geocentric phase\n\nThis phase covers the spacecraft\u2019s departure from the Earth, while it is still within its\nsphere of influence. The geometry of the trajectory is shown in Figure 5.26(a). The\nspacecraft is initially assumed to reside in a circular orbit of height h = 300 km. An\nimpulsive velocity increment ?V1 is provided at point A, in order to inject the vehicle\ninto a hyperbolic escape trajectory having a speed V E? at a great distance from Earth, as\ngiven in equation (5.35).\n\nSince the transfer is to be of the Hohmann type, the hyperbola\u2019s asymptote must be\nin the same direction as the Earth\u2019s orbital velocity vector. The escape hyperbola is then\npatched to the Hohmann transfer ellipse at the edge of the Earth\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nThe required velocity increment ?V1 is calculated by noting that the spacecraft\u2019s speed\nbefore the manoeuvre at A, given by equation (4.22), is\n\nVcirc =\n?\n\n?E\n\nRE + h = 7.726 km/s\n\n\n\n150 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nVcirc\n\nVE\n\nV?\nE\n\n?\n\nEarth\n\nA\n\nB\n\n(a)\n\nV?\nJ\n\nC\n\nD\n\n?\n\nJupiter\n\nVJ\n\nVcirc\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.26 Geometry of planetocentric trajectories, showing: (a) departure from\nEarth, with rocket burn at A, and hyperbolic path to exit the sphere of influence at B;\n(b) arrival at Jupiter, entering its sphere of influence at C, hyperbolic path to D, and with\na circularizing burn at D\n\nAfter the manoeuvre, the speed is determined by noting that the hyperbolic path between\nA and B is at constant energy, and at B the potential energy is zero, so from equation (4.5):\n\n1\n\n2\nV 2A ?\n\n?E\n\nRE + h =\n1\n\n2\n(V E?)\n\n2\n\nfrom which VA = 14.024 km/s.

It is assumed that D is the point of closest approach to\nJupiter on the hyperbola.\n\nOn arrival at C, at the aphelion of the Hohmann ellipse, the spacecraft\u2019s heliocentric\nspeed will be less than that of Jupiter; consequently the direction of its arrival will be\nopposite to Jupiter\u2019s direction of travel round the Sun.\n\nThe required velocity increment ?V2 at D may be calculated by using equation (4.5)\nto determine the speed VD before the manoeuvre:\n\n1\n\n2\nV 2D ?\n\n?J\n\n6RJ\n= 1\n\n2\n(V J?)\n\n2\n\nwhich leads to VD = 24.934 km/s, and equation (4.22) to determine the circular speed\nVcirc afterwards (Vcirc = 17.173 km/s). Thus\n\n?V2 = VD ? Vcirc = 7.761 km/s\n\nFor this example, the eccentricity e is 1.1080 and ?? is 154.5?.\n\nElliptic capture option\n\nIt must be noted that ?V2 can be reduced by specifying an elliptic capture orbit. For\nexample, such an orbit with a perijove of 6RJ and an apojove of 20RJ will require a higher\npost-manoeuvre speed at D, that is, 21.301 km/s, and so ?V2 is reduced substantially,\nto 3.633 km/s.\n\nUsing a typical chemical propellant with a specific impulse of 300 seconds, the Tsi-\nolkovsky equation (6.5) shows that the circular capture orbit above requires about 90%\nof the mass of the spacecraft that arrives at Jupiter to be fuel. For the elliptical capture\ncase, this reduces to about 70%. The choice of capture orbit clearly has a major impact\nupon the spacecraft\u2019s mass budget and upon the mission\u2019s feasibility.\n\nExample 2: planetary swing-by manoeuvres\n\nA swing-by manoeuvre is a close pass of a planetary body by a spacecraft. Relative\nto the planet the trajectory is hyperbolic. If the geometry of the inbound and outbound\nasymptotes is constructed appropriately with respect to the orbital motion of the planet,\nthen the spacecraft may increase or decrease its heliocentric velocity without expenditure\nof fuel. This makes the incorporation of these manoeuvres into interplanetary mission\ndesign a very attractive and powerful tool.\n\nThe Voyager spacecraft missions, launched in 1977 to explore the outer solar system,\nwere of short enough duration to make the mission viable only through the use of this\ntechnique. Indeed, the Voyager 2 trajectory design included swing-bys of Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus and Neptune, spanning 12 years. This is to be compared with 30 years for a direct\nHohmann-type transfer.\n\nThe mission designs for the Galileo Jupiter probe and the Cassini Saturn explorer both\nincorporate numerous swing-by manoeuvres in the capture and exploration mission phases.\n\n\n\n152 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nV?\n+\n\nV?\n+\n\nV?\n?\n\nV?\n?\n\nd\n\nd\n\nVP\n\nVP\n\nV1\n\nV2\n\n?V\n\nS/C2\n\nS/C1\n\nPlanet Sun\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 5.27 Swing-by passage behind a planet, showing: (a) hyperbolic trajectory in\nplanet\u2019s sphere of influence and (b) relative velocity diagram (all vectors are coplanar)\n\nThe patched conic method can again be used, in combination with a relative\nvelocity vector diagram, to provide a simple means of analysing spacecraft swing-bys.\nFigure 5.27(a) shows the swing-by geometry when the spacecraft passes \u2018behind\u2019 the\nplanet (relative to the planet\u2019s forward motion), in a planet centred coordinate system.\nAs the spacecraft enters the sphere of influence, the velocity relative to the planet is\nV??. If the hyperbola is a constant energy trajectory, then equation (4.5) shows that its\noutgoing velocity V+? is of equal magnitude, but its direction is deflected through an\nangle ?. Relative to the Sun, the planet\u2019s velocity is Vp. These vectors can be transferred\nto a relative velocity diagram shown in Figure 5.27(b), where they appear as dashed-line\nvectors. Nodes S/C1 and S/C2 represent the spacecraft before and after the encounter.\nCompletion of the diagram as shown gives the Sun-relative velocities V1 and V2 before\nand after the swing-by. The change in the heliocentric velocity is ?V.\n\nIt is clear that V2 is greater than V1, and so the spacecraft\u2019s speed has been increased\nby this passage behind the planet. A similar construction for a passage in front of a planet,\nshown in Figure 5.28, shows that this produces a reduction in speed. In both cases, the\nchange in speed is of magnitude.\n\n?V = 2V? sin(?/2) (5.37)\n\nExample 3: Ulysses-type swing-by\n\nThe ESA/NASA probe Ulysses performed a swing-by of the planet Jupiter in February\n1992, the purpose being to change the direction of Ulysses, so as to place it into an orbit\nin a plane that is approximately normal to the ecliptic (see Section 5.1).\n\nAfter deployment from the Space Shuttle in October 1990, the spacecraft was acceler-\nated to a record 15.4 km/s by a stack of upper stages.

Noting that V+? = V??, this then yields V2 = 7.74 km/s, and ?3 = 31.6?.

A more exact solution would be given by using the equations of the restricted\nthree-body problem (Chapter 4, Section 4.5), but these do not have an analytic solution.\n\n5.8.3 Small object missions\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe majority of interplanetary missions during the twentieth century focussed on explo-\nration of the major planets. There is, however, currently a surge of interest in investigating\nthe properties of minor bodies in the solar system, mainly asteroids and comets, which\nhas led to the proposal of many new spacecraft missions. The principal driver for this\nactivity is the hypothesis that these small objects, particularly comets, hold the key to\nunderstanding the composition of the genesis solar nebula, and possibly to the origin of\nlife. The term \u2018small\u2019 in this context has a wide interpretation however, \u2018small objects\u2019\nranging from the satellites of the major planets (some of which are larger than the planets\nMercury and Pluto), to asteroidal chunks of rock perhaps a kilometre across. Missions to\nbodies of the former type are firmly on the agenda\u2014for example, Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa\nhas stirred interest, with the prospect of the discovery of life in a sub-ice ocean fuelled\nby tidal vulcanism. Objects such as Europa are relatively large, and near-spherical in\nshape, and methods discussed elsewhere in this chapter can be used to assess a mission\nprofile. For example, a spacecraft orbiting Europa in combination with Jupiter, can be\nthought of as part of a circular, restricted three-body problem (see Chapter 4, Section 4.5)\nto a good approximation. A principal concern of a mission designer in this case would\nbe the longevity of the mission orbit around the moon, when subjected to the powerful\nperturbing influence of the parent planet Jupiter.\n\nThe focus of the discussion in this section will be asteroids and cometary bodies ,\ncharacterized by an irregular shape, and an overall dimension of up to a few tens of\nkilometres. Missions to orbit, and to land on such objects pose some interesting challenges\nto the mission designer. The first such mission, launched in February 1996, was the NEAR\nShoemaker spacecraft, which was placed into orbit about the asteroid 433 Eros in February\n2000. Figure 5.30 is a NEAR image of Eros, showing it to be an irregularly shaped object\nwith a maximum dimension of around 35 km.\n\nNear-body environment\n\nThe environment around small objects (particularly comets) is of great scientific interest in\nitself, but we will focus on those environments that influence the mission and spacecraft\nsystem design. Looking at Figure 5.30, perhaps the most obvious of these is that the\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 155\n\nFigure 5.30 Image of asteroid 433 Eros, acquired by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft\nin 2000. (Reproduced by permission of NASA/JHUAPL)\n\ngravity field does not approximate to that of a sphere, and a method of simulating orbits\nin such a field is discussed below.\n\nIf 433 Eros is to be regarded as typical, the near-body environment of asteroids appears\nto be \u2018clean\u2019, with minimal dust or debris posing a hazard to spacecraft (although asteroids\nhave been observed to have natural satellites\u2014the Galileo probe found the first, christened\nDactyl, around the asteroid 243 Ida in 1993).\n\nCometary bodies are similarly thought to be irregularly shaped, but comprised mainly\nof ice and dust. As a consequence, they can have a very dynamic near-body environment,\nparticularly when closer than around 3 AU to the Sun, when their surface layers become\nwarm enough to trigger the sublimation of ices. A nucleus observed at close quarters is\nthat of Halley\u2019s comet, when the European Space Agency (ESA) probe Giotto passed\nwithin 596 km in 1986. The resulting images revealed a very active nucleus about 16 km\nby 8 km in size, with bright jets of gas and dust emanating from the sunlit \u2018hemisphere\u2019.\nEvidence suggests, however, that cometary bodies more typically have a dimension of\nroughly 1 or 2 km. When active, the nucleus is the source of all cometary phenomena,\n\n\n\n156 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nwhich comprise the visible coma (extending up to a million km in radius), the hydrogen\ncloud (spanning many millions of km) and of course, the tail. Comets may exhibit dust\ntails up to 10 million km in length, and plasma tails extending up to 10 times further. The\ninteraction between the solar environment and these cometary features is complex, and\nthe subject of much research, a review of which can be found in Reference [15]. In terms\nof mission and spacecraft design, the cometary environment poses greater challenges (and\nunknowns) than that of asteroids. For example, a near-comet dust and debris environment\nwill cause orbit and attitude perturbations, which must be accounted for in the design.\nThere is an inevitable conflict between the scientists and the engineers, the resolution of\nwhich is difficult. The former group would wish to encounter the environment fully, to\nmaximize the scientific return, while the latter group would wish to avoid it to minimize\nrisks to the spacecraft. The difficulty facing the designer, however, is that this environment\nis not known a priori , and therefore a range of environments need to be accommodated\nin the design.\n\nMotion around small, irregularly shaped bodies\n\nThe motion of a spacecraft around a rotating, irregularly shaped body will approximate\nto the Keplerian orbits discussed in Chapter 4 when the vehicle is at sufficient distance.\nHowever, for close orbits where the orbit radius is of the same order as the body\u2019s size, the\ntrajectory shape no longer approximates to a conic section, and the resulting equations of\nmotion are sufficiently complex to make the use of a computational solution mandatory.\n\nThe gravity field of the body can be modelled using a variety of methods. In terms of\nan operational scenario, the objective is to determine the gravitational field of the body\nby observing the close proximity motion of an orbiting spacecraft. On approach, payload\nimagery will provide quantitative information regarding the size, shape and rotational\nstate of the body. On the basis of the shape assessment, the gravitational potential can be\nexpressed as a series of spherical harmonics (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.1) or ellipsoidal\nharmonics. Subsequent precise tracking of the motion of the orbiter will allow the\ncoefficients in these series expansions to be evaluated, so determining the gravitational\npotential of the object. This fairly complex process provides a general characterization of\nthe body\u2019s gravity field, which takes into account its shape and any localized variations\nin body density. The small sample of evidence currently available suggests that body\nshapes can best be approximated by triaxial ellipsoids. For example, the asteroid 433\nEros can be approximated by an ellipsoid with semi-axes 17.9 km, 9.2 km and 7.9 km.\nFor such a body, Garmier and Barriot [16] have demonstrated that the performance of\nthe ellipsoidal harmonic expansion is superior to a spherical harmonic representation.\nTheir investigation of lander trajectories showed that an ellipsoidal expansion up to\ndegree 5 gave a landing position error of the order of 1 m, compared to 10 s of m for the\nspherical harmonic representation.\n\nThe above operational methodology concerns itself with determining the gravity field\nfrom the analysis of the orbiter\u2019s motion. Conversely, given the gravity field of the body,\nthe motion of the orbiter may be determined. An approximate method of determining\nthe orbiter motion, which is adequate for initial study work, is presented here. This is\nsometimes referred to as the \u2018mascon\u2019 method, and uses the approach of building the\nbody\u2019s shape utilizing a collection of spherical masses of uniform size and density. These\nspherical \u2018building blocks\u2019 can be placed at the vertices of a three-dimensional grid, so\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 157\n\nX \n\nY \n\nZ \n\nm \nSpacecraft \n\nr \n\nri\n\nRi\n\nIrregularly\nshaped body \n\n\u2018Building block\u2019 \n\nmi\n\nW\n\nFigure 5.31 Geometry of the spacecraft in orbit around the irregularly shaped body\n\nthat they touch without overlap. The shape of the model of the irregularly shaped body\ncan then be made arbitrarily close to the observed shape of an asteroid or comet, by\nallowing the size of these mass elements to decrease (within the bounds of computational\neffort). The overall mass and density of the body must be estimated bearing in mind that\n?48% of the model is vacant. The gravitational potential at the spacecraft can then be\nfound by summing the contribution from each element (or equivalently the gravitational\nforce contribution from each may be summed vectorially). The situation is shown in\nFigure 5.31. The irregularly shaped body is shown rotating with angular velocity ? about\nthe Z axis of an inertial co-ordinate frame (X , Y , Z ), the origin of which is at the centre-\nof-mass of the body. The axis of rotation corresponds to the principal axis of maximum\ninertia of the body. From equation (4.2), the gravitational force acting on a spacecraft of\nmass m exerted by the body, comprised of n mass elements each of mass mi , is\n\nF =\nn?\n\ni=1\n\n(\nGmmi\n\nr2i\n\n)\n(?ri/ri ) (5.38)\n\nNoting that\nri = r ? Ri = (x ? Xi )i + (y ? Yi )j + (z ? Zi )k\n\nthe equations of motion of the spacecraft may be written as\n\nx? = Ax + Bx , y? = Ay + By , z? = Az + Bz (5.39)\n\nwhere\n\nA = ?\nn?\n\ni=1\n\nGmi\nr3i\n\n, Bx =\nn?\n\ni=1\n\n(\nGmi\nr3i\n\n)\nXi , By =\n\nn?\ni=1\n\n(\nGmi\nr3i\n\n)\nYi , Bz =\n\nn?\ni=1\n\n(\nGmi\nr3i\n\n)\nZi\n\nThe equations (5.39) may be easily transformed to a set of six coupled first-order differ-\nential equations given by\n\nx? = u , y? = v , z? = w , u? = Ax + Bx , v? = Ay + By , w? = Az + Bz (5.40)\n\n\n\n158 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nwhich may be solved numerically, given appropriate initial values of the spacecraft\u2019s\nposition and velocity. To compute the values of the A and Bx ,y ,z functions, the position\nvector of the elemental masses mi needs to be known as a function of time. Using the\nTaylor series for a vector function, we may write\n\nRi(t + ?t) = Ri(t) + ?tR?i(t) + 12?t2R?i(t) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\nBy noting that the vector Ri is constant in the co-ordinate frame rotating at angular\nvelocity ? with the asteroid, it is easily shown that\n\nRi(t + ?t) = Ri(t) + ?t{? \u00d7 Ri(t)} + 12?t2{? \u00d7 (? \u00d7 Ri(t))} + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (5.41)\n\nIf using equation (5.41) to update Ri(t), it should be ensured that the combination of\nthe magnitudes of ?t , Ri and ? provide a convergent series. The above approximate\nmethod may be used to simulate close orbits around small irregular bodies. However, the\noverall accuracy of the method increases with the number of spherical building blocks\nused (so increasing computational effort), and perturbations due to density anomalies are\nnot modelled.\n\nMission impact upon orbiter and lander system design\n\nIn this section, we discuss briefly the interaction between mission design and system\ndesign for a small body orbiter/lander mission. The focus will be on a comet rendezvous\nmission, since the challenges posed are greater than that of an asteroid mission. Many\nof the features are common to both. Such a cometary mission, called Rosetta , has been\nimplemented by the European Space Agency. This was launched in March 2004, with a\nplanned rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in the early part of 2014\nwhen the comet is about 5 AU from the Sun. A landing will be attempted in November\n2014, and the spacecraft will continue to orbit the comet as it approaches the Sun to\na perihelion distance of about 1.2 AU, when it is anticipated there will be vigorous\nsolar-induced activity.\n\nTo plan such a mission, particularly the close orbit and landing phases, the design is\nvery much dependent upon the physical properties of the comet and its environment.\nSince these are generally unknown prior to the mission, a useful course of action is to\npropose \u2018engineering models\u2019 of the target comet, which encompass the range of properties\nexpected. This allows the designer to accommodate a range of possibilities in the design.\nTable 5.8 shows the characteristics of a small, typical and large comet, similar to those\nconsidered in the Rosetta mission design. It is assumed that the comet models are spherical\nduring this design phase, to simplify trajectory calculations.\n\nA first examination of the table shows that the operating environment for an orbiter/\nlander is an extremely \u2018low-energy\u2019 one. Spacecraft generally orbit at a comfortable\nwalking pace\u2014orbital speed, orbital period and escape velocity can be estimated as a\nfunction of orbital height from equations (4.22), (4.12) and (4.25), respectively. Landers\ntake a long time to descend to the surface. Care is required when making trajectory\nmanoeuvres not to exceed escape velocity. Landers need to be secured to the surface on\ntouchdown. As we will see, these characteristics have an impact on the design of orbiter,\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 159\n\nTable 5.8 \u2018Engineering models\u2019 of a small, typical and large comet.

To highlight some of these impacts, we consider the\ndeployment of a comet lander from an orbiting vehicle.\n\nThe first issue is release of the lander from the orbiter, which may be done by a mech-\nanism, possibly in combination with thrusters. The difference between slowing the lander\nfor descent and attaining escape velocity is only a matter of a few cm/s for small comets,\nso careful thought is needed to ensure the release mechanism is adequately calibrated. If\nthrusters are used to acquire the correct descent speed, then sizing these is also an issue\nfor the same reason. These manoeuvres require the lander to have knowledge and control\nof its attitude. Initially, a gyro platform may be established from orbiter data. However,\ngiven that the descent time is likely to be large (see below), this may need to be updated\nusing reference sensors (see Chapter 9). To minimize the mass of the lander, payload\nsensors may be utilized for this attitude-sensing task. The near-body environment of the\ncomet will impact directly on the choice of sensor\u2014an imaging device may not be able\nto discriminate between intended targets, such as a stellar image, and a particle of debris.\n\nThe time to descend to the surface and the surface impact speed is easily estimated if it\nis assumed that the lander release sequence arrests its orbital motion, so that it free-falls\nunder gravity along a radial path. The time is given by\n\nt = ?\n?\n\nr30\n2?\n\n(\n? ? ?\n\n2\n? 1\n\n2\nsin 2?\n\n)\n, ? = sin?1\n\n?\nr\n\nr0\n(5.42)\n\nwhere r0 is the initial distance from the comet\u2019s centre, and r is the radius of the comet.\nThe impact speed, estimated from the energy equation (4.5), is given by\n\nVimp =\n?\n\n2?\n\n(\n1\n\nr\n? 1\n\nr0\n\n)\n(5.43)\n\n\n\n160 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 5 10 15 20\nRelease altitude (km)\n\nD\nes\n\nce\nnt\n\n ti\nm\n\ne \nt (\n\nho\nur\n\ns)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n\nRelease altitude (km)\n\nS\nur\n\nfa\nce\n\n Im\npa\n\nct\n S\n\npe\ned\n\n (\nm\n\n/s\n)\n\nSmall \n\nTypical \n\nLarge \n\nLarge \n\nTypical \n\nSmall\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.32 (a) descent time t and (b) surface impact speed Vimp as a function of\nrelease altitude for the three sizes of comet specified in Table 5.8\n\nThis \u2018impact speed\u2019 is a useful parameter as it is an estimate of the ?v required near\nthe surface to halt the lander for a soft touchdown. Figure 5.32(a) and 5.32(b) display\nvalues of descent time t and Vimp as a function of release altitude, for the three comet\ntypes given in Table 5.8. The descent time for small comets is long, which raises issues\nconcerning the attitude stability of the lander during this phase, especially if there are\ndisturbance torques induced by a severe near-body environment. If this disturbance is to\nbe controlled by a thruster limit cycle, then the duration of the descent will govern the\namount of propellant used. The use of angular momentum bias may be considered, either\nin the form of a momentum wheel or by rotation of the lander itself, in order to reduce the\nsensitivity of the attitude to the disturbances. A sophisticated trade-off analysis is required,\ninvolving mass and complexity minimization, to establish the optimum solution. Given\nthese interactions between system and mission design, a constraint on the descent time\nmay be imposed (e.g. t < 3 h), which in turn will dictate the release altitude. Very low\nrelease altitudes may be dangerous with respect to the near-body environment.\n\nThe next major event in the sequence is the soft landing. The vehicle may be arrested a\nfew tens of metres above the surface, and may even be required to \u2018hover\u2019 under thruster\npower. The values of Vimp given in Figure 5.32(b) give a measure of the ?v that needs\nto be imparted by the \u2018main engine\u2019. The fuel mass required may be approximated by\n\nMfuel = M0{1 ? exp[?(?v + gt)/vex ]} (5.44)\n\nwhere M0 is the mass of the vehicle before the burn, g is the surface gravitational\nacceleration and vex is the effective exhaust velocity of the engine. The thruster sizing\nagain is critical. Very low thrust levels will give good control, with respect to avoiding\ninadvertently acquiring escape velocity. On the other hand, the gravity loss \u2018gt\u2019 term\nin equation (5.44), and therefore the propellant mass, is larger for this type of engine.\nPollution of the surface by the exhaust products may also be an issue from the point of\nview of the science objectives. The final phase is touchdown, and in particular, some form\nof hold-down manoeuvre, which may use an \u2018upward\u2019 firing thruster while the vehicle\nattaches itself mechanically to the surface.\n\nThis brief description of a typical lander mission highlights some of the system issues\nthat pose a challenge to the design engineer.\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 161\n\n5.8.4 Missions using low-thrust trajectories\n\nIn Section 5.8.2, the patched conic method was introduced to provide approximate esti-\nmates of important mission parameters, such as ?V and transfer time. In doing so, an\nassumption was made that the engine firings were carried out using a high thrust chemi-\ncal propulsion system, so that the manoeuvres were effectively impulsive. In this section,\nthe consequences of abandoning this assumption are investigated by considering the effect\non the trajectory of a continuous low-thrust. This is characteristic of an electric propulsion\nsystem, such as an ion thruster as discussed in Chapter 6. Low accelerations in the order\nof 10?4 ? 10?5 m/s2 may currently be anticipated, for Earth-orbiting or interplanetary\nspacecraft propelled by this type of system. Although this seems insignificant, neverthe-\nless the electric propulsion system can operate for very long periods, so that ?V values\ncan be accumulated which are much larger than typical chemical systems can achieve.\nAlso, this level of propulsive acceleration will influence the trajectory so that it is no\nlonger Keplerian.\n\nSuch low-thrust propulsion systems are becoming more commonly used for orbit control\nactivities in GEO, drag compensation in LEO (e.g. GOCE), lunar orbit missions (e.g.\nSMART-1) and missions to comets and asteroids (e.g. Deep Space 1). The European\nSpace Agency BepiColombo programme is proposing to launch a mission in 2013 to\norbit the planet Mercury. This will involve the use of a complex mission profile utilizing\nion propulsion in combination with multiple gravity-assist manoeuvres. The spacecraft\nconfiguration is shown in Figure 5.33.\n\nFigure 5.33 The current configuration of the ESA BepiColombo spacecraft, showing\nthe ion propulsion system.

Carreau)\n\n\n\n162 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nLow-thrust trajectories in a central force field\n\nIn Section 4.2 we looked at the restricted two-body problem, and derived equation (4.4)\ndescribing the unperturbed motion of a spacecraft around a central body possessing an\ninverse square law gravity field. When the motion of the spacecraft is additionally influ-\nenced by a continuous low-thrust, this equation is modified to give\n\nr? + GM\nr2\n\nr\nr\n\n= a, a = P u?\nm\n\n(5.45)\n\nwhere a is the perturbing thrust acceleration. Here M and m are the masses of the central\nbody and the spacecraft respectively, P is the thrust magnitude, and u? is a dimensionless\nunit vector defining the direction of the thrust. The main rationale behind the analysis\nof low-thrust trajectories is to determine a steering law for the thrust vector, so that a\nparticular objective can be achieved. For example, this may be the evaluation of a time\nprofile for the thrust magnitude P and for the direction of the thrust vector u?, so that a\nspecified orbit transfer is achieved with minimum propellant, or minimum transfer time.\n\nLagrange\u2019s planetary equations\n\nSome useful aspects of the steering law problem can be illustrated by examining the rates\nof change of the osculating elements using Lagrange\u2019s planetary equations. Following\nthe method in Section 4.4, we can use the Gaussian form of these equations (4.34). By\nmultiplying through by appropriate factors of d?/dt ? h/r2, we can express the time rates\nof change of the elements as\n\nda\n\ndt\n= 2a2h\n\n(\ne sin ?S + pr T\n\n)\nde\n\ndt\n= 1h {p sin ?S + [(p + r) cos ? + re]T }\n\ndi\n\ndt\n= rh cos(? + ?)

Note that there are singularities (as in many other forms of these\n\nequations) in this formulation when e and i are zero. In this case, equations (5.46) may\nbe expressed in terms of equinoctial elements\u2014see for example Reference [17].\n\nThe thrust vector direction u? may be defined in terms of an azimuth angle ?2 and\nan elevation angle ?2, as shown in Figure 5.34.

In this discussion we consider the Earth as the central body, but\nclearly the techniques can be applied with respect to any such body\u2014e.g. interplanetary\ntrajectories about the Sun.\n\n\u2022 Secular rates of the orbit elements.\nFor fixed values of the steering angles ?2 and ?2, the secular change in the orbit\nelements can be estimated by integrating the osculating element rates over an orbit\n\n\n\n164 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nperiod, and dividing by the orbit period. For example, for the semi-major axis a\nwe find\n\nda\n\nd?\n= da\n\ndt\n\ndt\n\nd?\n? da\n\ndt\n\nr2\n\nh\n= 2a\n\n3\n\n?\n(1 ? e2)\n\n\u00d7 P\nm\n\ncos ?2\n\n{\ne sin ?2\n\nsin ?\n\n(1 + e cos ?)2 +\ncos ?2\n\n1 + e cos ?\n}\n\n.\n\nso that the change in a over one orbit period is given by\n\n?a =\n2??\n\n0\n\nda\n\nd?\nd? = 4?a\n\n3\n\n?\n\n?\n1 ? e2 P\n\nm\ncos ?2 cos ?2\n\nThis gives the secular rate of change of a as\n\n?\nda\n\ndt\n\n?\n= ?a\n\n?\n= 2\n\n?\na3\n\n?\n\n?\n1 ? e2 P\n\nm\ncos ?2 cos ?2. (5.49)\n\nA similar analysis may be performed for the other orbital elements.\n\u2022 Maximum rate of change of orbital energy.\n\nA steering law to maximize the change in orbital energy is useful when considering\nlow-thrust orbit transfer manoeuvres, or planetary escape and capture strategies. In-\nplane accelerations are most effective in changing the orbital energy, so that we set\nthe thrust elevation angle ?2 = 0. From equation (4.11) the orbital energy is given by\n? = ??/(2a), so that d?/dt = (?/2a2)(da/dt). From this we see that the maximum\nrate of change of energy occurs when the rate of change of a is maximized. To\nfind the maximum or minimum value, we can substitute the expression for da / dt\n\nfrom equations (5.48) into the standard condition\n?\n\n??2\n\n(\nda\n\ndt\n\n)\n= 0, which gives the\n\nfollowing expression for the optimum value of ?2,\n\ntan ?2 = e sin ?\n1 + e cos ? . (5.50)\n\nThe spacecraft\u2019s flight path angle ? has the same functional dependence, so that\nwe may conclude that the rate of change of orbital energy is maximized or minimized\nif ?2 = ? . That is, the thrust vector is aligned with the velocity vector, as indeed is\nthe intuitive solution which underlies the impulsive transfers considered previously.\n\n\u2022 Maximum rate of change of orbital inclination.\nThis can be found from the condition,\n\n?\n\n??2\n\n(\ndi\n\ndt\n\n)\n= r\n\nh\n\nP\n\nm\ncos(? + ?) cos ?2 = 0\n\nindicating a thrust vector elevation angle of ?2 = \u00b190?, with a direction that switches\nat the orbit apexes ? + ? = \u00b190?. This gives a maximum |di/dt | at the orbit nodes\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 165\n\n? + ? = 0? and 180?. A variable thrust magnitude P introduces an additional com-\nplication, as the out-of-plane acceleration is most effective in changing the orbital\ninclination when the spacecraft is at a greater distance from the central body, and\ntherefore moving relatively slowly. This is particularly important in eccentric orbits,\nas illustrated in Figure 5.35, when the thrust magnitude can be reduced at the peri-\napsis, and increased near the apoapsis.\n\nFigure 5.35 A typical plane changing strategy, showing direction and magnitude of\nthrust with orbital position for an eccentric orbit. (This figure is taken from\nNASA/TM-2002-211871 [18] and is used with permission of NASA)\n\nInterplanetary missions using low-thrust\n\nAs discussed in Section 5.8.1, interplanetary missions are usually partitioned into three\nphases: Earth escape, heliocentric transfer and planetary capture.\n\nLow-thrust Earth escape. The application of continuous low-thrust, applied along\nthe spacecraft\u2019s velocity vector, will give the maximum rate of increase of orbital\nenergy as discussed above. The resulting trajectory can be determined by numeri-\ncally integrating the equations of motion (5.45), noting that the mass of the spacecraft\ndecreases at each time step ?t ,\n\nmt+?t = mt + ?m , where ?m = ? P\ng0Isp\n\n?t . (5.51)\n\nThis solution, the classic spiral trajectory, is constrained by an initial boundary con-\ndition, for example departure from a circular orbit at a particular height, and by an\nescape condition usually characterized by a parabolic state (zero orbital energy, with\nan eccentricity of unity). The main mission parameters of interest are the resulting\n?V and time to escape, and these are shown in Figure 5.36 from Kemble [19] as\na function of the altitude of the initial orbit, which is assumed circular. The ?V\nplot shows that there is significant penalty in the use of low-thrust systems\u2014for\nexample, the ?V for escape from a 200 km altitude circular orbit is in excess of\n7 km/s, compared to 3.2 km/s for an impulsive manoeuvre. This results from the\ngravity loss term in the general Tsiolkovsky equation (see equation 7.6), as the flight\npath angle ? becomes significant for long periods of time as the spiral opens out\nnear the escape condition. Also the time to escape is generally long, for example of\nthe order of 2.5 years for a typical thrust acceleration of 10?4 m/s2.\n\n\n\n166 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\n0\n0\n\n600\n\n1200\n\n1800\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n10 000 20 000\n\nAltitude (km)\n\nT\nim\n\ne \n(d\n\nay\ns)\n\n?V\n (\n\nkm\n/s\n\n)\n\n30 000 40 000\n\n5 \u00d7 10?5\n\n10?4\n\n2 \u00d7 10?4\n\nFigure 5.36 Escape ?V and time from an initial circular orbit altitude. Constant\nacceleration, given in m/s2, is assumed in making the estimates of escape time. (From\nKemble (2006), with kind permission of Springer Science + Business Media)\n\nA low-thrust Earth escape manoeuvre from an initially elliptical orbit is more\nefficient in increasing orbital energy if the thrust is applied only over an arc centred on\nperigee, although the time to escape is then increased. In the case of a spacecraft with\na thrust acceleration of 10?4 m/s2 departing from an initial GTO (see Section 5.6.1),\nthe change in semi-major axis is ?30 km for each m/s of ?V applied near perigee,\ncompared to ?5 km change for each m/s in the apogee region [19].\n\nLow-thrust planetary capture. To achieve capture around the destination planet, the\nreverse procedure to the escape strategy may be implemented. In this case the initial\ncondition is a planet-relative (zero energy) parabolic approach state, followed by a\nlow-thrust spiral arc to the final state of a specified orbit. Achieving the final arrival\norbit in this process poses some difficulty, without the use of formal optimization\nmethods, but this can be alleviated by a numerical integration of a time-reversed\ntrajectory starting from the final orbit, remembering that the spacecraft mass must be\nincreased at each time step [17]. Having acquired the planet-relative escape condition,\nfurther propagation of the trajectory is required in order to match the Sun-relative\nstate of the spacecraft at the end of its heliocentric transfer. However this pragmatic\napproach is not without its difficulties\u2014an iterative process is required to estimate\nthe final spacecraft mass in orbit around the target planet (which is of course the\ninitial mass in the time-reversed propagation).\n\nOverall, the use of low-thrust propulsion for the escape and capture manoeuvres\nadds significantly to the total mission transfer time. In addition, the overall dose from\nthe Earth\u2019s trapped radiation belts (and any contribution from the target planet) is\nappreciably increased. Both of these factors adversely impact spacecraft reliability.\nFor missions where transfer time is already an issue, the escape phase can most\nsensibly be performed using high-thrust chemical propulsion of the launcher\u2019s upper\nstage for Earth departure. The implementation of a high-thrust chemical system\nonboard the spacecraft for the capture phase would be similarly beneficial, leaving\nthe spacecraft\u2019s low-thrust system to perform the Sun-centred transfer phase.\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 167\n\nSun-centred transfer . If we adopt the above strategy of using high thrust chemical\npropulsion for the escape and capture manoeuvres, then the low-thrust system can be\nused in the heliocentric transfer phase. During this phase of the mission, in general\nthe objective is to determine the time evolution of the control parameters, in this\ncase the thrust magnitude and direction, in order to find a trajectory between initial\nand final boundary conditions which, for example, maximizes the spacecraft mass\non arrival at the destination planet. This requires the use of trajectory optimization\ntechniques, the description of which is beyond the scope of this text. For more\ninformation the reader is referred to the review by Betts [20] and the treatments of\nKemble [19] and Chobotov [21].\n\nHowever, there are some analytical techniques which can be used as a first approx-\nimation. The first of these, attributed to Kemble [19], provides a first estimate of the\nfuel mass for such an orbit transfer. In this formulation, it is assumed that the space-\ncraft is equipped with both chemical and electric propulsion systems. The vehicle,\nwith initial mass M0, departs from the perigee of an elliptic orbit using an impul-\nsive burn from the chemical propulsion system which gives it an escape delta-V of\n?V1. The perigee and apogee radii are rp1 and ra1, respectively, and the resulting\nescape excess velocity is given by V?,E . Similarly the capture manoeuvre ?V2 at\nthe destination planet is also performed using the chemical propulsion system, with\nthe spacecraft entering an elliptical orbit with periapsis and apoapsis radii of rp2 and\nra2 from an approach excess velocity of V?,C . As a first approximation, Kemble\nthen assumes that the delta-V performed by the electric propulsion system during\nthe heliocentric transfer ?VT is given by\n\n?VT = (V?1 ? V?,E ) + (V?2 ? V?,C ), (5.52)\n\nwhere V?1 is the excess velocity required to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit after\nthe escape manoeuvre. Similarly, V?2 is the excess velocity that would be required\nat the destination planet if the vehicle approached on the Hohmann trajectory. The\ntotal mass ratio for the mission, given by\n\nMfinal\nM0\n\n= exp\n( ??V1\n\ng0Isp,Ch\n\n)\nexp\n\n(??VT\ng0Isp,El\n\n)\nexp\n\n( ??V2\ng0Isp,Ch\n\n)\n(5.53)\n\nis then minimized analytically with respect to V?,E and V?,C to obtain the following\nestimates\n\nV 2?,E =\n2?1I 2sp,Ch\n\nrp1(I 2sp,El ? I 2sp,Ch)\n, V 2?,C =\n\n2?2I 2sp,Ch\nrp2(I 2sp,El ? I 2sp,Ch)\n\n,\n\nwhere ?1 and ?2 are the gravitational constants of the Earth and the destination\nplanet respectively. Here Isp,Ch is the specific impulse of the chemical propulsion\nsystem, and Isp,El is that of the electrically propelled system. The values of ?V1 and\n?V2 can be estimated from\n\n?V1 =\n?(\n\n2?1\nrp1\n\n+ V 2?,E\n)\n\n?\n?\n\n2?1\nrp1\n\n(\nra1\n\nrp1 + ra1\n\n)\n,\n\n\n\n168 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\n?V2 =\n?(\n\n2?2\nrp2\n\n+ V 2?,C\n)\n\n?\n?\n\n2?2\nrp2\n\n(\nra2\n\nrp2 + ra2\n\n)\n,\n\nand the value of ?VT obtained from (5.52), so that the total mass ratio (and hence\nfuel mass) can be acquired from (5.53).\n\nPioneering work on low-thrust trajectories was also done by Edelbaum [22] in\nthe early 1960s, who developed a simplified approach to the problem of the transfer\nbetween two non-coplanar, circular orbits. With the assumption of constant acceler-\nation, this yields the analytic solution for the required ?V , given by\n\n?V =\n(\n\nV 20 + V 2 ? 2VV0 cos\n(?\n\n2\n?\n))1/2\n\n,\n\nwhere V0 and V are the initial and final circular velocities of the orbits and ?\nis the angle between the two orbit planes. An alternative treatment of Edelbaum\u2019s\nmethodology can be found in [21].\n\n5.8.5 Planetary atmospheric entry and aeromanoeuvring\n\nOur exploration of the solar system has revealed that not only do several of the major\nplanets have atmospheres, but also some minor bodies, such as Titan, possess a significant\ndetectable atmosphere. Probes sent to explore such worlds by orbiting or landing on these\nbodies require the ability to actively or passively manoeuvre successfully in such an envi-\nronment. Indeed, the opportunity is provided by planets having an atmosphere to reduce\nthe total vehicle wet-mass in the execution of a particular mission. Table 2.6 provides data\non the atmospheres of those bodies in the Solar System having a significant atmosphere.\n\nIt is evident from the discussion in Chapter 4, Section 4.4, that the principal effect of\nan atmosphere on a satellite\u2019s trajectory is to reduce the energy of the orbit. However, it is\nalso possible to utilize the aerodynamic forces, in order to produce both along-track and\nacross-track accelerations without the need for propulsive manoeuvres. The along-track\neffects, which are generally associated with aerobraking , are used and proposed for a\nvariety of mission operations to reduce the translational energy of a spacecraft. These\ninclude direct atmospheric entry to reduce the vehicle\u2019s speed to facilitate soft landing,\norbital aerocapture where aeroforces are used to transfer a vehicle\u2019s orbital state from\nhyperbolic to elliptical, and aero-assisted orbit transfer where an atmospheric pass is used\nto modify the orbit. An example of the latter is the transfer of a vehicle from high orbit\nto low orbit, where an aerobraking manoeuvre is performed in the periapsis region. The\nacross-track aeroforces produce out-of-plane accelerations, and so can be used to modify\nthe orbit plane inclination. It has also been proposed to use them to augment the beneficial\neffects of gravitational swing-bys (see Section 5.8.2). Aeromanoeuvring is a term applied\ngenerally to missions utilizing aerodynamic forces. Clearly, savings in propellant mass\ncan be achieved, but this must be weighed in all instances against the additional mass\nrequired to protect the vehicle from the dynamic pressure and thermal effects associated\nwith aeromanoeuvring.\n\nA survey of aeroassisted orbit transfer is provided by Walberg [23]. He looked at three\nspecific mission categories, that is, synergetic plane change, planetary mission applica-\ntions and orbit transfer applications. All these include some degree of aeromanoeuvring\n\n\n\nINTERPLANETARY MISSIONS 5.8 169\n\nwhich, unlike the simple swing-by missions discussed in Section 5.8.2, have a mass\npenalty as mentioned above. This arises from the need to incorporate in the design an\naeroshield and, in some cases, propellant mass if there is a propelled trajectory between\nintermediate orbits.\n\nSince Walberg\u2019s paper, there have been a number of planetary missions launched which\nhave incorporated a degree of aeromanoeuvring. A review of the mission designs and in-\nflight performance of several missions: Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Pathfinder, Galileo,\nMars Microprobe, Mars Polar Lander and Stardust , may be found in a special jour-\nnal issue [24]. More recently a review of optimization of trajectories using aeroassist\nspecifically for orbit transfer vehicles has been provided by Be?rend [25]. The engineer-\ning solutions, incorporating the aeroassisted element of the mission design, were in part\nspurred by the Goldin initiative for NASA of providing faster, better, cheaper missions.\nThis is as a result of aeroassist being a method of both reducing mass of a planetary\nsatellite directly and providing a consequential cost reduction of launch vehicle services.\nAccording to Reference [24], 65% of NASA\u2019s planetary missions scheduled for the period\n1995 to 2005, utilized aeroassist. The following section provides a simplified overview\nof the key features of the aerodynamic influences of this type of space mission.\n\nThe resurgence of interest in manned missions to Mars during the first decade of the\ntwenty-first century has led to further studies on the use of aerocapture for large vehicles\n(tens of metric tons) entering the Martian atmosphere. These studies show that some\nsignificant mass savings are feasible. However the technology requirements are not met\nby current capabilities. The mass of the aeroshell for such a vehicle is substantial and\ncan amount to ?15% of the vehicle entry mass. Reference [26] provides a recent review\nof aerocapture for manned missions to Mars, including the issue of precision landing by\nsuch methods.\n\nAtmospheric entry\n\nAs a space vehicle approaches a planet having an atmosphere, it experiences an approxi-\nmate exponentially increasing atmospheric density. This provides a changing aerodynamic\nenvironment for the vehicle. Initially the Mach number (the ratio of the vehicle\u2019s speed\nrelative to the local speed of sound in the gas) M0 may be in the range of 20 to 50.\nThe initial density is so low, however, that the flow field is described as a free molecular\nflow . In this regime, the molecules and atoms that constitute the atmosphere collide so\ninfrequently, that following impact upon a vehicle surface, the molecule will not then\ncollide with the incoming molecules. Under such conditions, shock waves are not formed\nabout the body. However, as the vehicle progresses further into the atmosphere, a tran-\nsition flow commences. This region is difficult to describe analytically, and frequently\nbridging functions are used to describe the aerodynamic properties of the vehicle. Thick\nviscous shock waves are formed about the vehicle at this time. Eventually, if the vehicle\npenetrates sufficiently low into the atmosphere, a continuum flow region is encountered,\nwhich is that type of flow typified by conventional aerodynamics. The velocity, however,\nis still so great that the flow remains hypersonic.\n\nKey to an understanding of the flow field and the changes that occur within it is\nthe recognition of the amount of energy required to be dissipated. Taking the amount of\nenergy per unit mass to be ?0.5 V 2, if a vehicle is approaching the planet on a hyperbolic\ntrajectory with a velocity of tens of km/s, hundreds of MJ must be dissipated. An extreme\n\n\n\n170 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nexample is the entry of the Galileo probe into the Jovian atmosphere in 1995. With an\napproach speed of 47.5 km/s, 3.8 \u00d7 105 MJ of translational energy were dissipated in the\nfour minutes before the drogue parachute was deployed. This generated a temperature of\n15 000 K, and an estimated 90 kg of ablative material was lost from the probes forward\nheat shield (out of a total probe initial mass of 340 kg). At such energies, the gas that\nis incident upon the vehicle undergoes not only chemical reactions, but also excitation\nof internal energy modes such as vibration, together with dissociation and ionization.\nRelaxation from these excited states may arise through radiation. The time constants of\nthese processes are large, and hence the flow field is not in equilibrium. As a result, there\nis great difficulty in analytically predicting the changes that arise in the gas, as the normal\nrelationships of equilibrium thermodynamics cannot be applied. Approximations, such as\nassuming that the constituents (both in terms of their chemical composition and the degree\nto which excitation has occurred) have relative number density fractions frozen at some\npoint in the flow, may be used to simplify the analysis. Detailed predictions are made\nyet more complex by the uncertain role the vehicle surface plays in the chemistry of the\nreacting flow. The overall net effect however, of the high velocity flow field impinging\non a surface is to cause substantial heat transfer to the vehicle. It is also clear from this\nbrief introduction that, because of the chemically reacting flow conditions, the actual heat\nloads a vehicle will experience will depend upon the constituents of the atmosphere itself.\nThe dominant constituents for each of the planetary atmospheres is shown in Table 2.6.\nAn excellent recent review of the literature concerning planetary entry gas dynamics is\ngiven by Gallais [27].\n\nConstraints during atmospheric entry\n\nThe two principal constraints that occur in the design of an aeromanoeuvring vehicle\nare the peak dynamic load and the peak thermal load, together with how long these\nloads persist.\n\nDuring entry, it is possible to write down the overall governing equations that describe\nthe dynamics. For a ballistic entry, it is assumed that the aerodynamic forces only provide\na drag force parallel to the instantaneous direction of motion, with no cross track force\n(equivalent to a zero lift coefficient CL). It is possible to write down the relationship\nbetween the distance to the centre of the planet r at time t , if at that time the flight path\nangle of the vehicle is ? and the velocity V .

These\ntypically omit elements of the various heat transfer processes that take place in the real\nflow. For example, if only convective heat transfer is considered (or is indeed dominant)\n[28], then the peak heating rate is given by\n\nq?max ? V 30\n?(\n\nm? sin ?0\n3SCD\n\n)\n(5.58)\n\nIn general, this peak heat flux will occur at a different altitude from that for the peak\ndeceleration load.\n\nEvidently, both the dynamics and heat loads are dependent upon the initial conditions\nassumed for atmospheric entry [27]. As a result, calculations that are performed must\nassume an overall mission profile. Thus, the preceding interplanetary manoeuvres will\ninfluence the final loads experienced by a vehicle, together with the launch date. For the\nMars Pathfinder mission [29], the inertial arrival velocity could vary by 100 m/s. The\nworst case (highest entry velocity) trajectory is shown in Figure 5.38.\n\nVarious design solutions have been used, or proposed to accommodate both the dynamic\nloads and thermal heat flux.

Figure 5.39 shows the range of heat loads experienced for different vehicles. It\nshould be noted that for some vehicles, such as Apollo, ablative shields are appropriate,\nsince contamination is not an issue. However, where sensitive scientific measurements\nare to be taken shortly after the main phase of deceleration, the role and final fate of any\nablative shield and its constituent materials, needs to be carefully examined.\n\nEntry corridor\n\nThe foregoing has identified the major constraints arising from the mission profile, which\nwill dictate the preferred engineering solution. There is one other major component to\nthe final mission design that derives from the planet to be encountered. Both maximum\nheat and dynamic loads are a function of entry angle ?0 as seen in equations (5.57) and\n(5.58) above. A design solution will specify the peak value that these loads may have.\nIf the vehicle were to enter at an angle greater than the specified value, then it may be\nanticipated that the vehicle will either burn-up or break-up. However, there also needs to\nbe consideration of the problem that will arise if the entry angle is shallower than that\nin the design solution. Chapman [30] defined an entry corridor in terms of the altitude\nof the first periapsis pass, following atmospheric entry. Undershooting the target height\n\n\n\n174 MISSION ANALYSIS\n\nTable 5.9 Entry corridor widths for entry into planetary atmospheres at parabolic\nspeed V0 = (2gr0)1/2\n\nPlanet Corridor width (km)\n\n5 g limit 10 g limit\n\nL/D = 0 L/D = 1 L/D = 1 L/D = 0 L/D = 1 L/D = 1\nmodulated modulated\n\nVenus 0 43 58 13 84 113\nEarth 0 43 55 11 82 105\nMars 338 482 595 644 885 1159\nJupiter 0 55 68 0 84 113\n\nleads to burn-up or break-up, whereas overshooting leads to the vehicle re-emerging from\nthe atmosphere. The entry corridor is then defined as the height difference of periapsis\nbetween the acceptable extremes of under- and overshooting. Clearly, this corridor is\ndependent upon the acceptable limits on both heat load and mechanical deceleration for\na specific vehicle.\n\nTable 5.9 provides data for corridor width for several planets.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThanks is due to Dr Hugh Lewis, for his assistance in compiling material for this chapter.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Klinkrad, H., Beltrami, P., Hauptmann, S., Martin, C., Sdunnus, H., Stokes, H., Walker, R.\nand Wilkinson, J.

Of the several alternatives identified, exploitation\nin terms of practical devices has concentrated largely on thermal and electric rockets.\nPrimary propulsion for launch vehicles is further restricted\u2014currently to solid- or liquid-\npropelled chemical rockets. The principal options are reviewed in detail in later sections\nand we refer only briefly to more speculative concepts.\n\nThe solar radiation pressure at 1 AU from the Sun is roughly 5 \u00d7 10?6 N m?2 and\ntherefore the surface area that must be deployed in order to produce significant thrust for\nprimary solar sailing is extremely large, even in circumstances where the gravitational\nforce on the sail is small. Whilst missions have long been identified for which solar sailing\nis an attractive option\u2014for example, the Halley\u2019s comet interception mission proposed\nin the mid-1970s (see Friedman et al. [1])\u2014there has been little practical demonstra-\ntion. Space vehicles of more modest dimensions may, however, be subject to significant\nperturbing torques, resulting, for example, from asymmetric surface deployments or sim-\nply from the cyclic variation of solar radiation pressure experienced by Earth-oriented\nspacecraft (see Chapter 9).\n\nNuclear propulsion has been the subject of very detailed studies over many years\n(see Gunn [2]), although these have not been pursued to significant flight demonstration.\nThe NERVA programme of the 1960s (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications)\nresulted in a ground-tested solid core (graphite) U235 fission powered engine deliver-\ning approximately 300 kN of thrust with a specific impulse of 825 s. With large-scale\ninterplanetary missions still a fairly distant prospect and the commercial emphasis on\nnear-Earth operations, direct thrust nuclear rockets do not appear to be cost effective\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

More recent studies have\nfocused on lower thrust orbit raising and manoeuvring propulsion as aspects of wider\nprogrammes for nuclear space power raising (see Buden and Sullivan [3]).\n\nThe development of high power lasers and intermittent interest in the establishment\nof complex orbiting platforms for power raising and communications in space have\nalso encouraged a number of conceptual studies of laser sustained propulsion (see\nCaveney, [4]).\n\nCrucial parameters that distinguish between the developed systems and introduce impor-\ntant characteristics of systems more generally can be readily identified. We show later\nthat the beam (or kinetic) power of the rocket exhaust, P , is given by\n\nP = 1/2 m?V 2e (6.1)\n\nwhere m? is the exhaust mass flow rate and Ve is the exhaust velocity.\nSince the thrust delivered by the rocket may be written\n\nF = m?Ve (6.2)\n\nthen\n\nP = 1/2 FVe (6.3)\n\nIf we introduce the vehicle acceleration (or vehicle thrust-to-weight ratio), ?g0, where g0\nis the Earth surface acceleration due to gravity, then we may write\n\nF ?

The\nseparately powered electric rocket is characterized by high exhaust velocity and low\nspecific power or thrust acceleration. Nuclear or chemical rockets, on the other hand,\noffer high powers but with relatively poor propellant utilization through their limited\nexhaust velocities. Booster operation from planetary surfaces is evidently restricted to\nthese latter systems which are said to be energy limited - by the chemical energy stored\nin the propellants - but which admit high thrust for comparatively modest engine weight.\nAlthough the specific impulses of electrically powered systems are high, they are power\nlimited . Whilst the energy available from the Sun is unlimited, or that from a radioactive\nsource introduces a negligible fuel mass, the effective energy density is low and the\nnecessary weight of the accompanying systems for electrical conversion is unacceptably\nlarge in high power applications. Electrically propelled space vehicles are thus restricted to\nvery small accelerations. As we shall describe in Section 6.3 the more efficient expellant\nutilization possible with low thrust systems thus appears most naturally suited to orbit-\nraising manoeuvres, interplanetary transfer and spacecraft attitude and orbit control.\n\nWhilst the role of propulsion is most clearly identified in relation to launch vehi-\ncles, spacecraft propulsion makes a number of equally important contributions to overall\nmission success. The range of tasks and performance requirements are illustrated below.\n\n\u2022 Launch vehicles - main engines and \u2018strap-on\u2019 boosters - developing continuous\nhigh thrust for periods of minutes (approximately 106 N for 9 min in the case of the\nVulcain 2 cryogenic main engine on Ariane 5, for example).\n\n\u2022 Apogee motors for spacecraft orbit circularization and inclination removal (typically,\n75 kN for approximately 60 seconds, developing a velocity increment of 2 km s?1);\nperigee motors for orbit raising from low-altitude parking orbit.\n\n\n\n180 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Spacecraft station-keeping, attitude and orbit control (thrust levels ranging from 10?3\nto 10 N, intermittent and pulsed operation over the complete duration of the mission).\n\nSince propulsive requirements are frequently specified in terms of ?V (see Chapter 5) it\nis instructive to compare some typical values:\n\n\u2022 ?V into low Earth orbit (including drag and gravity losses) ? 9.5 km s?1\n\u2022 additional ?V to equatorial geostationary orbit from a 30? inclined\n\nparking orbit\n?4.2 km s1\n\n\u2022 additional ?V for a Mars fly-by ?3.4 km s?1\n\u2022 additional ?V for Solar System escape (without gravitational assist) ?8.5 km s?1\n\u2022 geostationary orbit station-keeping (communications satellite)\n\nNorth-South (inclination < 0.1? throughout a 7\u2013year life) ?0.35 km s?1\nEast-West (\u00b10.1? of nominal longitude) ?0.03 km s?1\n\n6.2 CHEMICAL ROCKETS\n\nThe rapid growth in rocket propulsion technology following World War II is largely based\non chemical rockets. Simple reaction systems, in which the propulsive force exerted on a\nvehicle arises from changes in system momentum through the discharge of hot products of\ncombustion at high velocity, have proved uniquely successful in high thrust atmospheric\nand space applications. The burning of chemical propellants, solid or liquid, at high pres-\nsure liberates large quantities of energy in a compact volume. The subsequent expansion\nof these high temperature products of combustion through a convergent-divergent nozzle,\nconverts thermal energy to directed kinetic energy for rocket propulsion. Since the rocket\ncarries both fuel and oxidizer, the specific fuel consumption is substantially higher than\nthat of an air-breathing reaction system such as the turbojet. It is, however, mechanically\nless complex than an aircraft power plant since moving parts are confined to auxiliary\nsystems such as the propellant feed.\n\nWe show later in this section that chemical rockets are conveniently characterized by\nthe Tsiolkovsky equation (in field-free space):\n\n?V = Ve ln R (6.5)\nwhere ?V denotes the rocket velocity increment and R is the mass ratio, initial mass to\nmass at burn-out. ?V is typically prescribed by the mission whilst Ve is essentially fixed\nby the choice of propellant. Only by increasing the mass ratio in equation (6.5) can the\nshortfall in propellant energetics be accommodated and mission objectives attained.\n\n6.2.1 Basic principles\n\nWe first review briefly those aspects of rocket motor performance, gas dynamics and\nthermochemistry that most directly influence design and operation. For further details of\nthe analysis, the reader is referred to the excellent texts by Barrere et al. [5] and Sutton\nand Biblarz [6].\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ROCKETS 6.2 181\n\nExhaust plane\narea Ae \n\nMass M(t)\nV(t)\n\nVe relative to\nrocket\n\nPe\n\nPa\nAmbient Component of external force\n\n[drag, gravity, pressure]\n\nFigure 6.3 Schematic rocket\n\nPerformance parameters\n\nConsider the rocket illustrated schematically in Figure 6.3. Applying equation (3.18) from\nChapter 3 leads to\n\nM\ndV\n\ndt\n= m?Ve + Ae(pe ? pa) + Fext (6.6)\n\nThe rocket thrust F comprises two contributions, from the exhaust momentum flux and\nthe exhaust plane pressure difference:\n\nF = m?Ve + Ae(pe ? pa) (6.7)\n\nwhere m? is the propellant mass flow rate, Ve is the exhaust velocity, Ae(pe \u2014pa) is the\nresultant force on the rocket due to the pressure difference between the nozzle exit and\nthe ambient, and Fext denotes the extra force in the direction of motion due to external\nforces (for example, aerodynamic drag or gravity).\n\nWe show in the following section that nozzle performance, and in particular the exhaust\nvelocity Ve , is maximized by complete exhaust expansion to ambient pressure, whence\npe ? pa = 0. In space applications, the ambient pressure is either continuously varying\nwith altitude, or is zero beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The effects of any under-\nexpansion, pe > pa , are thus partially offset by the thrust increase accompanying this\npressure difference.\n\nFrom equation (6.7) the thrust at sea level is\n\nFSL = m?Ve + Ae(pe ? pSL)\n\nand at altitude h it may be expressed as\n\nFh = FSL + Ae(pSL ? ph) (6.8)\n\nIn vacuo, when ph = 0, it becomes\n\nF0 = FSL + Ae pSL\nTypically AepSL/FSL approaches 20%.\n\n\n\n182 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nIt is convenient to define an effective exhaust velocity\n\nV ?e = Ve + Ae(pe ? pa)/m? ? ISP g0 (6.9)\n\nwhere g0 is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth surface.\nISP is the specific impulse, the total impulse per unit propellant weight consumed, and is\ngiven by\n\nISP = I\nMpg0\n\n=\n\nt?\n0\n\nF (t) dt\n\ng0\nt?\n\n0\nm?(t) dt\n\n(6.10)\n\nwhence ISP = F/m?g0 for constant thrust and exhaust mass flow rate.\nEquation (6.6) may be expressed in terms of V ?e and, when this is constant, it may be\nintegrated over the duration of rocket motor firing giving\n\n?V = Vb ?

If the nozzle flow is overexpanded , pe < pa , pressure recovery\nto ambient conditions is effected through a series of shock waves. Penetration of these\nshock waves into the nozzle leads to separation of the wall boundary layers, enhanced\nviscous losses and a reduced expansion ratio.

Continuous\nadaptation ; sea level adaptation _\n\nat high ambient pressure, typical of sea-level or test-bed firing. Underexpanded flows are\ncharacterized by incomplete nozzle expansion, pe > pa , and reduced exhaust velocity.\nThe low ambient pressures that give rise to such flows are typically realized in space\nvacuum operation.\n\nFigure 6.7 illustrates the thrust improvement that would result from continuous adap-\ntation of the nozzle geometry, leading to pe = pa , with increasing altitude, and hence\nreducing pa , in comparison with the thrust of an ideally expanded nozzle at sea level.\nThe expansion ratio Ae/At of the nozzle becomes very large, however, and signifi-\ncant weight penalties may result. Careful optimization is necessary to reconcile these\ncompeting factors.\n\nThe thrust coefficient in equation (6.21) can be modified to include the effects of\nnon-ideal expansion in the form\n\nCF = F\npcAt\n\n= C 0F +\nAe\nAt\n\n(\npe\npc\n\n? pa\npc\n\n)\n(6.23)\n\nThe thrust coefficient for ideal expansion , given pc , pa and At is, from equation (6.21),\n\n{C 0F }max =\n????\n\n{\n2? 2\n\n? ? 1\n(\n\n2\n\n? + 1\n)(?+1)/(??1) [\n\n1 ?\n(\n\npa\npc\n\n)(??1)/? ]}\n\nand with equation (6.22) we write\n\nCF\n{C 0F }max\n\n= C\n0\nF\n\n{C 0F }max\n+\n\n?\n(\n\n2\n(?+1)\n\n)(?+1)/(??1) (\npc\npe\n\n)\nC 0F {C 0F }max\n\n1\n?

This observation also suggests an\naerodynamic approach to varying the nozzle geometry, which is otherwise mechanically\ncumbersome\u2014namely, one of controlled fluid injection through the nozzle wall which\ninduces local flow separation and thereby modifies the nozzle contour.\n\nAs indicated earlier, nozzle adaptation has important implications for nozzle size and\nweight. From the manufacturing point of view, convergent-divergent nozzles that are\nconical represent the simplest designs. Two specific problems then arise, however:\n\n\u2022 the exhaust is not directed in the axial direction and the flow divergence implies\nsome loss of thrust;\n\n\u2022 in high altitude applications the nozzle tends to be long and correspondingly heavy.\n\nThe axial thrust may be shown to be approximately\n\nF = 1\n2\n\nm?Ve(1 + cos ?)\n\nfor cone included angle 2?. For ? = 15? the multiplicative factor 12 (1 + cos ?) is 0.986\nand the effect of divergence is generally small.\n\nDesigns to reduce nozzle length, and hence weight, resulting from small divergence\nangles, must expand the flow from the throat more rapidly and subsequently turn the\nexhaust in the axial direction. Bell-shaped nozzles are designed to achieve this\u2014see, for\nexample, the established procedure due to Rao [7].\n\nThe benefits of continuous nozzle adaptation are particularly apparent in relation to\nsingle-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) concepts. Whilst the performance compromise introduced by\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ROCKETS 6.2 189\n\nThrust cell\n(10 per bank)\n\nJet boundary\n(low altitude,\nmoderate ambient pressure)\n\nJet boundary\n(high altitude,\nlow ambient pressure)\n\nEngine base\n\nNozzle ramp\n\nFigure 6.9 Schematic of linear aerospike nozzle\n\nnot doing so, and adopting fixed geometry nozzles, may be quite modest in a multi-stage\nlauncher, the SSTO confronts the nozzle design with a progressively reducing ambient\npressure over the complete range from sea-level static to vacuum conditions. Unlike\nthe conventional convergent-divergent nozzle, the truncated plug nozzle or aerospike\n(Figure 6.9) is bounded by a solid wall (ramp) on only one side, with the combustor\nefflux expanding against the local ambient pressure on the other. The extent of such\nexpansion is thereby adapted to the changing altitude and varies continuously over\nthe vehicle trajectory. When allied to a lifting body configuration as in the Lockheed\nMartin VentureStar reusable launch vehicle (RLV) concept, or the X-33 demonstrator,\nthe linear aerospike also offers opportunities for propulsion system integration and\nbase-drag reduction [8].\n\nThermochemistry\n\nWe identified from equation (6.20) that the basic elements in maximizing exhaust velocity\n(or specific impulse) were a high combustion chamber temperature and pressure, and low\nmolecular weight. The variation of these properties in relation to some representative\npropellant combinations will be illustrated later.\n\nIn developing equations for the ideal rocket motor, we assumed that, in addition to\nisentropic flow (no viscous or heat losses), the combustion products were of known\nconstant composition throughout the expansion. At the high temperatures of interest,\nhowever, a significant proportion of combustion products are dissociated and the extent\nto which the energy of dissociation can be recovered in the expansion has a substantial\nimpact on nozzle performance.\n\n\n\n190 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nIn the expansion process, the variation of composition with position in the nozzle\ndepends upon both local thermodynamic state\u2014pressure and temperature\u2014and chemical\nkinetic rates, in particular, upon recombination rates. A complete description is complex\nand beyond the scope of this chapter, but two limiting cases are readily distinguished:\n\n\u2022 frozen flow, in which the composition remains constant throughout the expansion\nirrespective of the variation in pressure and temperature; and\n\n\u2022 equilibrium flow, in which the equilibrium composition corresponding to local con-\nditions of pressure and temperature prevails along the nozzle.\n\nThe former implies that the chemical rates are vanishingly small, whilst the latter\nimplies that they are infinitely fast.\n\nAs the temperature decreases along the nozzle, species dissociated in the combus-\ntion chamber recombine, releasing energy and changing the composition. Whilst specific\nimpulse (or thrust coefficient) is therefore predicted to be larger for equilibrium flow at a\nparticular pressure ratio (pc/pe), the accompanying area ratio Ae/At is also larger.\n\n6.2.2 Propellants\n\nIn principle, any chemical system producing heat release in a gas flow through exothermic\nreaction could be used as a propellant. In practice, consideration of a range of additional\nfactors such as the specific energy content, rate of heat release, ease of storage and han-\ndling significantly limits the choice. Heat release in a liquid-propellant rocket may be\nachieved through the separate injection, mixing and combustion of two liquids\u2014fuel and\noxidizer\u2014as in a bipropellant system, or the exothermic decomposition of a monopro-\npellant such as hydrazine or hydrogen peroxide. A bi-propellant is said to be hypergolic\nif the fuel and oxidizer react spontaneously on contact with each other. More generally,\nthe requirements of separate propellant storage, of pumping and feed to the injector, of\nmixing and ignition mean that the high specific impulse is achieved at the expense of\nconsiderable complexity in design and manufacture. Significant flexibility in operation is,\nhowever, gained, including stop-start options and throttling of thrust levels. In contrast,\nthe solid propellant rocket is of comparatively simple design. The propellant is stored\nwithin the combustion chamber in the form of shaped grains bounded by the walls of\nthe chamber. Once ignited, combustion will generally proceed until all the propellant is\nconsumed; the thrust-time relationship is then fixed by the grain configuration. Limited\nthrust regulation is possible.\n\nCombinations of solid fuel and a liquid or gaseous oxidizer (usually identified as hybrid\nsystems) attracted the interest of early rocketry pioneers [6] and this has continued within\namateur rocket societies on grounds of comparatively low cost, modest technical complex-\nity and reduced hazard. Hybrid motors have grown in scale in recent years, however, under\nthe stimulus of international competitions such as the Ansari X Prize\u2014awarded to \u2018Scaled\nComposites\u2019 SpaceShipOne in 2004 [9] which employed a nitrous oxide (N2O)/HTPB\nhybrid\u2014and the many projected developments in space tourism more generally. Research\non solid fuel ramjets for missile applications has also exposed some technological chal-\nlenges in common, for example, when seeking to optimize the configuration of oxidizer\ninjector and solid propellant grain for sustained levels of high heat release.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ROCKETS 6.2 191\n\nTable 6.1 Liquid propellants\n\nFuel Oxidizer Molecular Combustion Ideal Mean\nweight of temperature specific density\nproducts Tc (K) impulse (s) kg/m3\n\nH2 (hydrogen) O2 (oxygen) 10 2980 390 280\nF2 (fluorine) 12.8 4117 410 460\n\nKerosine O2 23.4 3687 301 1020\nF2 23.9 3917 320 1230\nRFNA (red fuming\n\nnitric acid)\n25.7 3156 268 1355\n\nN2O4 (nitrogen\ntetroxide)\n\n26.2 3460 276 1260\n\nH2O2 (hydrogen\nperoxide)\n\n22.2 3008 278 1362\n\nN2H4 (hydrazine) O2 19.4 3410 313 1070\nHNO3 (nitric\n\nacid)?\n20 2967 278 1310\n\nUDMH O2 21.5 3623 310 970\n(CH3)2NNH3 HNO?3 23.7 3222 276 1220\n(unsymmetrical dimethyl\n\nhydrazine)\n? hypergolic\n\nMonopropellants\nN2H4 10.3 966 199 1011\nH2O2 22.7 1267 165 1422\n\n?Note: All quoted values are for pc = 7 MPa with an ideal expansion to pe = 0.1 MPa. Higher chamber pressures admit\nincreases in ISP \u2014for example, at 20 MPa, LOX/LH2 yields a specific impulse of ?460 s.\n\nLiquid propellants\n\nTable 6.1 illustrates properties of some representative propellants. We recall from equation\n(6.10) that in order to maximize exhaust velocity we seek propellants which give high\ncombustion temperatures and low molecular weight products. Peak temperatures accom-\npany the burning of approximately stoichiometric mixtures \u2014that is, mixtures containing\njust sufficient oxidizer to convert the chemical elements in the fuel to stable combus-\ntion products. The typical variation of adiabatic flame temperature with mixture strength\nexhibits only a modest decline in Tc for richer-than-stoichiometric mixtures, however.\nIt is thus possible to maintain high combustion temperatures with hydrogen as fuel, for\nexample, and capitalize on the low fuel molecular weight by operating fuel rich.\n\nFrom the table, the attraction of fluorine as an oxidizer (high combustion tempera-\nture, WF = 19) is tempered by its highly corrosive properties which constrain the choice\nof liner materials for the combustion chamber and nozzle. Both oxygen and fluorine\nnecessitate cryogenic storage as liquids since they have boiling points of 90 K and 85 K\nrespectively. Long-term storage is therefore difficult and their application is restricted to\nlaunch vehicles. Nitrogen tetroxide has found increased application in space propulsion as\nan oxidizer, despite its high molecular weight (WN2O4 = 92). This is in part because it has\n\n\n\n192 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\na boiling point of 294 K at suitable storage pressures and, though highly toxic, systems\nfor its supply and management are generally simpler and lighter.\n\nThe traditional, high thrust bi-propellant combinations of LOX/LH2, employed on Sat-\nurn V, the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) and the Vulcain motor of Ariane 5,\nfor example, are complemented in apogee motors and orbital manoeuvring systems gen-\nerally by monomethylhydrazine (MMH)/N2O4 combinations. The latter offers a specific\nimpulse of approximately 310 s, a value that is significantly greater than that available from\nmonopropellant hydrazine decomposition, the readily stored\u2014but less stable\u2014alternative\n(boiling point 387 K). In the context of thermal control during propellant storage, we\nshould note that both hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide have melting points in the neigh-\nbourhood of typical spacecraft ambient temperatures, 275 K and 262 K respectively.\n\nSolid propellants\n\nSolid propellants are typically of two types: either double-base, comprising homogeneous\ncolloidal mixtures of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, or composite, comprising mixtures\nof an organic fuel and crystalline inorganic salt. Ammonium perchlorate, NH4ClO4, is\nthe principal oxidizer used in composite propellants with a polymer fuel-binder, typically\npolyurethane or polybutadiene.\n\nIn comparison with the liquid propellants described in Table 6.1, the specific impulses\nfor solid propellants are substantially lower\u2014in the range 200\u2013260 s. These values are\nnot strongly influenced by the particular fuel binder, although high hydrogen to carbon\nratios are favoured. The performance of composite propellants is improved by the addition\nof metals such as aluminium or beryllium in the form of finely ground particles (?10 ?m).\n\nSolid propellant charges are typically cast or extruded. The components are mixed in\nthe form of a dough, perhaps in the presence of a plasticizer, and cast or pumped into a\nmould or directly into the combustion chamber. The grain geometry is fixed by a mandrel\nwhich is removed after curing and solidification.\n\nFurther information on propellant energetics and physical properties is available in\nReference [6]; the complexities of solid propellant combustion are discussed extensively\nin Kuo and Summerfield [10].\n\nHybrid rockets\n\nThe oxidizers in common use in liquid bi-propellant systems (cryogenic LOX and storable\nNTO (nitrogen tetroxide), for example) can be used with solid hydrocarbon-based fuels\nsuch as HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) to create energetic hybrids that offer\nmuch of the simplicity of design and robustness in operation of solid composite pro-\npellants together with the enhanced levels of performance and controllability typical of\nbi-propellants. Heat release in such heterogeneous systems is generally more sensitive to\nflow and mixing conditions in the turbulent boundary layer over the solid fuel, however,\nand they can rarely match the levels of specific impulse achieved with energetic liquid bi-\npropellants. Hybrid product densities are, however, higher and density-weighted specific\nimpulses may exceed those of liquid bipropellants. Hybrid exhausts are also generally\ncleaner than those of solid propellants, reducing observables for tactical missiles and\nperhaps suggesting broader \u2018green\u2019 credentials. In less demanding roles that admit lower\nlevels of thrust, nitrous oxide - which is readily gasified though storable as a liquid-when\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ROCKETS 6.2 193\n\ninjected into simple grain geometries of PMMA (perspex) or polyethylene (PE) has found\nsuccessful application with rocket enthusiasts.\n\n6.2.3 Chemical rocket design\n\nIn this section we seek to identify some of the more important features of motor design\nin relation to high thrust launch vehicles or booster applications. A detailed discussion\nof such a major topic is inappropriate to this book which seeks more to familiarize the\nnon-specialist with the diversity of disciplines and technologies at the heart of spacecraft\nengineering. More specific design issues are addressed in much greater detail in Huzel\nand Huang [11]. From the standpoint of spacecraft design, the involvement with the\nlaunch vehicle lies essentially in the role of procurement and the clear identification of\nthe constraints that are imposed on the spacecraft by the launcher. These form the basis\nof Chapter 7, whilst the design of spacecraft propulsion systems, of more direct concern\nto the spacecraft engineer, is discussed in Sections 6.3 and 6.4.\n\nIf we distinguish the principal rocket components to be:\n\n\u2022 the thrust chamber,\n\u2022 the propellant feed system, and\n\u2022 the propellant storage tanks,\n\nthen significant differences are evident between solid and liquid propellant devices. For the\nsolid propellant rocket, offering high thrusts of short duration, key features of the design\nare the choice of propellant grain to give the appropriate thrust law and of materials\nselection for the nozzle and casing to combine low weight with reliable operation. The\ngreater complexity of the liquid propellant rocket requires that consideration be given\nto thrust chamber design in respect of such components as the fuel injector, cooling\nsystem and propellant feed. In the case of the launch vehicle, demanding especially high\npropellant mass flow rates, both the gas generator and turbopump designs then become\ncritical aspects.\n\nLiquid propellant rockets\n\nA typical liquid propellant rocket motor is illustrated in Figure 6.10. Liquid fuel and\noxygen are pumped into the main combustion chamber by turbopumps driven by a separate\nhot gas generator, burning small quantities of the propellants. The starter cartridge is\ntypically a small solid propellant gas generator.\n\nTwo important classes of engine in which fuel and oxidant are supplied by turbopumps\nare differentiated by their description as open or closed cycle designs. In the open cycle, the\nturbine exhaust is discharged into the nozzle downstream from the combustion chamber\nat modest pressure in the expanding section or simply discharged to atmosphere, making\nno direct thrust contribution. By contrast, in the closed cycle the exhaust is injected\nat high pressure into the combustion chamber, contributing significantly to the energy\nof the system. The improved performance of the latter cycle must be set against the\ndisadvantage of more complex turbopump design necessary to operate at much greater\ndischarge pressures.\n\n\n\n194 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nFuel Oxygen\n\nTurbopumps\n\nExhaust\n\nCombustor\n\nNozzle\n\nStarter\n\nGas generator\n\nFigure 6.10 Schematic of a liquid rocket motor\n\nTwo open cycle configurations are illustrated in Figure 6.11: a separate gas generator\ncycle of the kind employed in the HM-7 and Vulcain engines of Ariane 5, and a coolant\ntap-off cycle in which vaporized hydrogen fuel from the nozzle coolant jacket drives the\nturbine. The turbine power is comparatively low in the latter case but the complexity of\nthe design is much reduced. Also illustrated is the closed cycle, staged combustion cycle\nemployed in the SSME. All the fuel and part of the oxidizer are there supplied to a pre-\ncombustor at high pressure. The high energy fuel-rich exhaust first drives the turbopumps\nand is then injected into the main combustion chamber with the remaining oxidizer.\n\nAn illustrative comparison between open and closed cycle engines is presented in\nTable 6.2, where SSME performance characteristics are summarized together with those\nof the Ariane 5 Vulcain engine. The gas generator consumes approximately 3.5% of the\navailable propellant and the closed cycle engine, also incorporating a much greater cham-\nber pressure (approximately two-fold higher), yields a vacuum specific impulse some 5%\ngreater. The necessarily higher turbopump discharge pressures for both fuel and oxidizer in\nthe staged combustion cycle imply significantly more extensive design and development in\nturbines, pumps and ancillary equipment. A simpler closed cycle is the expander cycle\nin which vaporized fuel drives the turbopumps but, in contrast to the coolant bleed cycle\nillustrated, all of the fuel is so employed and subsequently passes into the combustion\nchamber.

Higher chamber pressures and\nincreased thrust are thereby restricted in turn [12].\n\nThe configurations shown all employ an element of regenerative cooling. Fuel or oxi-\ndizer may be used as a coolant, flowing through a jacket surrounding the thrust chamber.\n\n\n\n196 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nThe heat absorbed in this way, necessary in prolonged firings, enhances the initial energy\ncontent of the propellants prior to injection into the combustion chamber.\n\nSolid propellant rockets\n\nBy contrast, solid propellant rockets are comparatively inflexible in their design. The\ngross classification of solid rockets is made on the basis of the propellant grain geometry\nsince, once ignited, erosive burning proceeds to propellant exhaustion. The rate at which\ngaseous product is discharged during combustion is characterized by the propellant surface\nregression rate (typically in the range 5\u201310 mm/s) and by the variation of total burning\nsurface area with time. Together with the product density and chamber pressure, they\ndetermine both the thrust level and the thrust-time history.\n\nA propellant grain is said to be neutral if the thrust remains broadly constant throughout\nthe firing, with a burning surface area that is independent of time. Such behaviour would be\ncharacteristic of \u2018cigarette\u2019 burning as illustrated in Figure 6.12. In practice a convenient\ncylindrical geometry would insist that the burning surface area be small and hence of\nlimited thrust. An annular grain, on the other hand, that burns from the inner surface\noutwards is progressive. The exposed area, and hence the thrust, increases with time. A\nlarge surface area for burning initially, combined with a period of roughly neutral thrust\nperformance, is provided by the star-shaped cylindrical grain illustrated. The changing\ninternal profile with time will give rise to two-stage burning, combining aspects of both\nprogressive and regressive behaviour. The latter accompanies a decreasing exposed area,\nas in the case of the external burning of a rod or, with the star-shaped grain, as an initially\ncorrugated boundary is progressively smoothed and simplified as combustion proceeds.\n\nTime\n\nTime\n\nTime\n\nThrust\n\nThrust\n\nThrust\n\nConstant cross-section,\n\u2018cigarette\u2019 burning-\nsmall surface area and\ntherefore limited\nthrust.\n\nFigure 6.12 Solid propellant grain geometries\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ROCKETS 6.2 197\n\nIgniter Nozzle\n\nTapering grain cross-section\n\n- Propellant mass 5.0 \u00d7 105 kg, Inert mass 8.2 \u00d7 104 kg  \n- Vacuum thrust 11.8 \u00d7 106 N\n- Specific impulse ~ 260 seconds.\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n50 100 150\n\nThrust\n(\u00d7 106 N)\n\nBurn time (s)\n\nFigure 6.13 Space Shuttle solid rocket booster\n\nVariations in grain geometry along the length of the propellant charge permit the further\ntailoring of the thrust-time relationship to the requirements of the mission. The configura-\ntion and performance of the solid rocket boosters used on the Space Shuttle are illustrated\nin Figure 6.13.\n\nSolid propellant ignition is typically effected by a pyrotechnic or pyrogen igniter. A\nsmall quantity of heat sensitive powdered explosive is ignited electrically and the heat\nreleased in turn ignites the propellant within the igniter. Typical igniter compounds are\naluminium, boron or magnesium, combined with potassium perchlorate or nitrate oxidiz-\ners. In laterally burning cylindrical grains, the igniter is placed at the end of the chamber\nfurthest from the nozzle so that the hot products of combustion from the igniter sweep\nacross the whole grain. Main charge ignition then occurs through convective and radiative\nheat transfer from these products, the balance between these processes being determined\nby the detailed igniter design.\n\n6.2.4 Alternative high\u2013speed air-breathing propulsion\n\nA review of typical first-stage rocket performance as described in Chapter 7 reveals that\napproximately 55% of the launch mass is consumed in accelerating the vehicle to 20% of\nthe orbital speed. The bulk of this propellant\u2014consumed within the Earth atmosphere\u2014is\noxidizer. Such bare statistics provide a prima facie case for investigation of the contribu-\ntion that air-breathing propulsion might make to the initial stages of a space launch.\n\nFigure 6.14 identifies the key propulsive options for high-speed air-breathing with\nhydrogen as fuel. Current turbomachinery, familiar from the aircraft jet engine, becomes\nincreasingly unattractive thermodynamically at Mach numbers (ratio of flight speed to\n\n\n\n198 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\nMach number\n\nS\np\n\nec\nif\n\nic\n im\n\np\nu\n\nls\ne \n\n(s\n)\n\nS\np\n\nec\nif\n\nic\n im\n\np\nu\n\nls\ne \n\n(s\n)\n\n10 12 14 16\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nTurbojets\n\nRamjets\n\nHydrogen fuel\n\nScramjet\n\nRockets\n\nCombined cycle\ninitial acceleration\nmodes.\n(many candidates)\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\nFigure 6.14 High-speed propulsion options in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n\nsound speed) in excess of 3 and relatively high specific impulses can then be achieved\nmore simply, and efficiently, by capitalizing on ram compression. In the conventional\nramjet, however, the ingested air is diffused down to subsonic Mach numbers prior to\nmixing with fuel and combustion. Isentropic (shock-free) subsonic diffusion leads to\na substantial temperature rise, from T to T0, which increases quadratically with Mach\nnumber, M\n\nT0\nT\n\n= 1 + 1\n2\n(? ? 1)M 2\n\nFor M > 4 ? 5, heat transfer and dissociation losses in the combustor begin to erode\nsubsonic-combustion ramjet performance significantly. However, technologies required by\nthese engines are well established and their range of application may be further extended\nby the judicious use of high fuel heat capacity in a range of thermal protection and heat\nexchanger strategies, even embracing air liquefaction. The intimate relationship between\nvehicle trajectory, kinetic heating and combustion stability is illustrated in Figure 6.15. The\ntarget condition for launcher first stage burn-out identified earlier, at 30 km altitude, corre-\nsponds to a Mach number of 5.5 and, at such speeds and beyond, the supersonic combus-\ntion ramjet (SCRAMJET) is the more attractive prospect. The temperature rise associated\nwith diffusion to low subsonic Mach numbers prior to combustion is avoided by burning\nthe fuel in a supersonic air stream but the necessary technologies for efficient high-speed\nmixing, ignition and stable burning remain incompletely understood. Residence times in\nthe combustor become very short and comparable with the ignition delay for the fuel.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ROCKETS 6.2 199\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\nMach number\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\nCombustion\nlimits\n\nScramjets\n\nRamjets\n\nTurbojets\n\nJP Methane Hydrogen\nApplicable\nfuels\n\nHeat transfer and\npressure limits\n\nFigure 6.15 Constraints on air breathing trajectories\n\nBy comparison with rockets, air-breathing engines offer relatively modest thrust-to-\nweight ratios and composite engines that seek to use common components over a wide\nrange of flight regimes and operating conditions are crucial to successful SSTO design.\nCycle performance analyses and engine simulations have attracted recurrent research\ninterest throughout the recent decades as evidenced, for example, by the two-stage\nSANGER [13] and National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) programmes [14]. Despite\nimprovements in materials technology and simulation tools, advanced design remains\nproblematic and the development costs intimidating. Current projects therefore favour\nmore conventional rocket technology that facilitates the inclusion of reusable elements\n(see [15]). Hybrid propellants may prove to offer more cost effective options than those\ncurrently employed, however.\n\n6.2.5 Propellant management\n\nThe operation of liquid propellant rockets for space vehicle applications may expose\nthe propulsion system to a dynamical regime not usually encountered in terrestrial\napplications, namely that of free-fall or low residual acceleration. We shall briefly review\nhere some aspects of the problems encountered that do not have a ready analogue in\n1g0 environments.\n\nThe near free-fall situations typical of space manoeuvres or residual drag in Earth orbit\ncorrespond to\n\n|glocal ? avehicle| = O(10?6g0)\n\n\n\n200 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nThe very small weights associated with such levels of acceleration invite consideration\nof other forces, like surface tension, and of equilibrium conditions that might usually be\nconsidered to be insignificant except on very small physical scales.\n\nLiquids may be conveniently characterized as wetting (surface spreading) or non-\nwetting. Liquid to solid surface contact angles may approach zero for perfectly wet-\nting liquids, typical of cryogenics, but may exceed 90\n\n?\nfor non-wetting liquids such as\n\nmercury (which is employed in some ion engines, as discussed in Section 6.4). The\nsurface tension of LOX (at 90 K) is approximately 13 \u00d7 10?3 N m?1, compared with\n460 \u00d7 10?3 N m?1 for mercury and 72 \u00d7 10?3 N m?1 for water. The range of variation is\ntherefore wide.\n\nIt is convenient to review the significance of the several forces prevailing in liquid\npropellants by introducing the following dimensionless parameters:\n\nBond number, B0 ? gravity\nsurface tension\n\nforces\n\n= ?L2g/?\n\nand Weber number, We ? inertia\nsurface tension\n\nforces\n\n= ?V 2L/?\n\nWe may then distinguish the respective inertia, capillary and gravity dominated regimes as\nsuggested in Figure 6.16. For B0 > 1, gravitational forces predominate and surface tension\nmay be neglected, and vice versa . We note that for surface tension to be significant\nin a 1 g0 (Earth surface) environment for a liquid such as water, then B0 < 1 implies\na characteristic length scale of less than 2 mm and effects like capillary rise are only\nsignificant at such small physical scales. For liquid oxygen in a residual micro-gravity\nenvironment, however, the same B0 boundary corresponds to a length scale of 1 m.\n\n10?2 10?1 10\nBo\n\n102\n\nGravity\ndominated\n\nCapillary\ndominated\n\nInertia\ndominated\n\n10?1\n\n10?2\n\n102\n\n10\n\nWe\n\nFigure 6.16 Distinctive regimes for forces acting on liquids\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL ROCKETS 6.2 201\n\nThe equilibrium configuration of a liquid propellant in a partially filled tank under\nmicrogravity conditions is determined essentially by the minimization of droplet (or\nbubble) free energy which is proportional to the surface area. A wetting liquid will there-\nfore preferentially adhere to tank walls, rather than assume a freely suspended droplet\nconfiguration. Internal surfaces and screens within tanks can be used to collect the liquid\nand separate it from the vapour. Active measures must clearly be adopted to ensure that\nliquid propellant is available at the tank outlet for rocket motor starting. The principal\noptions for propellant storage and delivery are shown schematically in Figure 6.17 and\ncomprise inertial (or bottoming), positive expulsion and capillary (or surface tension) sys-\ntems. Supercritical storage is usually ruled out on grounds of tank weight. These options\nare described in more detail by Ring [16].\n\nIn addition to the problem of propellant configuration within the tank, the response to\ndynamic excitation in flight in the form of propellant sloshing may also be important.\nThe viscosity of cryogenic propellants is in general low, typically by more than an order\nof magnitude in comparison with water (or hydrazine). The damping of free surface\noscillation in the fluid which would otherwise give rise to substantial fluctuating forces\nand moments on the tanks may also require active provision in the form of turbulence-\ngenerating baffles.\n\nLiquid propellant\n\nVapour\n\nTrapped vapour\nin 'bottomed'\npropellant\n\nSustained acceleration\nto separate phases\n\n'Bottoming acceleration'\n\nPressurant\n\nDiaphragm\n\nOutflow\n\nPiston\n\nInflatable\n\nbladder\n\nCapillary screen\n\nFigure 6.17 Illustrative propellant storage and delivery systems\n\n\n\n202 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\n6.3 SPACECRAFT PROPULSION\n\nThe typical functions of spacecraft propulsion, as distinct from launcher operations from\nthe Earth surface, may be summarized, in order of reducing thrust level, as follows:\n\n\u2022 final orbit acquisition from the initial orbit established by the launch vehicle,\n\u2022 station-keeping and orbit control, and\n\u2022 attitude control.\n\nGeneral principles in relation to both solid and liquid propellant rockets have\nbeen reviewed in earlier sections. Here we shall focus on factors influencing the\nchoice of systems appropriate to the spacecraft propulsion roles set out above. The\nprincipal options are cold gas systems, monopropellant hydrazine, bi-propellant nitrogen\ntetroxide/monomethylhydrazine combinations, solid propellants and electric propulsion.\nWe shall briefly consider each of these in turn. Further detail on preliminary design\nmethods appropriate to such devices is provided by Brown [17]. Generally, the\nspacecraft\u2019s propulsion system associated with attitude and orbit control is often referred\nto as secondary propulsion , whereas the propulsion system performing functions such as\norbit transfer is referred to as primary propulsion .\n\nThe increased interest in very small satellites such as typified by CubeSat projects,\nhaving a mass of ?1 kg within a cube of size ?0.1 m, has directed research into efficient\nmicropropulsion functions, frequently calling for microfabrication techniques [18].\n\n6.3.1 Cold gas systems\n\nThese systems simply comprise an inert gas, typically nitrogen, argon, freon, or a hydro-\ncarbon like propane, which is stored at high pressure and fed to a number of small\nthrusters. In the absence of combustion heat release, the kinetic energy of the nozzle\nexhaust is then solely determined by the driving pressure in the reservoir. A schematic\nof a typical system is shown in Figure 6.18. Propellants are selected for the simplicity of\ntheir storage and compatibility with other facets of spacecraft operation such as the effect\nof exhaust plume impingement on sensitive surfaces, solar cells, sensors and detectors.\n\nThrust levels are small, typically of the order of 10 mN; levels chosen to provide the\nsmall impulse bits required for high pointing accuracy and stable, jitter free viewing.\nMinimum impulse bits of approximately 10?4 Ns are often necessary for better than 0.1?\n\naccuracy in attitude control on some of the larger scientific satellites.\nThe specific impulse from cold gas systems is comparatively small (?50 s)\u2014reflecting\n\nthe reduced reservoir temperature and pressure (Tc and pc in equation 6.20). The expellant\nmass is relatively unimportant, however, in the fine-pointing role. Missions requiring larger\n?V s for secondary propulsion do, on the other hand, necessitate higher performance\npropellants in order to reduce the system mass.\n\n6.3.2 Monopropellant hydrazine\n\nAs we described in Section 6.2, the decomposition of anhydrous hydrazine (N2H4), either\nthermally or catalytically, to the products nitrogen, ammonia and hydrogen is exothermic.\n\n\n\nSPACECRAFT PROPULSION 6.3 203\n\nPropane\ntanks\n\nFilter\n\nThrusters\n\nFill\nvalve\n\nPlenum\nchamber\n\nFigure 6.18 Schematic of a cold gas propulsion system\n\nExpansion of the hot product gas through a nozzle will yield specific impulses in the\nrange 200\u2013250 s. The propellant is readily stored as a liquid, with a freezing point of\n275 K and boiling point of 387 K, in tanks under the pressure of an inert gas such as\nnitrogen or helium.\n\nA representative electrothermal hydrazine thruster configuration is sketched in\nFigure 6.19. The low temperature monopropellant decomposition is enhanced by a\nresistively-heated metal catalyst - commonly platinum/iridium dispersed on a large\nsurface area, porous substrate of aluminium oxide. Thruster performance is enhanced by\nhigher temperature operation but the accompanying heat transfer losses and materials\ncompatibility problems also increase.\n\nThrust levels ?10 N may be required for orbit control duties and combinations of\nthrusters are sized accordingly. Figure 6.20 illustrates the configuration employed on a\ngeostationary satellite for which station-keeping (N-S, using the yaw thrusters, and E-W)\nwas a primary consideration. The propellant tanks are of a positive expulsion (elastomeric\ndiaphragm) type, cross-linked between the paired thrusters.\n\nHydrazine\nN2 H4\n\nHypodermic\ninjector\n\nStored liquid\n- properties\nsimilar to water\n\nElectrical\nheater\n\nGauze pack\n\nFigure 6.19 Schematic of an electrothermal hydrazine thruster\n\n\n\n204 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nN2\n\nN2H4 N2H4\nN2H4 N2H4\n\nFill and drain\nvalves N2H4\n\nPropellant tanks\n\nLatching valves\n\nPressure\ntransducers\n\nFill and drain valve N2 H4\n\nHigh impulse\nthrusters\n\nLow impulse\nthrusters\n\nNorthSouth\n\nFilters\n\nN2 N2 N2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\n13\n\n15\n\n17\n\n19\n\n10\n\n12\n9\n\n11\n\nRoll+\n\nRoll?\n\nPitch+\n\nPitch?\n\nYaw+\n\nYaw?\n\nWest\n\nEast\n\nRoll-yaw+\n\nRoll-yaw?\n\nFigure 6.20 Illustrative spacecraft propulsion system using monopropellant thrusters\n\nImproved levels of specific impulse are possible if the exothermic decomposition stage\nis followed by further resistance-heating in a tandem design. Temperature limitations on\nthe nozzle materials, given the corrosive nature of the product gases, restrict the extent\nof additional heating but specific impulses approaching 300 s have been achieved.\n\n6.3.3 Bi-propellant MMH/nitrogen tetroxide\n\nThe increasing size of many spacecraft, particularly into geostationary orbit, implies the\nallocation of substantial propellant budgets for secondary propulsion systems and greater\nemphasis on the level of specific impulse delivered. The combination of MMH and N2O4\nwill provide specific impulses in excess of 300 s.\n\nA representative scheme for a geostationary spacecraft, incorporating the functions of\nboth orbit raising and AOCS, is illustrated in Figure 6.21. The propellants are hypergolic\nand the layout reflects the additional complexity introduced to ensure safe handling in\nthe propellant storage and feed to the thrusters. The propellants are stored in roughly\nequal volumes and are both compatible with readily available materials\u2014typically, stain-\nless steel, aluminium or titanium. The accompanying positive expulsion systems employ\nsimilar metals in the design of internal bellows since the oxidizer is not compatible with\nmost elastomers.\n\n\n\nSPACECRAFT PROPULSION 6.3 205\n\nHelium pressurant tanks\n\nPressure sensor\n\nPressure regulator\n\nNormally open\npyrotechnic valve\n\nPressure\nrelief valve\n\nNon-return\n         valve\n\nNormally closed\npyrotechnic valve\n\nMMH tank\n\nPressure\nsensors\n\nLatching valves\n\nN2O4 tank\n\nFilter Filter\n\nThrusters Thrusters\n\nApogee motor\n\nFigure 6.21 Schematic of a typical bi-propellant propulsion system\n\n6.3.4 Solid propellant apogee motors\n\nIn the emplacement sequence for a communications spacecraft into geostationary orbit,\nusing an expendable launch vehicle such as Ariane, the final stage injects the satellite\ninto an elliptical transfer orbit with apogee at geostationary height. Historically, but less\nfrequently now, the circularization manoeuvre can be achieved through a high thrust, short\nduration burn from a solid propellant apogee boost motor (ABM). For a satellite with an\non-station mass of approximately 1000 kg, the necessary apogee motor fuel approaches\n900 kg and the propulsive ?V is roughly 2 km s?1.\n\n\n\n206 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nPropellant\n\nPyrogen\n\nInsulation\n\nNozzle\n\nAttachment\nrings\n\nFigure 6.22 Schematic of a solid propellant apogee motor\n\nA typical solid rocket motor for primary propulsion duties is illustrated in Figure 6.22.\nAn example of such a solid propellant ABM is the Star 37E manufactured by Thiokol,\nwhich has a mass of 1122 kg, burns for 42 s and delivers an average thrust of 69 kN.\n\nClearly the emplacement roles of the solid propellant ABM, with its near-impulsive\n?V, and the bi-propellant MMH/N2O4, with the advantages of higher specific impulse\nand more controlled burning, are interchangeable. The impulsive burn requires that the\nspacecraft should also spin for reasons of gyroscopic stability and thrust alignment. It\nis therefore inherently less accurate than the extended burn, lower thrust level operation\nof the bi-propellant motor, which admits precise spacecraft attitude control throughout\nthe thrusting phase. The trade-off is again that of propulsion system complexity for\nimproved performance.\n\n6.4 ELECTRIC PROPULSION\n\nThe opening section of this chapter revealed some crucial differences in the performance\nand operation of separately powered rockets. Unlike the chemical systems which we\nhave described thus far, the energy required for expellant acceleration in an electrically\npropelled rocket derives from a quite separate source. Whether this source is solar radiation\nor nuclear fuel, it may be effectively unlimited and the constraints on performance relate\nto attainable thrust levels and efficient energy conversion.\n\nWhilst electric propulsion has been an active area of development since the earliest\nspace flights, it is only in relatively recent years that electric propulsion has regularly\nbeen adopted for commercial, scientific and military missions. Each of the technolo-\ngies described below have, however, now been operated in space; some as primary\nsystems, although some are still in the technology demonstration stage. In excess of\n100 commercial spacecraft, in orbit have adopted electric propulsion systems for either\nattitude, orbit control or orbit raising. Missions like the Deep Space 1 probe, launched\nin October 1998, and ESA\u2019s SMART-1 in 2003 have demonstrated the use of electric\npropulsion systems in fly-by manoeuvres beyond Earth orbit. The transfer of technology\nfrom the former Soviet Union under the joint National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-\ntration (NASA)/Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) RHETT programme in\n\n\n\nELECTRIC PROPULSION 6.4 207\n\nthe early 1990s has significantly contributed to the increased use of electric propulsion\ntechnologies generally. In the following sections we review the key features and the\nopportunities offered by adopting electric propulsion on a vehicle, together with a brief\ndescription and performance available from individual systems.\n\n6.4.1 Electric propulsion fundamentals\n\nIn view of the importance of the power-plant to the rocket configuration, it is convenient\nto analyse the performance in terms of the component masses: Mw , the power-plant mass;\nMe , the expellant mass; and Mp , the payload mass. The expellant storage and feed system\nmay be assumed to be part of the power-plant, whilst the power-plant fuel mass will be\nconsidered to be negligibly small (nuclear fuel) or inappropriate (solar powered). The\nconfiguration envisaged is shown schematically in Figure 6.23.\n\nThe power-plant supplies the exhaust kinetic energy whence the jet power is related to\nthe exhaust velocity by an expression of the form,\n\nW = 1/2 m?V 2e (6.25)\n\nwhere W denotes power-plant output, m?the expellant mass flow rate and Ve the exhaust\nvelocity (if thruster process losses are introduced, then Wjet = ?W , but for present pur-\nposes we suppose ? = 1).\n\nWe relate the power output W to the power-plant mass Mw linearly and introduce the\ninverse specific power ?such that\n\nMw = ?W (6.26)\n\nIf we suppose the exhaust mass flow rate to be constant throughout the burn time, tb ,\nsuch that\n\nm? = Me/tb (6.27)\n\nPayload, Mp\n\nExhaust velocity, Ve\n\nPower\nplant, Mw\n\nExpellant\n Me\n\nThrust\n= ? MVe\n\nAccelerator\n\n\u2022\n\nFigure 6.23 Schematic for a separately powered rocket\n\n\n\n208 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nthen\n\nMe = M0 ? Mp\n1 +\n\n(\nV 2e /\n\n2tb\n?\n\n) (6.28)\n\nand\n\nMw = M0 ? Mp\n1 +\n\n(\n2tb\n?\n\n/V 2e\n) , (6.29)\n\nwhere M0 = Mp + Mw + Me is the total rocket mass.\nBy identifying\n\n?\n(2tb/?) as the characteristic velocity Vc and using the above relation-\n\nships in the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation (6.5) it can be shown that\n\n?V\n\nVe\n= In\n\n?\n? 1 + (Ve/Vc)2\n\nMp\nM0\n\n+ (Ve/Vc)2\n\n?\n? (6.30)\n\nThe rocket performance described by equation (6.30) is illustrated in Figure 6.24. For\nVe/Vc \n 1, increases in exhaust velocity at fixed characteristic velocity result in larger\navailable propulsive ?V . Such behaviour is essentially that observed with chemical\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0.01 0.1 1\n\nVe /Vc\n\nMp/Mo = 0\n\n0.1\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n?V\n/V\n\nc\n\n10\n\nFigure 6.24 Separately powered electric rocket performance\n\n\n\nELECTRIC PROPULSION 6.4 209\n\npropellants. Performance improvements accompany the better propellant utilization\nreflected in higher exhaust velocities. Unlike chemical propulsion, however, such benefits\ndo not extend without limit and for Ve/Vc ? 1, the?V passes through a maximum and\nthen decreases. Further increases in exhaust velocity require higher powers (see equation\n6.25) and therefore increased power-plant mass (see equation 6.26). Beyond a certain\nstage these increases in power-plant mass outweigh the further reductions in expellant\nmass accompanying the higher exhaust velocities.\n\nThe presence of maxima in Figure 6.24 introduces a range of optimization studies.\nFor a particular payload ratio, Mp/M0, it is desirable to operate in the vicinity of the\nmaximum, broadly corresponding to Ve/Vc ? 1, so that the high exhaust velocity then\nrequires 2tb/? ? 1. Optimized electric propulsion usage will thus tend to imply lengthy\nburn times and small inverse specific power, ?.\n\nConsider the following illustration of a payload ratio Mp/M0 = 0.5, a mission ?V of,\nsay 5 km s?1, representative of an orbit-raising manoeuvre, and\n\nVc ? Ve ? 16 km s?1\n\nFor ? = 20 kg/kW, representative of modern lightweight solar arrays, the burn time\ntb would be 30 days. The mean acceleration over the thrust duration, ?V /tb , is then\n2 \u00d7 10?4g0. Clearly quite spectacular improvements in ? would be necessary for such\npropulsion systems to operate from planetary surfaces. However it is quite clear that if\nlong burn times are acceptable from a mission perspective then, according to Figure 6.24,\nsubstantial mass savings may be achievable. Generally, operational limitations for sta-\ntion keeping of GEO spacecraft do not include a constraint upon long duration thrust\narcs. While there may be radiation induced system problems for substantial orbit raising\nmanoeuvres for commercial satellites through the Van Allen radiation belts, these may be\novercome using transfers adopting a super-synchronous orbit having a high perigee (for\nexample ?20 000 km has been used by Boeing). It is therefore clear that many Earth orbit\napplications may benefit from electric propulsion. Originally however it was the opportu-\nnity presented by the high specific impulse from some types of devices, particularly the\nion engine variants, which encouraged the earliest reviews (for example [19]), to focus\nupon the adoption of electric propulsion for interplanetary missions. We explore these\naspects in the following section.\n\n6.4.2 Propulsive roles for electric rockets\n\nIf we recall that thrust acceleration levels of 2 \u00d7 10?4g0 are equivalent to approximately\n0.35 \u00d7 solar gravitational acceleration at 1 AU, then continuous thrust at these levels has\na pronounced influence on interplanetary trajectories. Substantial mass savings have been\ndemonstrated to be available for many interplanetary missions, should they adopt elec-\ntric propulsion. It is perhaps therefore not surprising that papers still regularly appear in\njournals such as Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets , which contribute to the analysis of\nmissions to Solar System bodies. The use of a gridded ion engine on the BepiColombo\nmission to Mercury, one of ESA\u2019s cornerstone missions due for launch in 2014, is a clear\nstatement of the maturity of electric propulsion in such high profile missions. Many mis-\nsion scenarios have been defined, not only to Mars, but also to the other major and minor\nplanets [20, 21]. The performance of electric propulsion systems during interplanetary\n\n\n\n210 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nmissions has been demonstrated following the success of the Deep Space 1 mission [22]\nand the ongoing mission to the Itokawa asteroid, with the Hayabusa spacecraft now on an\nEarth-return trajectory [23] (at the time of writing\u20142010). To date, however, the majority\nof satellites have employed electric propulsion for either station-keeping, orbit control,\nEarth orbit raising or attitude control.\n\nSubstantial benefits in terms of payload into final orbit may be achieved if the potential\nof high exhaust velocities to reduce propellant mass can be realized. Recalling Figure 6.24,\nthe maxima are distinguished by Ve/Vc ? 1 and therefore high exhaust velocity must\naccompany extensive burn times, V 2c = 2tb/?. Figure 6.25 presents a simple comparison\nbetween a two-impulse Hohmann transfer and low-thrust orbit raising from low Earth\norbit, radius r0, to a higher orbit, radius r . The electric rocket is typically fired con-\ntinuously and near-circumferential low-thrust leads to a gradual spiralling expansion of\nthe orbit radius. Projected burn times of months would probably be acceptable opera-\ntionally for an unmanned space tug, implying a modest extension of launch procurement\nschedules. The implications for thruster design are more important. Extended burn times\ndo influence the propulsive ?V required and low-thrust orbit-raising operations will in\ngeneral require a larger?V . Figure 6.26 compares the impulsive and circumferential low-\nthrust requirements; transfer to geostationary orbit requires approximately 20% more ?V\nfor the low-thrust mission. The requirements of accompanying manoeuvres for low-thrust\norbital operations such as changes in orbit inclination were originally extensively analysed\nby Burt [24].\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n1 2 4\n\nRadial  position, r/ro\n\n6 8\n\nGeostationary\nheight\n\nLow-thrust orbit\nraising\n\nHohmann two-impulse\ntransfer.\n\nP\nay\n\nlo\nad\n\n r\nat\n\nio\n, M\n\np\n/M\n\n0\n\na = 10 kg/kW, tb = 100 days\n\na = 20 kg/kW, tb = 50 days\n\nve = 16 km s\n?1\n\nve = 8 km s\n?1\n\ns = 0.1, ve = 4 km s\n?1\n\nFigure 6.25 Comparative performance: chemical impulse versus low-thrust orbital\ntransfer\n\n\n\nELECTRIC PROPULSION 6.4 211\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nRadial position, r /r0\n\nTwo-impulse hohmann\n\nGeostationary\n\nConstant circumferential\nlow thrust\n\n= 1 ? r0r\n?V\nV0\n\n1\n2\n\n?V V\n0\n\nFigure 6.26 Comparative ?V requirement for transfer between circular orbits r0 to r\n\nThe relationship noted in Figure 6.24 between characteristic mission impulse ?V, the\ncharacteristic velocity Vc and the exhaust gas velocity Ve identifies that the type of electric\npropulsion technology selected for a mission will depend upon the mission itself. In part\nthis demonstrates why in the early years of spaceflight, research was directed to those\ntechnologies capable of achieving the highest specific impulse, especially electrostatic and\nelectromagnetic engines.\n\nAs an example, for either typical Earth orbit raising in which the ratio of initial to\nfinal orbit is close to unity, or for N/S station keeping in GEO, magneto-plasma dynamic\n(MPD) and thermal arc jets demonstrate optimum performance [25]. Alternatively for\ninterplanetary trajectories, electrostatic ion engines offer good performance. As noted,\nhowever, in [25] care has to be taken in the definition of system performance, specifically\nwhether the satellite power system is sized for the propulsion module or for the operational\npayload or for other on-board subsystems, since this can have an important influence on\nthe selected \u2018optimum\u2019 technology.\n\nHowever, optimum performance is only one issue to be addressed in technology\nselection. More important is the issue of technology availability. In this respect, some\ntechnologies offering more modest, sub-optimum improvements in specific impulse have\nbeen developed more rapidly than those with greater potential for mass saving. Thus to\ndate most electric propulsion systems which have been flown are of the resistojet type.\nHence for Motorola\u2019s original Iridium constellation, Primex Aerospace\u2019s hydrazine resis-\ntojets having an ISP of order 300 s, were used for orbit raising to the operational altitude\n\n\n\n212 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nof 780 km. Resistojets at much lower ISP ? 50 s, have also been developed for small\nsatellites, where available power is very low [26].\n\nAlthough practical application has thus far tended to favour resistojets having these\nmore modest specific impulses, there are now a number of well developed and commer-\ncially available gridded ion, Hall effect and MPD engines, all principally using xenon as\nthe propellant of choice.\n\n6.4.3 Electric propulsion systems\n\nThe basic principles underlying electric thruster design are well established (see for\nexample Stu?hlinger [27], Jahn [28], and Sutton and Biblarz [6]). Electrically powered\nexpellant acceleration devices are of essentially three types: electrothermal , in which the\nenthalpy of the expellant is increased and converted into directed kinetic energy via a\nnozzle; electrostatic, in which charged particles, ions or colloids, are accelerated directly\nin an electric field; and electrodynamic, in which crossed electric and magnetic fields\ninduce a Lorentz force in a plasma. We illustrate briefly designs reflecting each of these\ndistinctive approaches.\n\nElectrothermal thrusters\n\nThe resistojet is the simplest electrothermal thruster. Typically, the propellant is heated\nby passing it over a tungsten heating element. Broad features of the thruster are sketched\nin Figure 6.27. The more common propellants are hydrogen, nitrogen, ammonia and,\nin decomposition thrusters in incorporating electrical heating and chemical heat release,\nhydrazine (power-augmented hydrazine thrusters (PAEHT)). The exhaust velocity is\na function of temperature, and therefore materials\u2019 integrity and life considerations\nlimit Ve to about 10 km s?1. Efficiencies in excess of 70% and thrust levels ? 0.5N\nhave been demonstrated. Hydrogen is particularly attractive as a propellant since it is\n\nPropellant\nstorage\n\nPower\nsupply\n\nPropellant\npump\n\nPropellant\ninlet\n\nThermal insulation\n\nTungsten\nheating\nelement\n\nNozzle\nefflux\n\nFigure 6.27 The simplest electrothermal thruster: the resistojet\n\n\n\nELECTRIC PROPULSION 6.4 213\n\nnon-corrosive, with both high specific heat and thermal conductivity. It is, however,\ndifficult to store, requiring cryogenic temperatures, and dissociation to atomic hydrogen\nat elevated temperature leads to frozen flow losses in the nozzle.\n\nAmmonia is readily stored without refrigeration and is dissociated to lighter species\non heating, but it is corrosive in both the heater and nozzle. Higher specific impulses are\navailable from the arc jet (?2000 s) but at reduced electrical efficiency. The expellant itself\nis subject to ohmic heating by passing it through an arc discharge, thereby eliminating\ngas-solid heat transfer. For many years the principal problem in the implementation of\narc jet technology arose from the high erosion of the cathode material. This erosion is\na function of both the propellant and the thruster configuration. These propulsion units\nare, however, intrinsically simple systems and it is a relatively easy matter to convert the\non-board available voltage of most spacecraft buses, to the typical 100 V required for an\narc jet. Hydrazine fuelled systems are now space proven, and are being used operationally\non many satellites. Performance figures quoted by manufacturers identify an ISP greater\nthan 500 s and a thrust greater than 100 mN for an input power of order 1\u20132 kW.\n\nElectrostatic thrusters\n\nElectrostatic thrusters derive their thrust from the direct acceleration of positively charged\nparticles in a static electric field. The stream of positively charged particles must be neu-\ntralized to avoid a charge, opposite to that carried away from the spacecraft in the beam,\nwhich would lead eventually to stalling of the thruster. Neutralization is generally achieved\nby a hot cathode electron source, placed in near proximity to the thruster exit plane.\n\nA one-dimensional approximation to the underlying performance of an electrostatic\nthruster is simply obtained by equating the potential energy of the ion, as it leaves the\nionization region in the thruster, to the kinetic energy it has achieved moving through\nthe electrostatic field. Thus assuming a charge of q (coulombs) exists on an ion of mass\nmi (kg), and the potential applied between the ion source and the exit plane of the final\naccelerator grid is V (volts), then:\n\n1\n\n2\nmi v\n\n2 = qV .\n\nIf it is assumed that the conversion efficiency from the electrical power plant output to\nkinetic energy in the ion stream is unity, then the thrust to power ratio for such a thruster\nis then simply:\n\nF\n\nW\n=\n\n?\n2mi /q\n\nV\n(6.31)\n\nThus for a given electrical power and hence power plant mass (equation 6.26), the thrust\nis maximized for large mass to charge ratio (mi /q). Development of these thrusters is\nnow based exclusively upon either argon mi /q ? 4 \u00d7 10?7 or xenon mi/q ? 1.4 \u00d7 10?6\nas a propellant; for each of these mi /q values it is assumed that a single charge only is\nheld on the ion. Each of these propellants has been used in thrusters based upon electron\nbombardment for the production of ions, originally called the Kaufmann engine, but now\nmore commonly referred to as a Gridded Ion Engine. In an electron bombardment ion\nsource, the electrons are emitted from an axially mounted thermionic cathode where they\n\n\n\n214 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nare attracted towards a concentric cylindrical anode. A weak, externally applied magnetic\nfield causes the electrons to spiral within the chamber and propellant ionization results\nfrom collisions between these electrons and propellant vapour. A representative small\nthruster design for station-keeping is illustrated in Figure 6.28.\n\nSignificant mass savings have been predicted to accompany the application of such ion\npropulsion to N/S station-keeping for geostationary spacecraft\u2014for example, in relation\nto the 25 mN UK-10 xenon thruster on Intelsat spacecraft [29].\n\nThe first use of a xenon ion engine in space was the RITA engine on the ESA Eureca-1\nmission in 1992. Since then there has been a steadily increasing adoption of ion engines for\nNSSK on GEO spacecraft. The PanAmSat organization was the first to have an operational\nion engine for one of its satellites PAS-5, which was launched in 1997. This ion engine,\nsimilar to one used on most subsequent flights, is the Boeing (formerly Hughes Space and\nCommunications) company\u2019s \u2018XIPS\u2019 propulsion unit . Two variants of the thruster have\nbeen flown, one having a 13 cm diameter capable of a thrust of 18 mN at an ISP of 2568 s,\nthe other with a diameter of 25 cm, with a thrust of 165 mN and an ISP of 3800 s. The\nsmaller unit has been used on several commercial communications and broadcast satellites\nincluding Astra 2A in 1998 for NSSK. In these missions the thrusters are required to fire\nfor approximately 5 h per day in order to maintain the satellite on station. The larger unit\nwas used on the Deep Space 1 mission.\n\nAn alternative form of ion thruster is based upon the extraction of charged fluid droplets\ndirectly from a fluid surface. Two forms of this exist: field emission electric propulsion\n(FEEP) [30], and colloid propulsion [31]. Both of these depend upon the formation of a\n\u2018Taylor cone\u2019 [32] at the surface of a fluid that is subject to a strong electric field. The\nfluid cone forms a capillary jet at its apex that breaks up into a fine spray of positively\ncharged droplets. These droplets in the case of FEEP are sub-nanometre in size, whereas\nfor colloid systems they are sub-micron in size. The colloid droplets, having significantly\nlarger masses than those for the corresponding Kaufmann ion sources, are able to produce\na higher thrust density, but at the expense of lower ISP .\n\nApplications for both nanosatellite and microsatellite applications have led to devel-\nopment activities towards a fully integrated micropropulsion unit with many components\nmanufactured using MEMS technology (see also Chapter 18). One favoured solution for\nthis is the colloid thruster. An example of this is capable of providing an ISP of up to\n3500 s at a thrust of 140 ?N with a complete system dry mass of less than 0.14 kg, includ-\ning the power control unit [33]. This system has the potential to deliver a nanosatellite\ninto lunar orbit with a fuel load of ?0.25 kg.\n\nThe fluid in a FEEP thruster is a metal, frequently indium or caesium, which is heated\nso that it becomes liquid. In a colloid system, the fluid is an electrolyte of high electri-\ncal conductivity. FEEP thrusters have been developed principally in Europe. Since it is\nbelieved that FEEP can produce a highly stable low-thrust beam having a continuous thrust\nlevel of order 10 ?N, they have been identified to provide the capability of fine control\nfor several demanding missions which require perturbation-free operation. This thruster is\ncurrently the baseline for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna - LISA - a gravitational\nwave detector which is one of ESA\u2019s cornerstone missions, which requires a positional\ncontrol of order 10 nm. In this mission the thrust must be controlled smoothly in the range\n5\u201325 ?N with a control resolution of 0.1 ?N. The FEEP thruster being developed has an\nISP in the range 4000\u20136000 s. High electrical efficiency is obtained with a value greater\nthan 95%. The power to thrust ratio is of order 60 W/mN.\n\n\n\nELECTRIC PROPULSION 6.4 215\n\nC\nou\n\npl\nin\n\ng\npl\n\nas\nm\n\na\n\nS\ncr\n\nee\nn\n\ngr\nid\n\nIo\nn\n\nB\naf\n\nfle\n\nM\nai\n\nn\nflo\n\nw\ndi\n\nst\nrib\n\nut\nor\n\nIn\nsu\n\nla\nto\n\nrs\n\nF\ner\n\nro\nm\n\nag\nne\n\ntic\nci\n\nrc\nui\n\nt\n\nP\nla\n\nsm\na\n\nM\nag\n\nne\ntic\n\nfie\nld\n\n li\nne\n\nE\nle\n\nct\nro\n\nn \npa\n\nth\ns\n\nP\nos\n\niti\non\n\n o\nf m\n\nai\nn \n\nsu\npp\n\nor\nt\n\nin\nsu\n\nla\nto\n\nrs\n\nB\nac\n\nkp\nla\n\nte\n\nIs\nol\n\nat\nor\n\nP\nro\n\npe\nlla\n\nnt\nH\n\nol\nlo\n\nw\nca\n\nth\nod\n\ne\n\nIs\nol\n\nat\nor\n\nC\nat\n\nho\nde\n\nsu\npp\n\nor\nt\n\nIn\nne\n\nr\npo\n\nle D\nis\n\nch\nar\n\nge\nch\n\nam\nbe\n\nr\n\nE\nar\n\nth\ned\n\nsc\nre\n\nen\nP\n\nro\npe\n\nlla\nnt\n\nIn\nsu\n\nla\nto\n\nr\nne\n\nut\nra\n\nlis\ner\n\nC\nat\n\nho\nde\n\nas\nse\n\nm\nbl\n\ny\n\nA\nno\n\nde\n\nK\nee\n\npe\nr\n\nD\nec\n\nel\n g\n\nrid\n\nA\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nor\n\ngr\nid\n\nO\nut\n\ner\n p\n\nol\ne\n\nIo\nn\n\nB\nea\n\nm\n\nM\nai\n\nn \ndi\n\nsc\nha\n\nrg\ne\n\npl\nas\n\nm\na\n\nN\neu\n\ntr\nal\n\nis\nin\n\ng\nel\n\nec\ntr\n\non\ns\n\nS\nol\n\nen\noi\n\nd (a\n)\n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n6\n.2\n\n8\nA\n\nty\np\n\nic\nal\n\nio\nn\n\nth\nru\n\nst\ner\n\n\n\n216 PROPULSION SYSTEMS\n\nM\nas\n\ns \nflo\n\nw\n r\n\neg\nul\n\nat\nor\n\nE\nle\n\nct\nro\n\nni\ncs\n\n a\nnd\n\nV\nal\n\nve\n d\n\nriv\ner\n\ns\n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nte\n\nr \nco\n\nnt\nro\n\nl e\nle\n\nct\nro\n\nni\ncs\n\nan\nd \n\npo\nw\n\ner\n s\n\nup\npl\n\nie\ns\n\nO\nn/\n\nof\nf\n\npr\not\n\nec\ntio\n\nn\nS\n\neq\nue\n\nnc\ner\n\nTe\nle\n\nm\net\n\nry\nco\n\nnd\niti\n\non\nin\n\ng\n\nP\now\n\ner\n in\n\nC\nom\n\nm\nan\n\nds\nfr\n\nom\nda\n\nta\nbu\n\ns\n\nTe\nle\n\nm\net\n\nry\nou\n\nt\n\nS\nec\n\non\nd \n\nid\nen\n\ntic\nal\n\n io\nn \n\nth\nru\n\nst\ner\n\n a\nss\n\ny.\n\nP\nC\n\nC\nE\n\nN\neu\n\ntr\nal\n\nis\ner\n\nG\nrid\n\ns\nK\n\nee\npe\n\nr\n\nA\nno\n\nde\n\nM\nag\n\nne\nt\n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nte\n\nr\n\nM\nai\n\nn \nflo\n\nw\n\nC\nat\n\nho\nde\n\nP\nS\n\nM\nE\n\nS\nta\n\nrt\nva\n\nlv\nes\n\nO\nrif\n\nic\nes\n\nR\neg\n\nul\nat\n\nor\nva\n\nlv\nes\n\nP\nle\n\nnu\nm\n\ns\nLa\n\ntc\nh\n\nva\nlv\n\ne\n\nP\nle\n\nnu\nm\n\nLo\nw\n\n p\nre\n\nss\n tr\n\nan\ns\n\nR\neg\n\nul\nat\n\nor\nva\n\nlv\nes\n\nH\nP\n\nT\n\nS\nto\n\nra\nge\n\n ta\nnk\n\nF\n/V\n\n v\nal\n\nve\n\nR\n/v\n\nal\nve\n\nP\nS\n\nE\n\nG\nas\n\nin\nle\n\nt\n\n(b\n)\n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n6\n.2\n\n8\nC\n\no\nn\n\nti\nn\n\nu\ned\n\n\n\nREFERENCES 217\n\nHybrid thrusters\n\nSeveral thrusters rely upon the interaction between electric and magnetic fields for their\nability to produce high ISP thrust. Historically in the West, considerable research emphasis\nwas placed upon the magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) arc jet . In the former Soviet Union,\npractical thrusters were produced which utilize the Hall Effect.\n\nAs noted above, Hall Effect thrusters have been the subject of a successful technology\ntransfer programme to the USA. This has resulted in commercially available thrusters\nwhich have been adopted for several satellites. In the Hall thruster an externally provided\nradial magnetic field is required. Within the volume enclosed by this field a continuous\naxial electric discharge is maintained in the low pressure xenon propellant gas. The inter-\naction between the axial and radial fields generates a Hall current, perpendicular to the\nelectric field, which is azimuthal within the volume of the thruster. It is this Hall current\nwhich interacts with the magnetic field that is responsible for the axial acceleration of\nthe propellant. Performance is dependent upon the size of the thruster. The T-220 system\ndeveloped by NASA has a thrust of 500 mN at a specific impulse of 2450 s. The input\npower for this performance is 10 kW, with an overall electrical efficiency of 59%. Smaller\nsystems have also been flown, with a power input of 1.35 kW for attitude control, and on\nthe STEX spacecraft in 1998, for orbit raising.\n\nThe magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) arc jet evolved from the combination of elec-\ntrothermal arc jet and magnetogasdynamic technologies. A neutral plasma is accelerated\nby means of both Joule heating and electrodynamic forces. In the full MPD engine, the\nself-induced magnetic field provides the dominant acceleration mechanism, with thrust\nbeing proportional to the current squared. At low power levels the propulsive efficiency\nis somewhat modest (?10% for a 1 kW device [34]). As the power level increases into\nthe megawatt range, significantly improved efficiencies result (?40% at ?MW [35]). For\nsuch high power levels, a pulsed operation is essential and significant developments have\ntaken place in Japan in this area, including flight experiments. As with electrothermal\narc jets, at present the major life limitation for these devices is due to cathode erosion.\nTypical operational characteristics are thrusts of a few newtons, with an Isp ? 2000 s.\n\nThrusters using Teflon as a solid propellant have also been developed, and generally go\nunder the heading of pulse plasma thrusters (PPT), and are a variant of the MPD thruster.\nThese again rely upon the interaction of an electric field with a self-induced magnetic\nfield. A capacitor is used to initiate a pulse discharge in between two electrodes separated\nin part by a Teflon bar. The surface of this bar ablates, because of the heating caused by\nthe discharge. The induced magnetic field from the high current pulse discharge acts in\nsimilar manner to the MPD, to accelerate the ablated material. A very high thrust pulse\nlasting for some tens of milliseconds can be produced in these thrusters, with a peak\nthrust value in the region of several hundred newtons. These thrusters have been flown\non several missions, particularly for station keeping. Specific impulse from these thrusters\nis similar to that available from Hall Thrusters.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Friedman, L. et al.

The extent to which the user of launch vehicle services\nis able, in turn, to influence launcher development is, however, still largely unresolved.\n\nOf particular concern to the user, in relation to spacecraft design, are the constraints\nthat the launcher imposes on the mission. These arise especially in terms of payload mass\nand size, but also include the selection of launch sites and launch windows, the launch\nenvironment (mechanical and electrical\u2014see Chapters 2 and 8) as well as issues of safety\nand reliability (see Chapter 19).\n\nIn this chapter, we seek first to establish the basic principles that determine launch\nvehicle design and performance and, in so doing, constrain payload and mission. Secondly,\nwe outline the key features of the principal launch vehicle alternatives, as featured in\nEurope and the United States - notably Ariane 5 and Ares 1 - together with the growing\nrange of smaller vehicles. We address briefly some of the key concerns of the user\ncommunity in relation to launch costs, operational flexibility and reliability, ending with\nsome speculation about future launch capability.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

A more comprehensive three-dimensional description of these equations is\nprovided by Vinh [1].\n\nThe configuration envisaged and the accompanying nomenclature are shown in\nFigure 7.1.

We note that the impulse requirement (minimum burn time) that might lead\nto reduced gravity loss is at variance with the requirement from the standpoint of drag\nloss, which might suggest a low velocity ascent through the denser atmosphere since\nD = 12?V 2SCD . This latter requirement is broadly satisfied. The first stage propulsion of\na multi-stage vehicle might typically have an initial thrust-to-weight ratio less than about\n1.5, implying an initial vertical acceleration of about 0.5 g0.\n\nVehicles are generally launched vertically and minimization of gravity loss, together\nwith the eventual requirement of locally horizontal payload injection, suggests that\n\n\n\n224 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\nIdeal Ignition Cut-out\n\nIdeal\nvelocity\n\nActual\nflight\nvelocity\n\nV\n/V\n\nid\nea\n\nl\n\n(Drag loss)\n\n(Gravity loss)\n\n(Available for\nacceleration)\n\nID\n\nIG\n\nI\n\nIm\npu\n\nls\ne \n\n(%\n o\n\nf t\not\n\nal\n)\n\nFigure 7.2 Illustration of launch losses due to drag and gravity\n\nthe flight trajectory be deflected from the vertical as rapidly as possible.

Figure 7.3 illustrates the full range of flight parameters for a\ntypical injection into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The local pitch angle decreases\nby 60\n\n?\nin approximately the first two minutes of flight.\n\nExact analytical trajectory solutions are not available in general since thrust, gravity and\ndrag are complex functions of altitude. However, approximate analytical expressions can\nbe derived when further simplifying assumptions are introduced [2, 3]. In particular, when\ndrag and the variation in g are ignored, and the thrust-to-weight ratio is held constant at\nthe initial lift-off value, a = F/Mg = F0/M0g0, the mass ratio of a single-stage vehicle\nis given by [3],\n\nMb\nM0\n\n= exp\n{\n?

From the user\u2019s standpoint, this\nhelps to explain why the payload has to be designed to withstand final accelerations of\nabout 3\u20134 g0, although it should be noted many launch vehicles suffer from higher end-\nof-burn accelerations resulting from design limitations on engine shut-down conditions\nand/or the inability to throttle-back.\n\nWhen the contribution of aerodynamic drag is introduced, lower accelerations are\nrequired to minimize the peak aerodynamic pressures reached in the early phases of\nlaunch. Typically the drag coefficient CD will be highest in the transonic region and the\nlargest drag losses will occur in the low supersonic region of flight. The actual magnitude\nof the drag loss will be dependent on the vehicle\u2019s aerodynamic reference area S , which\nis dependent on the vehicle\u2019s size\u2014in particular the payload shroud dimensions. For a\nset of geometrically similar vehicles, the aerodynamic reference area will be proportional\nto M 2/3 and the drag loss ?VD will be proportional to M ?1/3 assuming CD is roughly\ninvariant. Consequently, for small vehicles launching small payloads, drag losses become\nrelatively more important and the user is often forced to accept tighter constraints on pay-\nload external dimensions. In general larger vehicles are able to achieve higher payload\nfractions since they have lower drag losses.\n\nAt this point it is appropriate to review some representative mission requirements for\nspacecraft launches.\n\n\n\n226 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\n?Va\n\nRE + h\n\nRE + h0 RE\n\nBurn-out\nvelocity,Vb\n\nThrusting\nphase\n\nTransfer orbit\napogee height\n\n(km)\n\nBurn-out\nvelocity at\n200 km, Vb\n\n(km s?1)\n\nCircularization\nburn at\n\napogee, ?Va\n(km s?1)\n\n   200\n   500\n1 000\n\n10 000\n35 863\n\n  7.784 = V0\n  7.870\n  8.004\n  9.299\n10.261\n11.009\n\n0\n0.085\n0.214\n1.199\n1.477\n?\n\n?Va = V0 1 ? 1 +\n\n1 +\n\n,\n\n2\nRE + h0\nRE + h\n\nBallistic\ncoast\n\nNon-rotating\nearth\n\nRE + h\nRE + h0\n\n1/2\n\nV0 = \nm\n\nRE + h0\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nVb = V0 ,\n\n2\n\nRE + h0\nRE + h\n\n1/2\n\n?\n\nFigure 7.4 Launch vehicle burn-out velocities for spacecraft emplacement\n\n7.2.2 Mission requirements\n\nThe standard launch vehicle must provide an efficient means of boosting a spacecraft into\nthe planned trajectory. The payloads may vary from those of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) sci-\nentific satellites, through geostationary communications satellites, to Earth escape probes.\nFigure 7.4 distinguishes some representative launch vehicle burn-out conditions for space-\ncraft emplacement. As the table of values shows, the minimum velocity at a typical\ninjection height of 200 km is approximately 7.8 km s?1, whilst that for a geostationary\ntransfer orbit must be 10.3 km s?1 (see also Section 5.2 of Chapter 5).\n\nIn addition to accelerating the payload to these velocities, the launch vehicle must\novercome the effects of aerodynamic drag and gravity. From equation (7.7)\n\n?Videal = ?V + ?Vg + ?VD\n\nand while detailed determination of the loss terms requires computation, estimates can be\nmade for purposes of preliminary planning using such correlations as those described by\nWhite [4]. Representative losses for the first stage of a large rocket using this approach are\n\n?Vg = 1.1 km s?1\n\n?VD = 0.2 km s?1\n\nThe values quoted in Figure 7.4 embody a significant simplification to do with Earth\nrotation. The rotational velocity at the Equator is approximately 0.47 km s?1, and an\neastward launch from the Earth\u2019s surface can capitalize on this velocity. The benefit\nreduces with increasing latitude of the launch site and vanishes completely for launches\ninto polar orbit.\n\n\n\nBASIC LAUNCH VEHICLE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATION 7.2 227\n\nLocal horizontal\n\nEastward\ninjection\n\nLatitude\n\nLaunch\nsite\n\nf\n\nFigure 7.5 Illustration of the link between orbit inclination and the latitude of the\nlaunch site\n\nThe latitude of the launch site also has important implications for the subsequent incli-\nnation of the spacecraft orbit. We have identified some significant benefits in respect\nof launcher performance accompanying both rapid pitch angle reduction and eastward\ninjection. Figure 7.5 illustrates a typical launch sequence. The spacecraft orbit plane is\nessentially fixed by the velocity vector at burn-out and, from gravitational considerations,\nthe centre of the Earth. Without a very lengthy \u2018dog-leg\u2019 manoeuvre prior to insertion,\naccompanied by increased losses, both gravitational and aerodynamic, the inclination of\nthe resulting orbit will then be approximately equal to the latitude of the launch site.\n\nAs we described in Chapter 5, the correct orbit inclination is a crucial orbital parameter.\nIn the case of the 24-hour synchronous communications satellite, for example, the sub-\nsatellite point is only stationary relative to the Earth for equatorial orbits. Inclination leads\nto the subsatellite point describing a closed figure of eight as illustrated in Figure 7.6 (see\nalso Section 5.6 of Chapter 5).

The control of orbit inclination, and\nspecifically its reduction to zero in the case of geostationary communications satellites,\nis a further requirement of the launch phase.\n\nTwo guiding principles behind thrusting operations have been identified in Section 3.2.5\nof Chapter 3 (see Figure 3.8). The maximum increase in vehicle speed, and hence kinetic\nenergy, is clearly obtained by thrusting in the direction of motion, and the thrust is\nthen used to best effect in orbit expansion. On the other hand, the maximum deviation\nfrom the initial direction is obtained if the available increment ?V is applied at right\nangles to the required direction. Furthermore, the smaller the initial velocity, the larger\nis the deviation for a prescribed level of ?V . Relative to the problem of orbit raising\nillustrated in Figure 7.4, directional changes are evidently most economically effected at\napogee when orbital speeds are least; for example, 3.07 km s?1 at geostationary altitude of\n36 000 km compared with 7.8 km s?1 at 200 km altitude.\n\nWe shall return to these discussions in later sections when reviewing some specific\napplications, but it is appropriate to note at this stage that the geographical position of\nthe launch site will have important mission implications.\n\n7.2.3 Multi-staged launch vehicles\n\nIt is evident from Figure 7.4 that the minimum burn-out velocity for orbital operations\nis approximately 7.8 km s?1. Linking this requirement with equation (7.6) and neglecting\ndrag and gravity losses, then from\n\nVb = ISP g0 ln R (7.9)\n\nwe may estimate the necessary rocket mass ratio R for a particular propellant combination,\nand hence the ISP . Suppose the initial rocket mass, M0, comprises three components,\npayload MP , structure MS and fuel MF , whence\n\nM0 = MP + MS + MF (7.10)\n\nIf we introduce the fractional payload ratio, p = MPM0 and the propellant tankage structural\nefficiency, ? = MSMF , then we may write\n\nR = MP + MS + MF\nMP + MS =\n\n1 + ?\np + ? (7.11)\n\nSubstituting equation (7.11) in equation (7.9) gives\n\nVb = ISP g0 ln{(1 + ?)/(p + ?)} (7.12)\n\nFor a typical structural efficiency, ? ? 0.1, then the maximum value of the mass ratio,\nR, corresponding to zero payload is approximately R = 11. Rearranging equation (7.12),\nfor given Vb\n\nISP =\n(\n\nVb\ng0\n\n)\nln{(p + ?)/(1 + ?)}\n\n\n\nBASIC LAUNCH VEHICLE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATION 7.2 229\n\nand for the maximum value R, together with the minimum burn-out velocity, this implies\n\nISP ? 331 s.\n\nThus, even under these ideal circumstances, single-stage-to-orbit could only be attained\nusing high energy propellant (see Chapter 6). If we incorporate a non-vanishing payload\nand make allowance for performance losses associated with gravity and aerodynamic drag,\nthen low Earth orbit is only marginally attainable with the most energetic fuel/oxidizer\ncombinations. Significant contributions, in respect of structural mass reductions, must also\ncome from the exploitation of novel lightweight materials.\n\nSince the mass of propellant tankage is large, significant performance benefits result\nfrom the progressive shedding of this mass by multi-staging. In these circumstances, only\na small fraction of the initial tankage mass is accelerated to the final speed.\n\nIf we identify the operation of each stage by an equation of the form given in (7.12),\ndistinguishing the i th stage by subscript, then the velocity increment produced is\n\n?Vi = Vb,i ? Vb,i?1 = ISP ,i g0 ln{(1 + ?i )/(pi + ?i )} (7.13)\n\nWe observe that the payload for the i th?stage comprises the vehicle hardware (including\nthe satellite(s) to be launched) \u2018above\u2019 the i th stage. Summing over n such stages, the\nfinal burn-out velocity is then given by\n\nVb =\nn?\n\ni=1\nISP ,i g0 ln{(1 + ?i )/(pi + ?i )} (7.14)\n\nAn elaborate optimization procedure is required if we seek, for example, to maximize this\nvelocity subject to constraints imposed by way of payload ratio and rocket performance.\nWe should recall that the lower stages will also be subject to drag and gravity losses.\nThe generalized problem has been extensively analysed, for example, by White [4]. It is\nsufficient for purposes of illustration here to take the simplest case in which the stage\nspecific impulses and structural efficiencies are equal (?i = s), whence\n\nVb =\nn?\n\ni=1\nISP g0 ln{(1 + s)/(pi + s)}\n\nBy the use of the technique of Lagrange multipliers with the constraint imposed by\nspecification of the overall payload ratio,\n\nP =\nn?\n\ni=1\npi\n\nit can be shown that Vb is maximized when the stage payload ratios are all equal,\n\npi = P 1/n (all i) (7.15)\n\n\n\n230 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nand\n\nVb max = ISP g0\n{\n\nn ln(1 + s) ? n ln\n(\n\ns + P 1/n\n)}\n\nThis expression has the asymptotic value\n\nVb max ? ISP g0 ln P?1 as n ? ?. (7.16)\n\nThe benefits introduced by multi-staging therefore do not increase without bound except\nfor the impractical case of zero overall payload ratio, as shown in Figure 7.7. At the upper\nend of payload ratios of interest, P? 0.1, there is little advantage in further partitioning\nbeyond three stages, given the attendant increases in complexity and cost. The inclusion\nof the propulsive losses described earlier leads typically to a preferential loading of the\nfirst stage.\n\nBy way of illustration Figure 7.8 compares a staged vehicle with parameters based\non the air-launched Pegasus vehicle, produced by Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC),\nwith an equivalent single-stage vehicle having the same overall mass, payload ratio and\naverage stage properties (structure-fuel ratio and specific impulse). Table 7.1 summarizes\nsome of the key features of the propulsive performance of the Pegasus vehicle employed\nin the comparison.\n\nWhile the three-stage vehicle shows a substantial improvement over its single-stage\nequivalent, an available ?V of only 8.1 km s?1 would not normally be sufficient to\nsecure LEO once the drag and gravity losses are also incorporated. The vehicle\u2019s addi-\ntional performance is derived from the air launch\u2014which imparts an initial velocity\n(0.24 km s?1) and the diminished losses accompanying reduced air density and angle\nof incidence.\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 10\n\nNo. of stages, n\n\nP = .001\n\n.005\n\n.01\n\n.1\n\nAsymptotic values\nn\n\n?V\nI S\n\nP\n g\n\n0\n\n?\n\nFigure 7.7 Variation of velocity increment with number of stages for fixed overall\npayload ratio P\n\n\n\nSPACECRAFT LAUNCH PHASES AND MISSION PLANNING 7.3 231\n\n\u2022   Equivalent single-stage launcher ?V\n\n\u2022   Ideal three-stage launcher\n                    performance\n\n?V = 5.4 km s?1\n\n?V =\n\nPayload               455 kg\n\nStructural mass    2447 kg (s = 0.15)\n\nPropellant mass 15957 kg\n\nMass ratio             6.5\n\nfor an average Isp of 295s\n\n3rd stage payload     455 kg;\n\n2nd stage payload     1439 kg;\n\n1st stage payload     4839 kg;\n\nOverall payload ratio, P = ?pi = 0.025\n\np3 =\n455\n\n1439\n= 0.32\n\np2 =\n1439\n\n4839\n= 0.30\n\np1 =\n4839\n\n1 + si\npi + si\n\n18859\n= 0.26\n\n= 8.1 kms?1\n\ni\n\n?ISP,i g0 ln\ni\n\nFigure 7.8 Illustration of the benefits of multi-staging\n\n7.3 SPACECRAFT LAUNCH PHASES AND MISSION\n\nPLANNING\n\nIn the preceding sections, we have outlined some basic aspects of flight dynamics, the\npropulsive requirements for Earth orbit attainment and the response to the intrinsic mis-\nmatch between ?V and chemical propellant performance as reflected in multi-staging.\nSpacecraft missions invariably require the emplacement of the payload in an orbit having\nnarrowly specified parameters\u2014altitude, eccentricity, inclination and inertial orientation.\nThe launch phase therefore embraces each of the propulsive manoeuvres necessary to\nachieve the initial emplacement and these are necessarily different for each mission.\n\n\n\n232 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nTable 7.1 Propulsive characteristics: Pegasus launcher\n\nStage Specific impulse Average Burn Gross Propellant\nin vacuum [s] thrust [kN] time [s] mass [kg] [kg]\n\n1 295.3 486.7 77 14 020 12 150\n2 295.5 122.8 75 3400 3025\n3 291.1 54.56 65 984 782\n\n7.3.1 Geostationary orbit emplacement\n\nA typical three-stage expendable launcher injects the satellite into GTO with a perigee\nat 200 km altitude and apogee at 36 000 km (see also Section 5.6 of Chapter 5). Upper-\nstage burn-out occurs at the first equatorial plane crossing. Following a ballistic coast,\nthe transfer orbit apogee then coincides with the second crossing of the equatorial plane,\nor node. This transfer orbit is inclined, the inclination being dependent upon the latitude\nof the launch site and the launch azimuth. As indicated earlier, a due east launch (launch\nazimuth = 90?) will result in a transfer orbit inclination equal to the latitude of the launch\nsite, while any other launch azimuth must increase the orbit inclination.\n\nPositioning of the geostationary apogee over the equator admits the possibility of\nemplacement in final equatorial geostationary orbit by a further single motor firing. The\nsatellite is fitted with an apogee boost (or kick ) motor (ABM/AKM) specifically to effect\nthis combined manoeuvre of orbit circularization and inclination removal. The transfer\norbit apogee velocity is approximately 1.60 km s?1 while the equatorial geostationary\norbital velocity is 3.07 km s?1. Table 7.2 illustrates the impact of launch site latitude, and\nhence transfer orbit inclination, on ABM impulse requirement.\n\nNear-equatorial launch sites such as the European Space Agency site at Kourou in\nFrench Guiana (? 5? N) offer significant propulsive advantages over the Eastern Test\nRange [Kennedy Space Center (KSC)] in Florida (latitude ? 28? N) or the Japanese or\nRussian sites at even higher latitudes. The option to launch Soyuz rockets from Kourou\nfrom 2010 will exploit this advantage.\n\nInjection into the final orbit by the satellite ABM is not usually effected at the first\ntransfer orbit apogee, approximately five hours after launch. The manoeuvre is constrained\nby the requirement to attain the operational longitude station with a high level of accuracy\nand within a defined period. Precise determination of the satellite orbit and attitude by\nground station tracking is necessary in order to correctly orientate the motor prior to\ncommanding its firing. Several apogees will then pass\u2014the elliptical transfer orbit period\nis approximately 10 hours\u2014before the ABM burn. The satellite must be ground controlled\n\nTable 7.2 ABM impulse requirements for geostationary orbit emplacement\n\nTransfer orbit inclination (degrees)\n\n0 10 30 50\n\nABM ?V (km s?1) 1.47 1.52 1.86 2.38\n\n\n\nSPACECRAFT LAUNCH PHASES AND MISSION PLANNING 7.3 233\n\nApogee\n\n1\n2\n\nW E\n\n?f\n\nDrift orbit\n(period <24 hrs)\n\nGeostationary orbit\n(24 h)\n\n  1 = Subsatellite point\n        at insertion.\n  2 = Subsatellite point\n        one orbit later.   \n?f = Eastward drift of\n        subsatellite point\n         per satellite revolution\n\nFigure 7.9 Station acquisition from a drift orbit\n\nduring this phase and have sufficient electrical power to maintain communications and\nsome on-board systems, for example, attitude and orbit control. If this phase is solely\nbattery powered, then such factors will determine the acceptable length of time spent in\ntransfer orbit.\n\nIn view of the possible accumulation of injection errors and the requirement to position\nthe satellite precisely on longitude station, final positioning can be achieved from a drift\norbit. If the satellite orbit after ABM firing is arranged to be very slightly elliptical, with\nperigee somewhat less than geostationary height, then the orbit period will be slightly\nless than the Earth rotational period. Furthermore, as Figure 7.9 illustrates, the subsatellite\npoint at geostationary height will then drift gradually eastwards relative to the Earth. Short\nduration firing of the satellite\u2019s station-keeping thrusters over several days then permits\nthe precise positioning of the satellite. The use of liquid bi-propellants\u2014rather than\nsolid propellants\u2014in apogee motors [Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM)] offers an alternative\nstrategy for station acquisition involving more extended motor firings at lower thrust\nlevels that make less demands on the satellite ACS (see Section 5.6 of Chapter 5).\n\n7.3.2 Low Earth orbit emplacement\n\nSimilar, if less elaborate, manoeuvres apply to most other near-Earth missions. The more\nenergetic and accurate is the launch vehicle injection, the smaller is the secondary satellite\npropulsion requirement and the greater is the true payload fraction. Preliminary mission\nplanning is essentially iterative, however (see Chapter 5). The identification of broad\nmission objectives\u2014Earth observation, communications, science\u2014will all involve the\nspecification of the satellite orbit. Launch vehicle performance summaries that describe\nthe orbits accessible to a particular payload mass introduce the first constraint.

As might be expected, the payload\ncapability into circular orbits of increasing altitude but fixed inclination decreases steadily.\nFurther reductions accompany the raising of the apogee height. Changes in inclination\nalso have a substantial impact on payload capability. If the 500 km orbit is inclined at 86\n\n?\n\nrather than 48\n?\n, for example, the payload is reduced by roughly 3 tonnes, reflecting the\n\ndiminishing benefits derived from Earth rotation. In other respects, the east coast of South\nAmerica presents little restriction to eastward launches of any azimuth between zero and\n90?. However, this is clearly launch site specific. Figure 7.11 identifies the launch azimuth\nlimits that apply at the Western Test Range (WTR) (Vandenberg) in Southern California.\nDirect injection is here restricted to launches towards the south-west, over the Pacific\nOcean and away from continental USA, giving access only to retrograde orbits (i > 90?).\nOnly along the 164? azimuth limit is there a possibility of an eastwards launch and a\nsmall contribution from Earth rotation.\n\n\n\nSPACECRAFT LAUNCH PHASES AND MISSION PLANNING 7.3 235\n\n40\u00b0\n\n10\u00b0\n\n150\u00b0 110\u00b0120\u00b0130\u00b0\nWest longitude\n\nCircular orbit\ninjection altitude\n\nLaunch\nazimuth\n\n287\u00b0 Range safety\nazimuth limit\n\nUnited\nstates\n\nVandenberg\n\n164\u00b0\nrange safety\nazimuth limit\n\n18\n2\u00b0\n\n270\u00b0\n\n22\n5\u00b0\n\n140\u00b0\n\n20\u00b0\n\nN\nor\n\nth\n la\n\ntit\nud\n\ne\n\n30\u00b0\n\n200 km\n\n600 km\n\n1000 km\n\nFigure 7.11 Range safety limits and launch trajectories from the WTR\n\n7.3.3 Configuration interactions\n\nWhilst payload mass may be considered to assume an overriding importance in determin-\ning the mission parameters, in many circumstances the spacecraft configuration can also\nbe constrained by the size and shape of the available payload volume. Multi-stage expend-\nable launch vehicles are essentially cylindrical, and aerodynamic considerations naturally\nrestrict the payload fairing (or envelope) to a shape resembling a cone-cylinder combi-\nnation. Spacecraft designed to be launched by such vehicles tend to be slender\u2014at least\nin their stowed configuration\u2014and solar arrays, communications antennas and scientific\ninstruments may have to be folded, furled or telescoped to conform to the fairing and then\ndeployed on station. The inclusion of mechanisms necessary to effect such deployment\nthen adds substantially to the complexity and vulnerability of the payload design.\n\nAlthough the launch phase duration may be measured in hours in a mission with an\noperational timescale of years, the launch often produces the most demanding environment\nfaced by the mechanical design. The longitudinal acceleration is high\u2014for example, in\nexcess of 4.5g0 in the case of Ariane 5 at solid rocket burn-out. Sensitive elements of the\npayload and deployable equipment must therefore withstand both the mean acceleration\nand the structural vibration accompanying motor firing and stage separation (see also\nChapter 8).\n\nAs we indicated in Section 7.3.1, geostationary orbit emplacement may also incorporate\nquite major satellite thrusting phases at apogee (ABM firing). Where motors employ\n\n\n\n236 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nsolid propellants, they deliver relatively high thrusts in firings of short duration (see\nChapter 6). In the absence of fine control of thrust, the spacecraft and motor are spun-up\nto an angular rate of ? 100 rpm. This both provides a measure of gyroscopic stiffness\nfor guidance and reduces the effects of any thrust misalignment. In consequence, how-\never, deployment of lightweight, flexible structures like solar arrays is further delayed and\nsubstantial power-raising in transfer orbit is often prevented. The enhanced mission flex-\nibility that accompanies lower thrust, more readily controlled and higher specific impulse\nbi-propellant rocket motors is a major factor in their development as spacecraft propulsion.\n\n7.4 THE ARIANE 5 LAUNCH VEHICLE\n\nIn the preceding section, we have described some general features of launch vehicle\nperformance and operation from the user or payload perspective. Here we describe the\nAriane 5 launch vehicle in more detail but from the same standpoint. The reader will be\nreferred to other sources for launch vehicle design information.\n\n7.4.1 Vehicle design summary\n\nWhile earlier expendable launch vehicles evolved from missile designs and were adapted\nto a wide range of missions, much of the Ariane programme has been specifically directed\ntowards the task of geostationary communication spacecraft emplacement. Despite sub-\nsequent broadening of the performance envelope through the development of Ariane 1 to\n5, each embracing increased payload mass and envelope, the defining mission remains\nthat of injection into GTO. In the presentation here, we concentrate on the capabilities\nof Ariane 5 in its two key configurations\u2014Ariane 5 ECA, providing direct access to\nGTO, and Ariane 5 ES, servicing LEO [in particular, the launch of the automated transfer\nvehicle (ATV) to the International Space Station (ISS)]. The latter will complement the\ncontinuing use of the Soyuz rocket\u2014soon to be launched from French Guiana also\u2014to\ntransport crews to and from the ISS.\n\nAriane 5 comprises a central core stage, incorporating the Vulcain cryogenic engine, to\nwhich are attached two solid propellant boosters. While these components are common\nto both variants, the ECA and ES versions employ different upper stages\u2014a cryogenic\nmotor for the more powerful ECA and a re-ignitable storable propellant motor for the ES\nversion. The stage mass breakdown for Ariane 5 ECA is summarized in Table 7.3.\n\nTable 7.3 Ariane 5 ECA mass breakdown (tonnes)\n\nStage Dry mass Propellant mass Cumulative mass\n\nSolid rocket booster (each EAP) 39.8 237.7 555 (72%)\nCryogenic main core (EPC) 14.7 143 (LOX) 739.7 (96%)\n\n27 (LH2)\nCryogenic upper stage (ESC-A) 4.5 10.0 (LOX) 769.1 (100%)\n\n4.9 (LH2)\n\nNote: Additional mass arises from items of inter-stage structure and the equipment bay.\n\n\n\nTHE ARIANE 5 LAUNCH VEHICLE 7.4 237\n\nTable 7.4 Ariane 5 ECA engine characteristics\n\nSolid rocket Vulcain 2: main HM7B: cryogenic\nbooster cryogenic core upper stage\n\nVacuum thrust [kN] 7000 1390 67\nVacuum ISP [s] 275 432 446\nChamber pressure [bar] 61 108 35\nBurn time [s] 130 540 945\nPropellant type HTPB LOX/LH2 (5.3:1) LOX/LH2 (2 :1)\n\nNote: HTPB = Hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene\n\nThe two boosters provide the bulk of thrust during the initial phase of the launch,\nburning in parallel with the main stage Vulcain 2 engine. The latter then enters a lengthy\nsustained phase following booster separation before transition to the upper stage HM7B\nmotor. Whilst the Vulcain engine was developed specifically for the Ariane 5 programme,\nthe upper stage motor is that employed on Ariane 4. Both motor designs are based on\ngas generator cycles as described in more detail in Chapter 6.\n\nThe component performance is summarized in Table 7.4. The Ariane 5 launcher\nrepresents a significant departure from the earlier configurations in the Ariane family\nby incorporating two large (EAP) solid boosters, each delivering a vacuum thrust\nof 7000 kN at a specific impulse of 275 s. The Vulcain 2 core stage is a cryogenic\nLH2-LOX engine, delivering a vacuum thrust of 1390 kN at a specific impulse of 432 s.\nTo accommodate the low Earth manoeuvring requirements of the ATV launch, a smaller\nre-ignitable mono-methylhydrazine (MMH)/NTO upper stage replaces the HM7B in the\nES variant.\n\n7.4.2 Mission performance\n\nAriane 5 is launched from the near-equatorial Centre Spatiale Guyanais (CSG) in Kourou,\nFrench Guiana, at a latitude of 5.2?N. As described earlier, such a location is particularly\nfavourable for geostationary satellite emplacement but launches can also be made from\nwithin azimuth limits ?10.5? to 93.5?. Illustrative performance data are shown in the\nAriane 5 users\u2019 manual [5] for purposes of preliminary mission planning, including a\nvariety of elliptical and Sun-synchronous orbits in addition to the primary programme\nobjective of GTO emplacement.\n\nTable 7.5 illustrates the primary mission performance of the two variants into GTO and\ninjection of the ATV. Ariane 5 ECA can launch two spacecraft into GTO with a combined\nmass of 9.6 tonnes, including the additional interface and supporting masses of the dual\nlaunch system.\n\nThe dual launch capability has been an important feature of the Ariane system through-\nout its history and this is maintained within the Ariane 5 programme in the form of\nSYLDA5 and SPELTRA. A brief description of the Systeme de Lancement Double Ariane\n(SYLDA) and payload envelopes is provided later in this chapter.\n\nIf we focus specifically on the dual launch into GTO, both satellites are injected into the\nsame orbit although they may be oriented and spun-up independently as required (up to\n\n\n\n238 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nTable 7.5 Illustrative Ariane 5 performance (tonnes)\n\nAriane 5 ECA\nLiftoff mass 780\nPayload into GTO (dual launch) 9.6\n\nAriane 5 ES ATV\nLiftoff mass 760\nPayload mass (260 \u00d7 260 km; 51.6? inclination) 21 (max)\n\n30?/s in longitudinal mode) after upper-stage engine cut-off. The ACS can provide either\nthree-axis stabilization or spinning modes. A minimum relative velocity of 0.5 m s?1 is\nestablished between the two satellites at separation and a safe distance is determined\nbetween them before apogee motor firing. The argument of perigee at injection is 178?\nand the apogee height is 35 786 km. The GTO inclination is 6? and the longitude of the\nfirst descending node occurs over West Africa. The injection phase is inertially stabilized\nwith high accuracy. For example, typical values cited for the standard deviations of key\ninjection parameters are: 40 km for the semi-major axis, 4.5 \u00d7 10?4 for eccentricity and\n0.02? for inclination.\n\nFor smaller payloads into LEO, multiple separations are also possible with the aid\nof user-defined payload dispensers. If required, the dispenser can be mounted inside\nthe SPELTRA.\n\n7.4.3 Dual-launch system\n\nBuilding on the experience with earlier versions, the dual launch capability of Ariane 5 has\nbeen used extensively for GTO missions. Whilst improvements have been introduced in\nrelation to the system weight and complexity in SYLDA-5, the key features of the SYLDA\nconcept as employed on Ariane 4 remain the same and are illustrated in Figure 7.12.\nA load carrying, carbon-fibre reinforced shell, mounted within the fairing, encapsulates\nthe lower satellite and supports the upper one.\n\nThe shell incorporates two separable parts, retained in flight by a clamp band, providing\nsatellite adapter rings. The two satellites are quite independent, without mechanical or\nelectrical interfaces. The sequence of events leading to the release and injection into\norbit of the two satellites is shown in Figure 7.13. Following upper stage engine cut-\noff, the attitude control system orientates the stage correctly and spins up. Pyrotechnic\ncutters are fired and release the spring-loaded upper passenger. The upper portion of\nthe shell is itself then released pyrotechnically and the lower satellite is exposed and\nspring released.\n\nThe payload accommodation has steadily increased in size over the course of the Ariane\nprogramme and Table 7.6 summarizes the envelope dimensions and masses of the basic\nSYLDA-5 and SPELTRA configurations. A range of alternative adaptors and spacers are\nidentified in the users\u2019 manual [5], permitting some tailored use of the free space.\n\n\n\nUS CREWED LAUNCH SYSTEMS 7.5 239\n\nSeparation springs\n\nPyrotechnic tie\ncutter\n\nInspection hole\n\nSatellite adaptor\nring\n\nMultilayered carbon\nfibre/aluminium\nhoneycomb\n\nLower passenger adaptor\nand separation mechanism\n\nThird stage adaptor\n\nFigure 7.12 SYLDA\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 7.13 Ariane dual-launch separation phases\n\n7.5 US CREWED LAUNCH SYSTEMS\n\nAfter almost 30 years service as the USA\u2019s principal means of launching humans into\norbit, the Space Shuttle fleet is to be retired in 2010. In anticipation of this event, a\nradical rethink of the US human space activity emerged, resulting in the Constellation\nprogramme, the launch components of which comprise the Ares 1 man-rated launcher and\nthe Ares 5 heavy lift launch vehicle. However, the changing political winds generated by\nthe incoming Obama administration, has spawned uncertainty about Ares 1 as a means of\n\n\n\n240 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nTable 7.6 Masses and envelopes for SYLDA-5 and SPELTRA\n\nSYLDA-5\nMaximum diameter 4.5 m\nCylindrical section height 3.2 m\nEmpty mass 440 kg\n\nSPELTRA\nShort version: maximum diameter 5.4 m\n\ncylindrical height 4.1 m\nempty mass 704 kg\n\nLong version: maximum diameter 5.4 m\ncylindrical height 5.6 m\nempty mass 820 kg\n\nUS human access to space. Furthermore, it is proposed to provide funding to US industry\nto encourage innovative solutions to launching human cargo into orbit. It is against this\nbackdrop of political and funding uncertainty that we present this section reviewing US\ncrewed launch systems.\n\nThe Space Shuttle system, as a unique semi-reusable man-rated launcher, warrants\nsignificant mention in this review, and alongside this we have chosen to describe the\nattributes of the Ares 1 vehicle. However, it is fair to say that the future shape of US\nhuman access to orbit is undefined at the time of writing (2010).\n\n7.5.1 Shuttle STS\n\nThe US Shuttle Space Transportation System (STS) was originally intended to be a\nfully reusable, low cost system to transport crew and a wide variety of payloads (up\nto 25 tonnes) to and from LEO. During the design process in the early 1970s, the STS\nevolved, from a piggyback configuration with two winged-reusable vehicles, to its familiar\npresent form, as shown in Figure 7.14. The present configuration comprises the reusable\nwinged Orbiter, coupled with an expendable External Tank (ET) containing cryogenic\npropellants (liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in a mass ratio of 1:6). The original\nwinged-reusable first stage was replaced with two parallel-burning Solid Rocket Boosters\n(SRBs) each made from four segments attached together by clevis joints. The Orbiter uses\nthree throttled Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) with a pre-burner cycle, each with\na vacuum specific impulse of 455 s and maximum thrust of about 2.1 MN. The cryogenic\npropellant required for these engines is cross-fed from the ET. After ET separation, the\nOrbiter uses an Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), fuelled by storable nitrogen tetroxide\nand monomethyl hydrazine propellants, to provide the impulse to acquire and circularize\nthe required orbit. The same OMS is used to de-orbit. During re-entry, the Orbiter develops\nsignificant lift in order to reduce peak entry temperatures and deceleration rates. The\nOrbiter (the primary structure of which is aluminum alloy) is protected during re-entry\nby a Thermal Protection System (TPS). On the lower surfaces of the Orbiter, the TPS\ncomprises an array of small ceramic tiles which have proven to be problematic to maintain\n\n\n\nUS CREWED LAUNCH SYSTEMS 7.5 241\n\nSaturn 5\n\n0\nNASA\n\n100\n\n200\n\nF\nee\n\nt\n\n300\n\n400\n\nSTS Shuttle Ares 1 Ares 5\n\nFigure 7.14 US launch vehicle configurations, in particular STS Shuttle and Ares 1\n(Reproduced by permission of NASA)\n\nand refurbish during the repeated operations of the small Orbiter fleet (each Orbiter has\nbeen flown about 25 times).\n\nAt the time of writing, the Shuttle STS has flown 128 successful missions, and expe-\nrienced two catastrophic failures, over a 29 year period (1981\u20132009). The first failure of\n\u2018Challenger\u2019 STS-51-L (1986) involved a burn-through of an O-ring sealed clevis joint on\none SRB early in the ascent, resulting in a catastrophic explosion of the ET. The second\nfailure of \u2018Columbia\u2019 STS-107 (2003) occurred after the TPS on the leading edge of the\nport wing was penetrated by the impact of a foam wedge from the ET during ascent.\nUnfortunately, since no on-orbit inspection and repair was carried-out, the Orbiter was\nsubsequently destroyed during re-entry.\n\nDespite the proven flexibility of the Shuttle STS for crewed orbital operations, its flight\ncosts have proven to be much higher than was originally envisaged [6]. Consequently, as\nmentioned above, NASA is planning to cease operations in 2010.\n\n7.5.2 Ares 1\n\nContinued uncertainty surrounds the provision of US launcher capability to support future\nmanned missions. If development continues to operations as NASA has envisaged, how-\never, the Ares 1 launch vehicle will provide human access to orbit in around 2015, and\nbeyond [7, 8], and this is predicted to have considerably lower operational costs than the\nShuttle STS\u2014see Figure 7.14.\n\n\n\n242 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nIt was originally intended that Ares 1 would comprise key Shuttle elements with\nminimal modification, to reduce development costs. That is, a first stage derived from\nthe four-segment Shuttle SRB and a cryogenic second stage using a single SSME. In\nearly feasibility study reports, it was stated that this particular configuration would offer\nthe highest overall crew safety and mission reliability, despite the fact that it requires\nin-flight ignition of the second stage cryogenic engine (unlike the Shuttle STS). As the\ndesign evolved, a decision was made to replace the relatively expensive SSME with an\nupdated version of the re-ignitable J2 engine originally used on the Saturn 5 launch vehi-\ncle. The new engine, J2X, with a gas generator cycle, is predicted to have a vacuum\nspecific impulse of 448 s with a thrust of 1.3 MN (about 62% of the SSME thrust in\nvacuum at 100% throttle). As a consequence of this thrust reduction, the first stage of\nAres 1 had to be increased in size. The current baseline adopts a five segment Reusable\nSolid Rocket Motor (RSRM) that is about 25% heavier than a Shuttle SRB. The burn\ntime of the RSRM is similar to the Shuttle SRB (about 120 s), so that burn rates have\nbeen increased significantly\u2014demanding a new ground-test firing programme.\n\nThe total height of the Ares 1 will be about 100 m, somewhat taller than Shuttle, but\nstill within the constraints of the modified Vehicle Assembly Building. The gross lift-off\nmass will be about 46% of the Shuttle\u2019s, well within the capabilities of the Apollo crawler\ntransport that was used to take the vehicle to the launch pad. The first stage RSRM will\nbe recovered using a triple parachute system downrange in the Atlantic. The second stage\nis expended, and expected to burn-up during re-entry over the Indian Ocean. The first\nsuccessful flight of the Ares 1-X test vehicle employed a modified four segment Shuttle\nSRB with a dummy upper-stage [8].\n\nThe primary payload of Ares 1 is intended to be the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle\n(CEV)\u2014an Apollo-like, conically-shaped, ballistic re-entry capsule attached to a service-\npropulsion module [9]. Orion is currently baselined to carry four crew to LEO. When\nstacked on top of Ares 1, the capsule will be shrouded and fitted with a launch abort rocket\nsystem to permit safe separation from the lower stages in the event of a catastrophic failure.\nRe-entry of the Orion capsule will essentially be ballistic with a lift-to-drag ratio less\nthan 0.3 [10]. Hence peak decelerations will be dictated by equation (5.57) in Chapter 5.\nRecovery by parachute on land, as well as in the ocean, has been evaluated.\n\nThe Ares 1 launcher is also viewed as being integral to NASA\u2019s Constellation Pro-\ngramme, with the main motivation to renew manned lunar exploration by about 2020. An\nassociated heavy-lift launcher, Ares 5 [11], would also be required to deliver the cis-lunar\npropulsive stage that will be docked with Orion after rendezvous in LEO. However, as\ndiscussed above, the complete funding of this programme remains uncertain. The com-\nparative mass breakdown for Ares 1 and 5, as originally conceived, is summarized in\nTable 7.7.\n\n7.6 SMALL LAUNCHERS AND REUSABLE\n\nSUB-ORBITAL VEHICLES\n\n7.6.1 Small launchers\n\nThe continuing interest in launching small satellites into LEO\u2014including constellations\nof such satellites, whether for scientific or Earth observation purposes\u2014has prompted\n\n\n\nSMALL LAUNCHERS AND REUSABLE SUB-ORBITAL VEHICLES 7.6 243\n\nTable 7.7 Ares 1 and Ares 5 mass breakdown (tonnes)\n\nAres 1 Ares V\n\nGross lift-off mass 927.1 3705\nRSRM 1st stage mass 732.5 (5 segments) 2 \u00d7 794 (5.5 segments)\nCryogenic 2nd stage mass 152.7 279\nCryogenic propellant mass 115.4 (LOX) 21.7 (LH2) 213 (LOX) 38 (LH2)\nInter-stage mass 4.1 12\nPayload to LEO 27 (Orion CEV) 140-180\nPayload to lunar transfer - 57\n\nTable 7.8 Vega stage characteristics\n\n1st stage: 2nd stage: 3rd stage: 4th stage:\nP80 Zefiro 23 Zefiro 9 AVUM\n\nHeight [m] 10.5 7.5 3.85 1.74\nDiameter [m] 3.0 1.9 1.9 1.9\nPropellant mass [tonnes] 88 23 10 0.55\nThrust [kN] 3040 1200 313 2.45\nVacuum ISP [s] 279 289 294 315\nBurn time [s] 107 71 117 317\nPropellant type HTPB HTPB HTPB UDMH/NTO\n\nNote: HTPB = Hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene; UDMH = Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine;\nNTO = Nitrogen tetroxide\n\nrenewed commercial interest in small launchers, offering flexible operation and making\nmore limited infrastructure demands. A number of such vehicles are now available com-\nmercially or are in development. These typically comprise three- or four-stage solid\npropellant rockets providing a launch capability into Sun-synchronous LEO for payloads\nof approximately 1 tonne. This class of launchers is typified in the USA by the Lockheed\nMartin Athena or the OSC Taurus, a ground-launched version of the Pegasus discussed\nearlier [6]. The key features of the ESA-developed Vega [12], in this same category and\nscheduled for its first flight in late 2010, are summarized in Table 7.8.\n\nWith a lift-off mass of 137 tonnes, Vega will typically launch a 1500 kg payload into\na 90\n\n?\ninclination circular orbit at a height of 700 km.\n\n7.6.2 Reusable sub-orbital vehicles\n\nA number of commercial ventures have recently aspired to offer fare-paying passengers\na sub-orbital flight experience. The most promising of these ventures is the Virgin Galac-\ntic project which plans to use a subsonic aircraft, WhiteKnightTwo, to carry a winged,\nreusable rocket-powered vehicle, SpaceShipTwo, to 50 000 ft. At this altitude, the nitrous\noxide, hybrid propulsion system will be ignited and the rocket vehicle will climb to\nan apogee of about 100 km, carrying six passengers. During the supersonic descent the\n\n\n\n244 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nvehicle cranks its wing to provide inherent aerodynamic stability. The wing is then folded\nback to permit a conventional landing on a runway. The feasibility of this unique, patented\nrecovery system has already been proven in the previous test flights of SpaceShipOne [13].\n\n7.7 RE-ENTRY INTO EARTH\u2019S ATMOSPHERE\n\nIn addition to the transport of payloads and personnel to orbit, some missions will also\nrequire their secure recovery from orbit\u2014whether simply scientific samples for analysis or\ncrew return from the ISS, and potentially further afield. With the exception of the Shuttle,\nwhich affords the opportunity to use aerodynamic lift to control the re-entry trajectory,\nrecovery from orbit has been principally achieved using ballistic re-entry capsules.\n\nBallistic recovery essentially involves using aerodynamic drag to decelerate a vehicle\nfrom an entry velocity V0, prior to parachute deployment, and subsequent impact on the\nEarth\u2019s surface with an acceptable velocity. The maximum deceleration rates involved in\npurely ballistic re-entry are relatively high compared to the launch ascent accelerations,\ntypically exceeding about ?8g0, depending on the entry angle (which must be within\nprescribed maximum and minimum limits). In practice, re-entry capsules are flown at\nincidence, relative to the flight direction, to generate a lift force similar in magnitude,\nthough generally less than, the drag force. This permits the adoption of trajectories that\nreduce the peak deceleration and peak heat transfer rates (see Figure 7.15), as well as\nproviding some control on the dimensions of the landing footprint.\n\nThe essential features of atmospheric re-entry were first considered by Allen and Eggers\n[15] and employed extensively in the Apollo programme, see also Section 5.8.5.

(7.17)\n\nIf atmospheric density is approximated by a simple exponential model,\n\n?/?s = exp(??h)\nwhere h is the vehicle altitude above some reference height at which the density is ?s , ?\nis assumed to be shallow and held constant at the value ?0, and the drag force is assumed\nto be much larger than the vehicle weight, then it can be shown that the vehicle velocity\nwill vary as,\n\nV = V0 exp\n[ ??\n\n2(m/CD S )? sin ?0\n\n]\n(7.18)\n\nFurthermore, as seen in Section 5.8.5 of Chapter 5, the peak deceleration rate is given by\n\n????dVdt\n????\nmax\n\n= ?V\n2\n\n0 sin ?0\n2e\n\n(7.19)\n\nwhere e is the natural base of logarithms. Then for purely ballistic re-entry from a LEO,\nthe peak deceleration rate is essentially dependent only on the entry angle, ?0.\n\nLees [16] showed that blunt-shaped bodies are needed in order to reduce re-entry\nheating, since stagnation point heat transfer rates are inversely proportional to the square\nroot of the nose radius of curvature rnose in the laminar hypersonic regime,\n\nq? = k?1/2V 3/rnose1/2 (7.20)\nEven adopting such features, thermal protection systems are also needed to prevent exces-\nsive heating of the payload. In particular, the most prevalent protection schemes employ\nablative heat shields in which significant heat is absorbed during vaporization of the\nsurface material (for example, of an epoxy resin), as adopted on the Apollo command\nmodule entry capsule. In addition to absorbing energy through phase change, the vehicle\nsurface is further shielded by the efflux of ablating material entering the boundary layer\n(see Figures 7.16 and 7.17).\n\nWhereas the peak deceleration rate is independent of the so-called \u2018ballistic coefficient\u2019,\nm/SC D , Eggers and Allen [15] showed that the peak heating rates are proportional to\nits square root (see equation (5.58) of Chapter 5) and quadrupling the frontal area of\nthe vehicle will halve the peak heat transfer rate. The successful return to Earth of dust\nsamples collected during encounter with a cometary tail, as in the sample return capsule of\nthe Stardust spacecraft in 2002, have benefitted from improved thermal protection systems\n(TPS) employing a \u2018phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator\u2019 (PICA) [17]. Such materials\nare now to be incorporated, for example, in the Orion crew exploration vehicle design [18].\n\nPeak heat transfer rates may also be reduced by modifying the flight trajectory using lift\nduring the re-entry phase (see Figure 7.15). The Shuttle Orbiter re-enters the atmosphere\nat high angle of attack (about 40?) and at hypersonic speeds it attains a lift/drag ratio\n\n\n\n246 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\n+ Radiation from\n   surface\n\nVehicle\nstructure\n\nSolid ablative shield\n\nBoundary layer\n\nHeated\nthickness\n\nEffl\nux\n\nEfflux\n\nPerturbation of\nincident temperature\nand velocity fields\n\nRadiation\nfrom hot gas\n\nBow shock wave\n\nFigure 7.16 Schematic of an ablating surface thermal protection system\n\nAluminium inner\nhoneycomb cabin wall\n\nInsulation\n\nAblative heat shield\n\n170 < TBond line < 600K\n\n280 < TC < 370K\n\nManned\ncompartment\n\nEquipment bay\n\nStainless steel\nhoneycomb\n\nParachutes\n\nFigure 7.17 Schematic of the Apollo command module thermal protection system\n\nof about 2. By also rolling the vehicle about its longitudinal axis, while maintaining the\nhigh angle of attack the lift vector can be modulated. In this way the rate at which the\nvehicle descends into the atmosphere, and hence the heating rate, can be controlled. This\nalso serves to determine the across-track range that can be achieved.\n\nThe Orbiter employs a reusable thermal protection system that is zoned according to\nthe local heating levels\u2014see Figure 7.18. The nose and wing leading edges receive the\nhighest heating rates and are consequently made from reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC).\nMost of the body and wing surfaces are covered by pure silica-fibre tiles coated with a\nborosilicate glass. On the upper surface of the wing and the payload bay doors, where\nheating rates are much reduced, flexible coated Nomex felt is sufficient.\n\nAbout 8% of the Orbiter dry mass is taken-up by the thermal protection system\u2014which\nresults in a significant payload penalty from the standpoint of a user who does not require\nrecovery. Furthermore, the Orbiter often requires significant post-flight maintenance to\ncheck, remove and replace the ceramic tiles.\n\n\n\nSPECIFIC LAUNCH COSTS AND RELIABILITY 7.8 247\n\nHRSI\n\nHRSI\n\nHRSI\n\nFRSI\n\nFRSI\n\nLRSI\n\nLRSI\n\nRCC\n\nRCC\n\nRCC\n\nUpper surface\n\nUnder surface\n\nFigure 7.18 The Shuttle Orbiter thermal protection system.

The\nlauncher and related services, such as insurance, continue to introduce costs which may\nbe comparable with those of the spacecraft payload itself. For example, specific launch\ncosts into GTO of ?25 k$/kg (see Table 7.9) remain high and so continue to constrain\nthe commercial and scientific exploitation of space.\n\n\n\n248 LAUNCH VEHICLES\n\nTable 7.9 Illustrative launch costs into LEO and GTO (FY2000 US$) [6, 20]\n\nLaunch vehicle LEO payload [kg] Launch cost [M$] Specific cost [k$/kg]\n\nAthena 2 2060 24 11.7\nPegasus XL 440 14 31.8\nRockot 1850 14 7.6\nTaurus 1380 19 13.8\n\nGTO payload [kg]\n\nAtlas 2AS 3720 98 26.3\nDelta 2 (7920) 1800 55 30.6\nLong March 2C 1000 23 23\nSoyuz 1350 39 28.9\nAriane 5ES 6800 165 24.3\nLong March 3B 5200 60 11.5\nProton 4630 90 19.4\nSea Launch (Zenit3) 5250 85 16.2\n\nTable 7.10 Launch Success Rate Data (to December 2003) [6]\n\nLaunch vehicle Number of launches Successful launches Launch success rate\n\nAthena 1/2 7 5 0.71\nPegasus XL 25 21 0.84\nRockot 2 2 1.00\n\nTaurus 6 4 0.67\nAtlas 2/3 30 30 1.00\nDelta 2 110 108 0.98\nSoyuz 713 692 0.97\n\nAriane 5 17 13 0.76\nLong March 3 26 21 0.81\nProton 295 262 0.89\nSea Launch (Zenit3) 11 10 0.91\n\nThe insurance charges accompanying launch essentially reflect the reliability of the\nparticular vehicle. Mission success levels of >90% are typical of established systems\n(see Table 7.10) although small rockets do tend to remain generally less reliable. Whilst\nthese levels can evidently be improved further, progress is incremental and substantial\nreductions in overall costs and reliability will only be realized if there are major changes\nin the design of future launch vehicles.\n\nGiven the widespread application of high-energy propellants currently, notably\nLH2/LOX delivering a vacuum specific impulse of 432 s in the case of the Vulcain 2\nengine on Ariane 5, and payload fractions of ?3%, there is arguably limited opportunity\nfor very substantial reductions in the launch costs of expendable vehicles to be derived\nfrom improved technology.\n\n\n\nREFERENCES 249\n\nThe present high levels of cost continue to provide much of the stimulus for feasibility\nstudies and technology demonstration programmes directed to the incorporation\nof reusability into launch vehicle design [21]. The operational economies that might\naccompany vehicle-centred logistical support have encouraged numerous studies of single-\nand two-stage-to-orbit concepts in recent decades\u2014some incorporating air-breathing\nelements. However, few have progressed beyond conceptual design. The short-lived\nNASA X-33 demonstrator programme [22\u201324] represented one of the more determined\nattempts in the 1990s to exploit the best contemporary lightweight materials and novel\npropulsion technologies, such as the linear aerospike nozzle [25] (see Chapter 6).\n\nIn most cases, the principal drawback to reusability is that it adds a significant mass\npenalty to an already performance-stretched system. Furthermore, although the opera-\ntions of the Space Shuttle have shown that reusability permits some improvement\u2014for\nexample, in permitting post-flight subsystem checks and continuous upgrades\u2014there is\nlittle indication that fully reusable launch systems would deliver much greater reliabil-\nity or introduce major costs reductions. From a user standpoint, other factors, such as a\nreduction in the time between commissioning and launch date or improved orbit injection\naccuracy, may therefore be more important launch service considerations.\n\nIn this chapter we have sought to identify the complex tasks involved in transporting\na payload from the Earth\u2019s surface to a designated orbit. We have outlined many of the\nbasic principles that determine launch vehicle design and performance and, in so doing,\nillustrated how they constrain both payload and mission. On present evidence, rocket\ntechnology will continue to underpin this process and the constraints identified seem\nlikely to persist for at least the next decade.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Vinh, N.X.

Houghton\n\nEADS Astrium, Stevenage\n\n8.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe discipline and methods of spacecraft structural design are based upon aircraft design\nwith a stronger emphasis upon minimum weight, vibration interaction and material selec-\ntion considerations for space use. The major goals of minimum mass and maximum\nreliability must be met with minimum cost and schedule. The structure must achieve its\ngoals for the static and dynamic loading of the testing and launch phases, and ultimately\nin the zero gravity operational environment. What makes spacecraft structural engineer-\ning perhaps unique is that its goals are strongly dependent on other subsystems such as\nthermal design, attitude control, communications and power.\n\nStructural design starts with configuration definition, material selection and manufactur-\ning method selection, moving on to analysis and verification with an increasing reliance\nbeing placed upon analysis as experience grows.\n\n8.2 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\n\nPreviously successful structure design concepts (such as those shown in Section 8.7)\ngive a good starting point for future development. The relative importance of the factors\ndiscussed in the following subsections need to be assessed before development of a\nstructure design concept.\n\n8.2.1 Launch vehicle interface\n\nLaunch vehicle selection has a major influence on geometric and mass limits. Some\nlaunchers have the capability of launching more than one spacecraft at a time. Figure 8.1\nshows the Ariane 5 dual launch configuration. Note that there is no connection between the\nfairing and the spacecraft.

Figure 8.2 shows that up\nto eight smaller spacecraft may be launched by the ASAP5 adaptor for Ariane 5.\n\nCompetition between launch vehicle suppliers encourages the use of standard interfaces,\ngiving the customer the option of using alternative launch vehicles with the same interface\ndesign. A commonly used adaptor is shown in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.4 shows a sectional\nview of a manacle clamp used to attach the spacecraft (see also Chapter 15).\n\nUp to 12 accurately machined clamp blocks are placed to form a segmented ring over\ncorrespondingly accurately machined wedge shaped lips on both the launch vehicle and\nspacecraft side of the interface. The clamp band is then tightened over these blocks by\ntwo pyrotechnic bolts. This gives an even distribution of load around the circular launch\nvehicle interface and a reliable release mechanism.\n\nOne route to an efficient structural design is to provide continuity to a clamp band\ncircular load path with a circular central thrust structure in the spacecraft. Additional\nstructure must then be designed to support all spacecraft equipment from the central thrust\nstructure. This may be seen in many of the configuration examples given in Section 8.7.\n\nMany launch vehicles also offer discrete pyrotechnic bolt interfaces using between\nthree and eight bolts. This type of interface concentrates the load at these discrete bolt\n\n\n\nDESIGN REQUIREMENTS 8.2 253\n\nFigure 8.2 Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP5) for Ariane 5.

The influence of this is illus-\ntrated by the difference between the Eurostar Structure configuration of Figure 8.19, which\nis designed for a clamp band attachment, and the Swarm Configuration of Figure 8.20\nwhich is designed for a three discrete bolt interface.\n\n8.2.2 Equipment mounting\n\nA flat, bolted interface is used for most items of equipment, dictating the need for large\nflat areas on the structure where a significant number of equipment units are carried. The\nflat panels seen in many of the examples in Section 8.7 are designed primarily for this\npurpose. Large areas of panel may need to be supported by perpendicular panels or struts\nto strengthen and stiffen the panel and limit the magnitude of vibration for equipment.\n\nThe primary structure may have to be specifically designed to efficiently carry\nlarge or heavy equipment, such as larger propellant tanks, which require strong and\nstiff attachments.\n\n8.2.3 Environmental protection\n\nThe structure design trade-off may be biased towards a loaded skin structure with a\ncomposite section as described in Section 8.6 (as opposed to a framework structure) to\nmeet the requirements for micrometeorite, debris or radiation protection.\n\n\n\nDESIGN REQUIREMENTS 8.2 255\n\n8.2.4 Alignment\n\nThe required accuracy of alignment can vary widely, from a broad tolerance for a com-\nmunication spacecraft providing a global service to a very tight tolerance for accurate\nlocation pointing. Distortion has three main sources. Firstly, all alignment and testing of\nthe spacecraft will be done terrestrially under a 1 g loading. The structural elastic dis-\ntortion between critical equipments generated by the 1 g environment must be calculated\nand possibly verified by mathematical model correlation with static load testing. Sec-\nondly, there will be a small movement or hysteresis in the structure as a result of launch\nvibration. This can usually only be judged from previous test experience. Thirdly, when\non-station, there will be temperature variations throughout the structure, and differences\nin temperature from the time of ground alignment will generate thermo-elastic distortions.\nThe distortions these generate through the material expansion coefficients may be calcu-\nlated using the structure finite element model. A requirement for moderately high pointing\naccuracy can bias material choice to carbon fibre reinforced plastic structures for antenna\nreflectors, for example, where the operating temperature range can be large (?160?C to\n+160?C). The highest thermal stability requires the use of ceramic structures for items\nsuch as optical benches, but use of these materials must be approached with caution due\nto their low strength and fracture toughness.\n\n8.2.5 Thermal and electrical conductivity\n\nThermal control may require heat pipes to be embedded in structural honeycomb panels\nor thick conductive doublers to be added to dissipate heat from high-powered equip-\nment. Thermal conductivity or isolation may be required through a structure and at\nstructural joints.\n\nThe structure may be required to provide a ground return path for electrical circuits.\nElectromagnetic compatibility (see Chapter 16) may be required to prevent electrostatic\ndischarge. These requirements give a preference for metallic structures, but composites\nmay still be a better option with electrical or thermally conductive strapping.\n\n8.2.6 Accessibility\n\nAll stages of spacecraft assembly, integration and verification (see also Chapter 17) must\nbe carefully considered, with any likely equipment refurbishment requirements, to estab-\nlish the level of accessibility required inside the structure and whether any parts must be\ninterchangeable, testable or transportable with equipment installed.\n\n8.2.7 Mass\n\nThe cost of engineering and manufacture to achieve minimum mass must be compared\nwith launch cost to give a guide to the effort it is worth spending to achieve a reduction.\nFor the example of a geosynchronous communications spacecraft, the most commonly\n\n\n\n256 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nused \u2018Western World\u2019 expendable launch vehicles cost approximately $25 000 to launch\n1 kg of spacecraft mass to GTO (see also Chapter 7). This can be overridden by absolute\nmass limits. Launch costs are much lower for LEO missions giving relatively stronger\nemphasis on minimum cost.\n\n8.3 MATERIAL SELECTION\n\n8.3.1 Material properties\n\nThe selection of an appropriate material for an application requires knowledge of the\nadvantage to be gained from each property of the material and where each limitation\nmust be recognized.\n\nSelection criteria can encompass the following:\n\n\u2022 specific strength,\n\u2022 specific stiffness,\n\u2022 stress corrosion resistance,\n\u2022 fracture and fatigue resistance,\n\u2022 thermal expansion coefficient and conductivity,\n\u2022 ease of manufacture.\n\nSpecific strength and stiffness\n\nAn elementary comparison of materials can be made by examining their proof strengths\n(the stress at which a material will sustain a permanent deformation of 0.1 or 0.2%\nwhen the load is removed). Specific proof strength is this stress divided by the material\ndensity. Values for a selection of widely used lightweight materials are given in Table 8.1.\nFor metals, titanium shows up well but it is only used where strength is the dominant\ncriteria\u2014at joints and areas of local load concentration. For all other applications of\nlightweight structures, overall strength is determined by buckling. The material property\nthat determines the buckling strength of slender structures is stiffness.\n\nThe material efficiency criteria derived for the three design cases in Figure 8.5 are\nincluded in columns D, E and F of Table 8.1 to aid material selection [1]. The efficiencies\nof titanium and aluminium alloys are similar despite the greater strength of the former.\nAshby and Jones have given an explicit treatment of this subject together with illuminating\ncase studies [2].\n\nStress corrosion resistance\n\nStress corrosion cracking (SCC) can develop in a terrestrial environment containing a\ncorrosive medium and moisture when materials are subject to sustained tensile loading,\nparticularly in the short transverse grain direction. Tensile loading conditions can exist\neven when in storage, due to weight, residual stress or joint assembly preload.

Erosion by atomic oxygen, particularly in respect of polymeric materials\nin LEO, can be an important factor in material selection [4, 5]. This is a subject of\ninvestigation and research, in view of the possible long-term problems which could ensue\nin the 25-year life of a space station, for example.\n\n\n\nMATERIAL SELECTION 8.3 259\n\nEase of manufacture/modification\n\nSome materials present individual problems during component manufacture. For example,\nsome forms of beryllium and the cutting fluids used present toxic material control\nproblems, which preclude late modification in unsuitable facilities. It is not unusual for\nadditional mounting points or cut outs for cable run clearances to be needed at a very\nlate stage in integration.\n\nAdvanced materials\n\nThe aerospace industry has driven the development of numerous advanced materials in\nthe search for more mass efficient structures. In most cases cost is a significant factor\nsince, particularly in the space sector, designs are very low volume/high quality applica-\ntions. Many materials developments now fail to reach maturity simply on the grounds of\neconomics. There are exceptions where the need for a technical solution is paramount. A\ngood example is high stability ceramic optical bench material.\n\nA wide range of materials with developed characteristics is discussed in useful detail\nwith a commentary on fabrication, jointing and applications in [6, 7]. These materials can\ngenerally be grouped as follows:\n\n\u2022 Polymer composites\nContinuous fibre reinforcements:\n\nCarbon\nAramid\nGlass\n\nMatrix:\nEpoxy\nPolyimide\nBismaleimide\n\nThermoplastic:\nCarbon in polyether ether ketone (PEEK)\nAramide-based (PEI)\n\n\u2022 Advanced metal matrix and ceramic materials\nMagnesium alloys and their composites\nAluminium alloys and their composites\nTitanium alloys and their composites\nSuper alloys and their composites\nIntermetallic materials\nRefractory materials\nBeryllium\nCeramic matrix composites\nGlass and glass-ceramic matrix composites\nCarbon-carbon matrix composites\n\n\n\n260 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nThese materials offer substantial advantages for some specific requirements, provided\ntheir characteristics are well understood. Care must be taken with the non-linear stress\nstrain response and brittleness of some of them. The long term effects of on-orbit\ntemperature and radiation have been evaluated [8] and must be considered when\nsizing components.\n\n8.3.2 Materials applications\n\nMetals\n\nFerrous alloys have numerous applications in which their properties of high strength,\ncorrosion resistance and toughness are required.\n\nAustenitic stainless steels are used for propulsion and cryogenic systems due to their\nexcellent low temperature toughness. Other alloys are used in optical and precision\nstructures where properties can be selected to match expansion criteria in a dynamic\nthermal environment.\n\nSusceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement is a potential hazard for ferrous alloys,\nparticularly where they have been treated in plating solutions. The result is similar to SCC.\nThe corrective treatment is a severe bake-out within a limited time period\u2014observing\nof course that the materials are not affected.\n\nSome types of stainless steel and invar are magnetic. This can be a problem when a\nspacecraft carries electromagnetic sensors.\n\nFibre reinforced composites\n\nAdvantage can be taken of the high strength offered along the fibre. In a single ply of\nunidirectional fibres, the ply strength and stiffness in the fibre direction is about 60%\nof the fibre strength and stiffness due to the presence of the relatively low strength and\nstiffness resin. In the other two orthogonal directions, strength and stiffness is limited to the\nproperties of the matrix resin. A multi-ply laminate can be built by adding unidirectional\nplies aligned at an angle to the first. A laminate can be created with structural properties\ntailored to the application. The high unidirectional strength and stiffness, such as is quoted\nin Table 8.1 will be reduced in any one direction by approximately the ratio of the number\nof plies in that direction to the number of plies in the complete laminate. Methods for\nthe analysis of individual ply stresses, and failure prediction of a laminate have been\ndeveloped [9, 10]. Computer programs are commercially available from agencies such as\nESA, which enable much quicker analysis, particularly where optimization is required.\n\nCarbon epoxy materials are used quite extensively in fabrication by hand lay up of uni-\ndirectional or woven plies to produce flat or curved panels often of honeycomb sandwich\nconstruction. Large deployable antenna reflectors use the combination of high stiffness,\nlightweight and low coefficient of expansion (to hold shape under temperature extremes)\nto particular advantage.\n\nFilament winding and tape placement of strut tubes and spacecraft central thrust tubes\nare used where the direction of loading is well defined.\n\nA note of caution, particularly with carbon fibre-based composites, is that hygroscopic\nabsorption can add up to 2% water by weight in a normal atmosphere which can reduce\n\n\n\nMATERIAL SELECTION 8.3 261\n\nstrength. Once exposed to the space environment they lose the water and exhibit small\ndimensional changes. Methods of managing this include total control of the component\u2019s\nenvironment, baking-out prior to alignment, and barrier coatings to seal the moisture in\nor out. None of these methods are totally convincing. Careful choice of the resin system\ncan also limit this effect.\n\nCarbon composite materials are brittle, requiring careful consideration of stress con-\ncentrations produced by features such as holes, sudden changes of section, grooves or\nfillets which will reduce the static strength by the magnitude of the corresponding stress\nconcentration factor. This contrasts with the more generally used high strength aluminium\nor titanium alloys, which have sufficient ductility to make them insensitive to most stress\nconcentrations under static loading. For ductile materials, stress concentrations are of\nmore concern under cyclic fatigue loading.\n\nFor this reason, and because complex shapes are more difficult to manufacture in\ncomposites, they tend to find application in relatively simple components\u2014strut tubes\n(but not end fittings) and central thrust structures\u2014but not attachment fittings and flanges.\nComplex components such as strut end fittings are sometimes made in composites, but\nthis is usually when stiffness, and not joint strength, is the design driver.\n\nUnlike metals, the tension and compression bulk modulus of composite materials may\ndiffer significantly, complicating the vibration response.\n\nComposite materials (metal matrix)\n\nThe limiting factors of an epoxy matrix can be substantially overcome by employing\nhigh strength fibres in a diffusion bonded metal matrix. Although this technology may\nrepresent the ultimate direction for \u2018designed\u2019 materials, current costs are high and care\nis required with non-destructive testing (NDT). Some materials suffer from low yield\nstrength or elongation to failure, which is an indication of brittleness, notch sensitivity\nand poor fatigue strength. However, applications are emerging, one particular example\nbeing lightweight mirrors and optical benches [11].\n\nIn general, a clear rule to be borne in mind is to choose materials (or their close equiva-\nlents) that appear in the ESA handbooks [6, 7] or American standards [12, 13]. This gives\nall of the design and approval data necessary, and the confidence that no non-compliances\nwill be discovered later in a programme when any required material qualification testing\nis completed. When this is not possible, national defence specifications should be used\nfor guidance. In all cases, material tractability, including treatment history from billet/raw\nmaterial to finished product, is one of the quality assurance records to be maintained.\n\n8.3.3 Section properties\n\nHollow or reduced section members such as tubes and \u2018I\u2019 beams give much better mass\nefficiency than solid bars. Panel deformations such as corrugations can give greatly\nincreased stiffness and resistance to buckling compared with flat sections. It is the art\nof the design engineer to use materials most efficiently in this way when considering all\nof the duties required of a section.\n\nHoneycomb panels have relatively low weight and high bending stiffness. Figure 8.6\nshows the general configuration of a honeycomb sandwich.\n\n\n\n262 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nTop skin\n\nAdhesive film\n\nHoneycomb core\n\nHoneycomb panel\nBottom skin\n\nAdhesive film\n\nFigure 8.6 Honeycomb panel.

Figure 8.7 shows a widely used blind potted insert. The potting compound trans-\nmits bolt tension load to the core while bearing transfers of shear loads from the insert\nto the hole in the panel skin.\n\n8.3.4 Quality Assurance\n\nThe final proof of a structure\u2019s integrity involves a combination of analysis, inspection\nand test. Non-destructive testing using X-ray techniques can be employed to find voids\nin materials and joints, and ultrasonic techniques can be used to find lack of adhesion\nin bonded joints or laps in wrought materials. In the case of low volume production\nof spacecraft structures, considerable care must be taken to ensure that integrity can\nbe assured in the face of variability due to individual ply angle errors hidden within a\nlaminate, bonding or complex section. Added to this is the problem of ensuring that the\nstructure has not degraded during test.\n\n8.4 ANALYSIS\n\n8.4.1 Building a finite element model\n\nA finite element model for analysis of the structure is an essential part of the design\ndevelopment process. It serves the following purposes:\n\n\u2022 to determine load distributions internal to a structure with multiple load paths;\n\u2022 to predict spacecraft overall natural frequencies;\n\u2022 to predict the level of spacecraft response to low frequency vibration;\n\u2022 to be used by the launch vehicle contractor to determine the mission-specific maxi-\n\nmum loads, accelerations and deflections and thereby determine sine test input level\nreductions (notching); and\n\n\u2022 to apportion stiffness and corresponding strength requirements to sub-structured\nappendages.\n\nFigure 8.8 shows a notional structure divided into a large number of discrete quadrilat-\neral elements. Material properties, shape, degrees of freedom and connection to the next\nelement are defined [14, 15].\n\nWithin each element the rate of change of stress is limited by the element formulation.\nEvery corner point that may be connected to several elements is called a node. Between\nany two nodes on the edge of an element, there is a constant state of stress and strain.\nThe mesh may not be fine enough to capture rapidly varying peaks of stress, and an\noverly coarse mesh will overestimate the stiffness of a structure by not representing small\nradius of curvature deflections. The temptation is, therefore, to use a very fine mesh\nto be sure that peaks are not missed and stiffness is not misrepresented. However this\napproach must be tempered by the mathematical size of the complete model, defined by\nthe number of degrees of freedom it contains. Every node has six degrees of freedom for\n\n\n\n264 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nY\n\nX\n\nElement\nlevel\n\n(K )e{u}e = {f }e\n\nUy\n\nUx\n\nFigure 8.8 Finite element modelled area\n\nmovement\u2014three orthogonal translations and three rotations. The total number of degrees\nof freedom in a complete model is six times the number of nodes (this may be reduced by\nintroducing constraints which eliminate some unimportant degrees of freedom). It is the\ntotal number of degrees of freedom in a model that determines the mathematical size of the\ncomputation required. This, in turn, is limited by the power of the computer being used.\n\nModels may be composed of a number of element types. A selection of these is shown\nin Figure 8.9.\n\nThe simplest of these are axial elements (to represent struts) which can be made math-\nematically more complex to carry torsion and moments. The two main types of planar\nelements are membrane and plate elements. The former cannot sustain out of plane bend-\ning and shear, while the latter can. The third major type is solid or three-dimensional\nelements, which are required to predict complex three-dimensional stresses and deflec-\ntions. They are not widely used in lightweight structures - only at relatively heavy fittings\nsuch as propellant tank attachments and launch vehicle interface brackets.\n\nA complete spacecraft finite element model is constructed from sub-models, which are\nideally provided by the designers of the respective hardware subassembly who have the\nbest knowledge of its structural behaviour. The spacecraft finite element model construc-\ntion therefore emulates the construction of the hardware. Also, the maturity and accuracy\nof the model reflects the maturity of the design. At the concept design stage, some gross\nassumptions may be made. The accuracy of the model should be kept current with the\ndesign, such that during spacecraft testing the model accuracy can be verified by test.\n\n\n\nANALYSIS 8.4 265\n\n(a\n) \n\nA\nxi\n\nal\n e\n\nle\nm\n\nen\nt\n\n(a\n) T\n\nria\nng\n\nle\n\n(a\n) T\n\nria\nng\n\nle\n\n(b\n) \n\nQ\nua\n\ndr\nila\n\nte\nra\n\nl\n\n(a\n) T\n\net\nra\n\nhe\ndr\n\non\n\n(b\n) \n\nH\nex\n\nah\ned\n\nro\nn\n\n(b\n) T\n\nor\nqu\n\ne \nel\n\nem\nen\n\nt\n\n(c\n) \n\nB\nea\n\nm\n b\n\nen\ndi\n\nng\n e\n\nle\nm\n\nen\nt\n\nY Y\n\nYY\n\nX X\n\nXX\nZ Z\n\nZZ\n\n(b\n) \n\nQ\nua\n\ndr\nila\n\nte\nra\n\nl\n\nB\nas\n\nic\n li\n\nne\n e\n\nle\nm\n\nen\nts\n\nB\nas\n\nic\n p\n\nla\nte\n\n b\nen\n\ndi\nng\n\n e\nle\n\nm\nen\n\nts\n\nB\nas\n\nic\n m\n\nem\nbr\n\nan\ne \n\nel\nem\n\nen\nts\n\nB\nas\n\nic\n th\n\nre\ne-\n\ndi\nm\n\nen\nsi\n\non\nal\n\n s\nol\n\nid\n e\n\nle\nm\n\nen\nts\n\nF\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n8\n.9\n\nS\nta\n\nn\nd\n\nar\nd\n\nfi\nn\n\nit\ne\n\nel\nem\n\nen\nts\n\nfo\nr\n\nm\no\n\nd\nel\n\nlin\ng\n\n\n\n266 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\n8 Super elements      Degrees of freedom\n\n?X reflector 7145\n?X feed 13867\n+X reflector 7782\n+X feed 13819\n?Y solar array 21121\n+Y solar array 21121\nTop floor antenna 58387\nPlatform 32498\nTotal 175740\n\nElement types\n\n24671         quad 4\n  7114         tria 3\n  9371         bar\n  6936         elas\n    348         hexa\n33302         grids\n\nFigure 8.10 Complete spacecraft finite element model.

All are treated slightly differently and are critical for\ndifferent parts of the structure.\n\n\n\nANALYSIS 8.4 267\n\nTable 8.2 Launch quasi-static loads for Ariane 5\n\nCritical flight event Acceleration (g)\n\nLongitudinal Lateral Additional line\nload (N/mm)\n\nStatic Dynamic Static + Dynamic\n\nLift off ?1.8 +/? 1.5 +/? 2 10\nMaximum dynamic pressure ?2.7 +/? 0.5 +/? 2 14\nSRB end of flight ?4.55 +/? 1.45 +/? 1 20\nMain core thrust tail off ?0.2 +/? 1.4 +/? 0.25 0\nMax. tension case: SRB jettisoning +2.5 +/? 0.9 0\nNote: The minus sign with longitude axis values indicates compression.\n\nQuasi-static loads\n\nThese are generated by a uniform level of acceleration throughout the whole spacecraft\nthat may exist for just an instant. They include a vibration, or transient, component but\nthe frequency content of this will be separated from the natural frequencies of the space-\ncraft, and therefore will not cause significant magnification of acceleration throughout\nthe spacecraft. Maxima occur at transonic buffeting and at main engine shut down, rather\nthan at lift off. Just before engine shut down, the thrust level is maintained at a maximum,\nwhile the launcher fuel mass is at a minimum\u2014consequently, the vehicle acceleration\nreaches a maximum. Quasi-static loads are critical for the major load bearing parts of the\nstructure spacecraft such as the central thrust tube shown in the configuration examples.\nTable 8.2 give the quasi-static loads for Ariane 5.\n\nLateral loads may act in any direction simultaneously with longitudinal loads.\n\nSine vibration\n\nThe sine vibration environment for Ariane 5 is given in Table 8.3. It is a relatively simply\ndefined envelope of all of the many complex low frequency transient vibrations that\nmay occur during launch. For a qualification sine vibration test, a spacecraft in launch\nconfiguration is attached to a large \u2018shaker\u2019 which starts vibrating at 5 Hz. The frequency\nof the vibration is increased at a rate of 2 octaves (doublings) per minute. In one minute\nthe frequency increases from 5 Hz, through 10 to 20 Hz. This continues until 100 Hz is\nreached when the test stops.\n\nAny lightweight spacecraft will have resonant frequencies in this range which can cause\nresponses in the spacecraft 20 or more times the specified input. If these responses are in\nexcess of the predicted launch transient responses, the defined test input may be reduced,\nor notched at critical response frequencies by agreement with the launcher agency. Such an\nagreement requires demonstration by the spacecraft-and-launcher coupled loads transient\nanalysis that the reduced response within the spacecraft in the notched sine test is still\ngreater than that to be expected from launch transients. A strong emphasis is therefore\nplaced upon the accuracy of the mathematical model of the spacecraft supplied by the\nspacecraft designer, which may also be verified by the sine vibration test.\n\n\n\n268 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nTable 8.3 Sine vibration environment for Ariane 5.

This is because the launcher mass is much higher\nthan it is at second stage cut-off. The transient magnitude is so great in second stage\n\n\n\nANALYSIS 8.4 269\n\ncut-off that the force becomes negative (in this case tensile). This is the reason for the\nspecification of a tensile case in the quasi-static loads (Table 8.2). These are just two\nexamples of coupled loads analysis recovery. Hundreds of accelerations, displacements\nand forces may be recovered for many different flight events.\n\nAcoustic noise and random vibration\n\nThe largest acoustic noise excitation occurs at the point of lift-off when the reflected noise\nfrom the launch pad and ambient air pressure are greatest. An Ariane 5 acoustic noise\nspectrum is shown in Table 8.4.\n\nOctave (doubling) bands are used to partition the spectrum. Acoustic noise can be\ncritical for the design of lightweight structures with large area and low mass, such as dish-\ntype antenna reflectors, solar arrays and spacecraft side panels with low mass attachments.\nThe magnitude of the random vibration response, in terms power spectral density, can be\ncalculated or measured in the frequency domain. This is the mean square of acceleration\nin each one Hertz bandwidth of the spectrum. Acoustic test results from similar, previous\ndesigns are often used to estimate the responses of complex structures.\n\nUnder 100 Hz, the launch vehicle random vibration environment for a complete space-\ncraft is usually covered by the sine vibration environment testing. Above 100 Hz acoustic\nenvironment testing can be critical for large projected area spacecraft while spacecraft\nrandom vibration may be critical for smaller spacecraft (less than 1000 kg) but this is\ndependent on stiffness and mass of large area components.\n\nRandom vibration testing is widely used during development and qualification of space-\ncraft equipment to be sure that no problems will be found at the relatively late stage of\nintegrated spacecraft acoustic noise or random vibration testing. The required test level\nis judged from previous test experience. An example is given in Table 8.5.\n\nFigure 8.13 superimposes this equipment test level on the response during the eventual\nspacecraft acoustic test, showing how close the acoustic test response is to the equipment\n\nTable 8.4 Spacecraft acoustic environment for Ariane 5.

High frequency shock energy is attenuated very rapidly with distance from the\nsource and by structural joints between the shock source and the responding item. High\nfrequency shock is usually of more concern to the function of equipment such as relays\nor glass oscillators, rather than structural strength.\n\n\n\nANALYSIS 8.4 271\n\n100\n10\n\n100A\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(g\n\n) 1000\n\n10000\n\n1000 10000\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n100 Hz\n20 g\n\n400 Hz\n650 g\n\n665 Hz\n880 g\n\n1000 Hz\n2000 g\n\n10000 Hz\n2000 g\n\nFigure 8.14 Shock response spectrum at the separation plane. (Reproduced by\npermission of Arianespace)\n\n8.4.3 On-station requirements\n\nOn-station loads are of a much smaller magnitude than launch cases but they can be\nequally demanding on structure design. Structural transmission of micro-vibration from\nsources, such as momentum wheel bearing rumble or thruster firing, to sensitive equipment\nsuch as lasers or telescopes may be of critical concern.\n\nLarge appendages, such as antenna reflectors or solar array panels, may have a very\nlow natural frequency when deployed. A minimum deployed natural frequency between\n0.5\u20132 Hz is often required to avoid attitude control instability. Although a very low\nfrequency, this requirement may be difficult to meet. Consequently it may be critical in\nthe design of the deployed appendage interface and local backing structure.\n\nItems such as strut tubes and honeycomb core cells, when manufactured in atmospheric\npressure, could become inadvertent pressure vessels in the vacuum of space. They must\nbe vented, or if venting is not practicable, designed as a pressure vessel.\n\nAll non-metallic materials must be space-qualified, primarily with respect to out-gassing\nunder sun light in vacuum. The release of volatiles is doubly undesirable, since they\nmay degrade the performance of the residual material and may redeposit on adjacent\nsensitive equipment.\n\n8.4.4 Test loads\n\nTesting discussed in Section 8.5 will apply loads of greater magnitude than those encoun-\ntered in flight to give confidence that minor variations in load, material properties and\nbuild differences will not cause failure. Also, the test method may not be able to simulate\nthe conditions of flight exactly, and over-test in some areas may be necessary to ensure\nadequate testing in others.\n\n\n\n272 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nIt is essential that the structure designer has a clear test plan before the structure design\nis completed, to be sure that the structure is adequate for test as well as flight.\n\n8.4.5 Safety factors\n\nThe maximum load that can occur in service with worst weather conditions, roughest\nlaunch vehicle vibration and so on is termed the limit load . To be sure that structural\nstrength is not a concern at the time of launch the structure is designed and qualification-\ntested to levels in excess of the limit load. The first safety level above limit is the proof\nlevel . This is equal to limit load multiplied by a proof factor . The most frequently used\nproof factor is 1.1, but factors between 1.0 and 1.5 are also used. The structure must not\nsustain any significant permanent deformation once a proof load has been applied and\nremoved. The second safety level above limit is the ultimate level . A minimum ultimate\nsafety factor is 1.25 for Ariane 5. Factors up to 4.0 are used for some pressure vessels. The\nstructure must not rupture, collapse or undergo any gross permanent deformation under\nultimate load. A commonly used parameter to express the adequacy of a structure under\nthese failure criteria is the reserve factor . A reserve factor at any critical location is equal\nto the allowable load or stress divided by the applied load or stress. If the reserve factor\nis greater than 1.0 then the structure is adequate for purpose, judged by this particular\ncriterion. Another widely used term is margin of safety . A margin of safety is equal to the\nreserve factor minus 1.0. A positive margin of safety indicates adequacy, and a negative\none, inadequacy. In addition to the above safety factors, some safety agencies require\nminimum margins on particular failure modes. For example, a minimum margin of 0.25\nmay be required on first ply failure for composite materials or slender structure buckling.\nThe level of the safety factors may be seen as a measure of the mass criticality of the\nstructure versus the schedule and cost risk that a customer is prepared to take.\n\n8.4.6 Stiffness requirements\n\nTo be sure that the quasi-static and transient vibrations responses, discussed in the \u2018Sine\nvibration\u2019 subsection, do not exceed the levels indicated in the launch vehicle preliminary\ndesign manual, the spacecraft minimum natural frequency requirements must be well sep-\narated from those of the launch vehicle forcing functions. Table 8.6 gives the minimum\nfrequency requirements for spacecraft launched by Ariane 5. If these requirements are not\nmet, the spacecraft dynamic coupling with the launch vehicle will be stronger, causing the\nquasi-static loads and dynamic transients to increase. To satisfy these requirements, possi-\nble apportioned requirements are 30 = 80 Hz for fixed base major spacecraft appendages\nand 100 Hz for equipment. The spacecraft system designer will change these figures in\nconjunction with the corresponding quasi-static loads from the results of the spacecraft\nsine response analysis.\n\n8.4.7 Fracture control\n\nFracture control is required for ESA spacecraft and for pressure vessels in commercial\nspacecraft to satisfy launch range safety of expendable launch vehicles.\n\n\n\nANALYSIS 8.4 273\n\nTable 8.6 Minimum natural frequency of vibration requirements\n\nThe fundamental frequency in the lateral axis of a spacecraft hard-mounted\nat the interface must be as follows with an off-the-shelf adapter:\n\nS/C mass Launcher interface 1st fundamental Transverse inertia\n(kg) diameter lateral frequency wrt separation\n\n(mm) (Hz) plane (kg.m2)\n\n< 4500 < \u00d82624 ? 10 ? 50, 000\n\u00d82624 ? 9\n\n4500 ?

(Reproduced by\npermission of NASA)\n\n\n\n274 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nThe method requires a careful crack detection inspection. It is then assumed that cracks\nmay exist, in the most critical locations, at the crack detection limit of the method used.\nFigure 8.15 gives the detectable limit defined by NASA standards for dye penetrant inspec-\ntion of a semi-elliptical surface flaw. A standard initial flaw is one that can be detected\nby a competent trained inspector. A special initial flaw is one that can be detected by an\nexperienced inspector who has passes an examination by NASA or ESA representatives\nusing samples that contain known flaws.\n\nFracture control analysis uses a concept called stress intensity , which is equal to the\nstress, times a geometric factor for location, multiplied by the square root of the charac-\nteristic crack length. The whole essence of fracture mechanics is coupled to strain energy,\nstress concentration and material state [16].\n\nCrack propagation analysis is performed to predict the crack growth using empirical\ndata, which shows that a crack will grow a tiny amount every time a load or stress is\napplied and removed. No safety margin factor is applied to the load magnitude, but a safe\nlife factor of 4 is applied to the actual number of load cycles in the service spectrum to\nbe sure that a safe life margin exists. The structure is considered to be damage tolerant if\nthe crack does not grow to critical size after application of this load spectrum. A critical\ncrack is one that will give unstable growth when the limit load is applied once. Unstable\ngrowth will result if the applied stress intensity is greater than the material fracture\ntoughness. ESA has published a computer program with manual [17]. This based upon\na NASA program FLAGRO that embeds industry standard methods, data and techniques\nto perform safe life analyses.\n\n8.5 DESIGN VERIFICATION\n\nTest verification that a spacecraft meets its major strength and stiffness requirements will\nusually be required unless the safety margins are all greater than one or if the design is\nvery similar to a previously tested design. In the latter case, a qualification by similarity\nanalysis will demonstrate that the previous test covers the new assembly.\n\nThe major requirements to be test-verified are static strength, sine and acoustic vibration\nresponses and strength. A vibration test will also verify the accuracy of the mathemat-\nical model. Figure 8.16 shows the static test assembly for the Eurostar 3000 structure.\nProducing such an arrangement with adequate hydraulic loading jacks, their control sys-\ntems, recording strain gauges, displacement transducers and data logging systems is a\ncomplicated and expensive job. A dedicated test model is often used for this test because\nof the cut outs and load application points required specifically for the test. Load spreader\nplate attachments are used to diffuse load from the limited number of jacks into lightweight\nstructures, which in flight will carry a more distributed load.\n\nSine and acoustic tests may be performed on engineering models fitted with mass\ndummies. They are often performed as protoflight tests on flight hardware with all flight\nequipment fitted as part of the final Assembly, Integration and Verification process (see\nalso Chapter 17).\n\nVerification that the mathematical model is accurate may be obtained by comparing the\nsine response analysis with the spacecraft sine test results. There are several aspects to be\nconsidered here. Firstly, comparison of natural frequencies and mode shapes will ensure\nthat the model has the correct overall mass and stiffness. Comparing mode shape or the\nvariations of accelerations in any one particular mode of vibration will ensure that the\n\n\n\nDESIGN VERIFICATION 8.5 275\n\nFigure 8.16 Eurostar 3000 structure in the static test rig. (Reproduced by permission of\nEADS Astrium Ltd.)\n\nmodel represents the correct distribution of stiffness throughout the spacecraft. Comparing\nthe magnitude of response will ensure that the correct level of damping has been used.\n\nThere may be instances when errors may be present in the model, and modes of\nsimilar frequency cannot be separated by base excitation. Figure 8.17 illustrates a\npossible problem.\n\nThe left-hand Figure shows a second lateral mode of a spacecraft predicted at 60 Hz. The\nright-hand Figure shows a payload panel mode predicted at 70 Hz. On a base excitation\nsine test these could combine into a single mode at 65 Hz, making it impossible to isolate\nand correct the model error. It is in such instances that a multipoint modal survey test\nwould be helpful.\n\nFor a modal survey test, the spacecraft is attached to a seismic block. This is a large\nconcrete block mounted on springs or air bags in a pit to isolate the spacecraft from any\nextraneous ambient ground vibration generated by heavy factory equipment or passing\n\n\n\n276 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nTop floor\n\nService floor\n\nLower floor\n\nSecond lateral Payload panel\n\nCentral structure Central structure\n\nFigure 8.17 Vibration mode isolation by multipoint modal survey testing\n\nroad traffic. The spacecraft modes are excited individually by hand- or frame-held exciters\nat the positions indicated by the arrows. The frequency, phase, position and relative\nmagnitude of excitation are varied until a mode is isolated by trial and error. Having\nisolated the second lateral, the exercise can be repeated for the panel mode, so isolating\nand correcting the model error [18].\n\n8.6 IMPACT PROTECTION\n\nThe predicted growth of the millimetre and sub-millimetre size space debris environment,\nand the greater understanding of the meteoroid population, have led to a rise in interest in\nshielding for unmanned spacecraft in LEO. The impacts, typically in the range 5\u201320 km/s\nare capable of damaging and perforating spacecraft external structures [honeycomb panel,\noften covered by multilayered insulation (MLI)].\n\nA notable early strategy for shielding unmanned spacecraft was that developed for\nRadarsat [19]. The design changes effected\u2014re-routing of critical harnesses, enhancement\nof MLI using Nextel\u2014are included in the design recommendations made in the Orbital\nDebris Handbook [20].\n\nMore recently, similar enhanced MLI configurations have been tested for use on the\nIridium satellites and on the International Space Station (ISS) [21].\n\nTypically a space debris and meteoroid shield is based on a Whipple bumper. This\nconsists of a thin bumper shield of aluminium, metallic laminates or composite materials\nand a thicker aluminium back-up wall separated by a gap (s). The outer bumper layer\ndisrupts the projectile by either shattering, melting or vaporizing it. The spacing allows\nthe debris cloud to be distributed over a relatively large area, lowering the impact loading\non the back-up wall. Placing a range of materials between the bumper and back-up wall\n(Kevlar, MLI, Spectra, aluminium meshes and Nextel) can augment the shield. Multiple\nthin bumpers ensure that the projectile is repeatedly shocked (and thus fragmented, melted\nor vaporized) before impacting on the back-up wall. Figure 8.18 shows the three main\ntypes of shield.\n\nDifferent types of bumper material have been tested for their ability to disrupt the\nprojectile into a debris cloud. Metal and ceramic matrix composites were found to give\nbetter projectile disruption than the equivalent areal density aluminium bumper, resulting\nin less damage to the back-up wall. In addition to Kevlar and Nextel, honeycomb and\n\n\n\nIMPACT PROTECTION 8.6 277\n\nBumper\n\nBumper\n\n'Stuffing'\n(e.g. Nextel, Kevlar, MLI)\n\nMultiple bumpers\n(e.g. Nextel, Al mesh)\n\nBack-up wall\n\nBack-up wall\n\nBack-up wall\n\nStuffed whipple bumper shield\n\nMulti-shock shield\n\nWhipple bumper shield\n\nDebris cloud\n\nSpacing, s\n\ndp,v,?,rp, Shape\n\nFigure 8.18 Different types of Whipple bumper shields.

The apogee engine and\npressurant tank are fitted inside the primary load bearing CFRP filament wound central\ncone and cylinder assembly while propellant tanks are supported symmetrically around\nit. Main thrust axis inertia loads from the propellant tanks are carried to the launch\n\nFigure 8.19 Eurostar 3000 structure configuration.

This is a\nclassical use of carbon fibre\u2014the load direction is well defined and the construction lends\nitself to a well-controlled production process. Titanium alloy end fittings are used in this\napplication for their high strength. Steel fittings are used in the highest load missions to\nachieve the maximum strength in a confined geometric space. The flat panel configuration\nallows good access and logistics for separate panel integration at different sites by the\nremoval of sidewalls carrying whole systems. The solar cells are fitted to external arrays,\nleaving the side members of the spacecraft free for heat radiation from the high power\npayload equipment mounted on the inside of the exterior panels. A matrix of embedded\nand surface heat pipes are used to spread heat from local hot spots on these panels. The\nsolar arrays are rotated in GEO to ensure that they are always facing the Sun.\n\n8.7.2 Swarm\n\nThe three-point, bolted launch vehicle interface and the requirement to launch three space-\ncraft inside a launch vehicle fairing have led to the long narrow shape illustrated in\nFigure 8.20. An all carbon fibre composite structure has helped to minimize structure\nmass and magnetic interference for the Swarm mission, which is to measure fluctuations\nin the Earth\u2019s Magnetic field. Panel skins 0.48 mm thick, with plies biased towards an\naxial layup, are used at the base of the spacecraft with double thickness doublers at the\nlaunch vehicle attachment brackets. Skins 0.24 mm thick, with quasi-isotropic or nearly\nequal strength and stiffness properties in all directions, are used at the top of the space-\ncraft. All panels are of sandwich construction for compressive stability, and out-of-plane\nstiffness to accommodate attached equipment load-bearing. The exception is the spine\nlongeron which varies in thickness from 8 mm at the launch vehicle interface bracket\nattachment to 4 mm at the top boom interface.\n\n8.7.3 Lisa Pathfinder Propulsion Module\n\nThe Lisa Pathfinder Propulsion Module (PRM), shown in Figure 8.21, is based on the\nEurostar core structure, with the dual function of supporting propulsion equipment and a\nscience module. The relatively simple central thrust cone uses a filament wound carbon\nfibre composite cone of similar design but different geometry to the Eurostar structure\npreviously described. The outer box structure used by Eurostar to support, protect and\ntransmit heat from payload equipment is discarded and replaced by an exterior thermal\nblanket support structure. The all-CFRP science module (SCM), which gives good thermo-\nelastic stability to the instrument, separates from the PRM in the final approach to the\nLagrange point.\n\n8.7.4 BepiColombo\n\nFigure 8.22 shows the BepiColombo spacecraft configuration, which is an ESA mission to\nMercury. The structure comprises three modules with a total launch mass of 3000 kg. The\ninfluence of the purpose of each of these different modules can be seen in the design. The\nMercury Transfer Module (MTM) has a central cone to support the upper modules and\n\n\n\n280 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nFigure 8.20 Swarm structure configuration.

Note that the\nshear walls have been oriented to complete the shear flows to the outer box structure that\nsupport the higher mass equipment. The upper Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) is\na flat cylinder with a mass of 165 kg. A sun shield protects it from sun light and radiation\nwhile attached to the MPO. When orbiting independently it will measure the magnetic\nfield around Mercury. The MMO is spin stabilized, carrying louver protected radiators on\nits top and bottom surfaces while solar cells are mounted on its sides.\n\n8.7.5 The International Space Station (ISS)\n\nOn-orbit assembly of the ISS began in 1998 with the launch of Zarya.

(Reproduced by permission of\nEADS Astrium Ltd.)\n\n8.7.6 Mars express\n\nThis spacecraft configuration, illustrated in Figure 8.25, was designed to carry seven\ninstruments and one lander into Martian orbit.\n\nThe mission was a test case for the development of new working methods to speed\nup spacecraft production and to minimize mission costs. 116 kg was allowed for the\ninstruments and 60 kg for the lander. Off the shelf technology, or technology developed\nfor the Rosetta comet mission (see Chapter 5) was used wherever possible.\n\nThe instruments were accommodated within the spacecraft bus, an aluminium honey-\ncomb box 1.5 m long by 1.8 m wide by 1.4 m high. The lander, Beagle 2, was attached\nto the outside of the bus. Total mass of payload, lander, spacecraft and on-board fuel was\n1070 kg at launch.\n\n\n\n284 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nMost of the propulsive power needed to take Mars Express from Earth to Mars was\nprovided by the Soyuz Fregat launcher, which separated from the spacecraft after placing\nit on a Mars-bound trajectory. The spacecraft used its onboard propulsion to inject into\nMartian orbit and for orbit corrections. The spacecraft had two Eurostar 2000 bi-propellant\ntanks carrying a total of 427 kg of propellant at launch.\n\nFor up to six hours during the spacecraft\u2019s 7.5 h Martian orbit period, the high gain\nantenna is pointed towards Earth. During the remaining 1.5 h, the spacecraft points\ntowards Mars.\n\nThe spacecraft structure uses an arrangement of internal shear panels instead of a central\nthrust structure. This generated critical joints at the points where the shear walls cross\nthe circumference of the launch vehicle attachment ring, requiring substantial brackets at\nthese positions.\n\n8.7.7 Herschel\n\nThe Herschel Space Observatory is the largest infrared space observatory launched to\ndate. It is equipped with a 3.5 m diameter mirror, and instruments on an optical bench\n\nFigure 8.26 The Herschel spacecraft service module. (Reproduced by permission of\nESA)\n\n\n\nTHE FUTURE OF SPACE STRUCTURES 8.8 285\n\n(just below the mirror) which are housed in the central cryostat section that cools the\nbench close to absolute zero. The spacecraft is approximately 7.5 m high and 4 \u00d7 4 m in\noverall cross section, with a launch mass of around 3.4 tonnes. The bottom section of\nthe spacecraft shown in Figure 8.26 is the service module, which houses \u2018warm\u2019 service\nand payload equipment. Structural attachment to top and bottom of the cryostat is by a\ntruss of carbon fibre reinforced plastic struts which transmit all structural loads, while\nproviding thermal isolation and allowing thermo-elastic radial distortion relative to the\ncryostat. The payload module is fitted with a sunshield, which protects the telescope and\ncryostat from solar visible and infrared radiation and also prevents stray light from the\nEarth from entering the telescope. The sunshield also provides a mounting for the solar\narray for electrical power generation.\n\nIn summary, these examples illustrate the ambitious range and scale of projects cur-\nrently challenging the spacecraft designer. Most spacecraft structures are designed using\nflat panels, often honeycomb sandwich, or cylindrical and conical outer or inner shells.\nMouldings are used when complex shapes are advantageous. When selecting the space-\ncraft structure configuration to meet the requirements of any mission, the golden rule is\n\u2018keep it simple\u2019. Development of design and realization of detailed requirements as the\nproject progresses invariably increases complexity.\n\n8.8 THE FUTURE OF SPACE STRUCTURES\n\nAn examination of the history of structural design shows a progression to the more\nefficient use of materials. This trend will continue as load path assessments become more\nrefined and tailored application-specific, high strength materials are developed.\n\n8.8.1 Composite structures\n\nMaterial and manufacturing process improvements, for composites in particular, generally\nincrease specific strength and stiffness, while improved thermal stability for items such\nas optical benches is being achieved with carbon-carbon and ceramic materials.\n\nCarbon fibres derived from mesophase pitch give improved conductivity and modulus\nover standard carbon fibres derived from polyacrylonitrile (PAN), but they have lower\ncompressive strength. This is good for optical benches but can be a problem at joints in\nhighly loaded primary structures. Introducing carbon nanotubes into composite resins and\nadhesives or growing them onto the sides of carbon fibres improves thermal and electrical\nconductivity, strength and stiffness.\n\nDraping, weaving and stitching of fibres are being used to generate complex shapes\nwhich can be complemented by resin transfer moulding or a resin injection process.\n\nBy integrating systems into composite structures, we may approach the concept of the\nintelligent structure. Already optical fibres can be embedded into a carbon fibre matrix\nallowing signals to pass along skins. References [26, 27] are sources of information on the\ndeveloping field of electro-active and shape memory materials. Currently crude actuators\nare developed to sense and correct the onset of buckling.\n\n\n\n286 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURES\n\n8.8.2 Deployable structures\n\nInflatable structures that cure in orbit provide an interesting option for deployable struc-\ntures. Further development is needed to achieve satisfactory rigidity. Various techniques\nare being developed:\n\n\u2022 mechanical including kapton and aluminium laminates,\n\u2022 physical techniques including shape memory materials and solvent evaporation which\n\nsuffers from out-gassing problems,\n\u2022 chemical, thermal and/or UV curing,\n\u2022 cas catalysed polymers.\nPotentially the task of designing for launch can be made easier, since the structure\n\nmay be stowed compactly within the launch vehicle, and an extremely low mass may\nbe achieved, designed to withstand the zero g environment only when deployed. Careful\nconsideration needs to be given to loads created in hinges or members during automatic\nor remote deployment, where sections can build up momentum as they are swung into\nplace and are then suddenly stopped when positioned.\n\nA similar argument prevails for attitude control or orbit maintenance manoeuvres by the\nspace station. Not only are these likely to excite very low frequency cross-coupled oscilla-\ntions within the structure, but the designer is faced with a continuously changing situation\nas mass is added, moved or subtracted from the configuration. This is potentially a fertile\narea for the application of distributed thrusts and an \u2018expert system\u2019 or \u2018intelligent\u2019 attitude\ncontrol system to phase the individual firings to counter an undesirable dynamic response.\n\nIt can be expected that new families of wire tensioned structures will emerge that can\nonly be used in a zero g environment.\n\n8.8.3 Multiple spacecraft structures\n\nA greater diversity of structural design concepts is emerging. With the interest in small\nspacecraft for low Earth orbit constellations or small-scale, single experiments, the\ndesigner is required not only to produce an efficient structure to maximize payload\nbut also to respond to the ever-increasing commercial pressure of schedule and cost.\nMoulded, single component structures that can be stacked for multiple launches are an\nattractive proposition. The possibility of large numbers of spacecraft for the proposed\nglobal constellations (see Chapter 5) requires the design to encompass the needs of mass\nproduction, and ease of integration and test. The concept of six sigma is being explored\nto give more robust manufacturing methods. A six sigma process reduces the probability\nof defects occurring to less than 3.4 per million or six standard deviations above a 50%\nchance in a statistical normal distribution. As an example, bolted joints can be six sigma,\nwhile bonded joints will not. This is because there is significant scope for defects in the\nbond due to a range of possible causes.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Crane, F. A. and Charles, J. A.

Swinerd\n\nAeronautics and Astronautics, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment,\nUniversity of Southampton\n\n9.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough the prime purpose of the attitude control system (ACS) is to orientate the main\nstructure of the spacecraft correctly and to the required accuracy, it is worth considering\nit also as a momentum management system. Angular momentum is a commodity that can\nbe acquired and disposed of, or stored.\n\nIn terms of angular momentum management, the ACS designer must decide what his\nor her best policy is, and provide the hardware to achieve it. He or she will need to assess\nthe momentum implied by the pointing requirements set by the mission objectives, and\nto specify torquers and storage to provide it.\n\nWhen one looks at the types of ACS in existing spacecraft, it is found that a profusion\nof different methods are employed to meet this seemingly simple objective. The structures\nmay be spinning or not, or may be doing so only during certain phases of the mission.\nThe ACS may or may not use momentum bias and/or momentum storage; it may use\na variety of torquing methods, in combination or on their own. The number of options\nopen to the designer is large. What then influences the designer to select one solution as\nopposed to another?\n\nThe decisions that he or she makes are not based solely upon the considerations pre-\nsented here. The designer will be influenced by the experience and the history of the\ncompany in which he or she works. A feature of attitude control is that different technical\nsolutions may give very similar performance, and the designer will choose well-trodden\npaths, the type of solution of which his or her company has experience. And rightly so.\n\nThere are complete books on the subject of attitude dynamics and control [1\u20133], and\nthis solitary chapter cannot present a comprehensive account of the subject. The approach\nadopted is to look at the fundamentals, to progress from the system level downwards and\nto identify the design options. Detailed design is not covered.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W. Stark.\n\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n290 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\n9.2 ACS OVERVIEW\n\n9.2.1 The design objective\n\nThe orientation required of the spacecraft\u2019s structure will be determined by the mission.\nThe structure will be seen as the mounting base for the payload(s), and for several\n\u2018housekeeping\u2019 subsystems that have objects that must be pointed in specific directions.\nAmong the latter will be solar arrays to be pointed at the Sun, thermal radiators to be\npointed at deep space, antennas to be pointed at ground stations and, prior to firing,\nthrusters to be pointed in the correct direction. Add to this the pointing requirement of\nthe payload and it can be seen that there is an essentially three-dimensional problem to\nsolve, at the end of which will emerge a proposed layout for the spacecraft with locations\nfor the objects to be pointed and a specification for the orientation of their mounting base,\nthe main structure.\n\nThe required orientation will frequently be related to an Earth-based frame of reference,\nsuch as, \u2018One face of the spacecraft must point down the local vertical\u2019. The ACS designer\nmust then analyse the orbit and the mission in order to assess the motion that is required of\nthe structure and the disturbance torques to which it will be subjected. For this objective,\nthe structure requires an angular rate equal to ?? , where ? is the true anomaly. (See\nSection 4.2 and Figure 4.3 of Chapter 4.)\n\nThere will often be several alternative configurations that will meet the overall objective\nfor a given payload, and these may pose very different problems. The Intelsat series of\nsatellites illustrates this point. Their payloads are all for communications purposes and\nhave antennas to be pointed at locations on the Earth. But their configurations include\nspinners, dual-spin and three-axis-stabilized types.\n\nIn general, pointing mechanisms are to be avoided. However, they are often needed in\norder to enable an object to remain pointing in one direction whilst the main structure\nchanges its orientation, or vice versa . For example, a solar array needs to remain pointing\nat the Sun whilst the main structure turns to align with the local vertical.\n\nThe required accuracy of orientation will be set by the payload. The accuracy with\nwhich its direction can be controlled will be less than that to which it can be measured,\nand this is in line with the requirement. For example, astronomers will need to know\nwhere a space telescope\u2019s axis is pointing to great accuracy (typically arc seconds), but\nthe control of its direction may be less accurate, related to its field of view.\n\nA full accuracy specification for both measurement and control of the main structure\u2019s\nattitude may then be determined from the various pointing requirements.\n\n9.2.2 Mission-related system considerations\n\nThe ACS designer will need to know the required time-history of the rotational motion,\nthe angular rate ? which is required of the spacecraft, and of any parts of it that can\nmove independently on bearings. The angular momentum Hc and the torque T needed\nto produce it may then be calculated from the Newtonian law (from equation 3.28 of\nChapter 3):\n\ndHc/dt = T (9.1)\n\n\n\nACS OVERVIEW 9.2 291\n\nwhere Hc is the angular momentum referred to the centre-of-mass C , detailed in\nequations (3.33) to (3.36) of Chapter 3, and T is the torque.\n\nA circular orbit provides an interesting example. The local vertical will rotate at a\nconstant rate equal to 1 revolution per orbit about the normal to the orbit plane. If one\nface of a structure with no momentum bias is required to point down the vertical, then no\ntorque is needed to maintain this condition provided that a principal axis is aligned with\nthe normal to the orbit plane. If the normal is not a principal axis, then equation (9.1)\nwill indicate that a cyclic torque is needed.\n\nFor an elliptical orbit, on the other hand, the local vertical will not have a constant\nangular velocity. An assessment over one orbit indicates that the angular rate will vary as\nshown in Figure 9.1. It has a cyclic variation about a mean level of one revolution per orbit.\n\nIf one face of the structure is required to point down the vertical and a principal axis\nis aligned with the normal to the orbit plane, then no torque is needed to maintain the\nmean angular rate (constant angular momentum). But torques will be needed to produce\nthe fluctuations in momentum about the mean value.\n\nIf the structure is not rotating , frequently the case for astronomical missions, then again\nno torque is needed to maintain this condition once it has been achieved. This will be\napproximately true of solar arrays too, since their angular velocity is likely to be virtually\nzero as they point towards the Sun, even if the main structure is rotating.\n\nThe torque requirements for each part of the spacecraft may be assessed as above,\non the assumption that it is rigid, and these will be the minimum torques needed. Extra\ntorques will be required in order to combat the uncontrolled (disturbance) torques such\nas that due to solar radiation pressure (SRP), movement of fuel, mechanisms, friction in\nbearings and so on, and so these must be evaluated too (see Section 9.4). The assessment\nmust cover all phases of the mission, and all three axes of the spacecraft.\n\nIt may be expected that the largest torques will be needed during the early stages,\nbetween final separation and being on station. The maximum torque capability will\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0.5 1.0\nTime (fractions of an orbital period)\n\nA\npo\n\nge\ne\n\nP\ner\n\nig\nee\n\nE\ncc\n\nen\ntr\n\nic\nity\n\n v\nal\n\nue\ns\n\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nA\nng\n\nul\nar\n\n r\nat\n\ne \n(r\n\nad\ns \n\npe\nr \n\nor\nbi\n\nta\nl p\n\ner\nio\n\nd)\n\nFigure 9.1 Angular rate of the local vertical for satellites in elliptical orbits\n\n\n\n292 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\ngovern the time taken to execute manoeuvres such as the repointing manoeuvres shown in\nFigure 9.7. If manoeuvre times are important, then these may determine the specification\nfor this feature of the torquers.\n\nMomentum storage will normally be provided on spacecraft of medium to large size,\nespecially when there is a requirement for fluctuating torque or momentum or when\nthere are tight tolerances on pointing accuracy (see Table 9.2). A momentum storage\ndevice is basically a wheel fitted with a torque motor, each enabling one component of\nmomentum to be stored (but see Section 9.4.7). On small satellites they are less likely\nto be used because of their mass and cost, attitude control then being achieved by using\nexternal torquers.\n\nIn operation, the wheel torque motor will be the prime means of achieving the pointing\nrequirement of the structure, correcting any errors, however caused, in a feedback sense.\nIn so doing, it will insert or extract momentum from the wheel. When the wheel reaches an\nextreme of its permitted range of speeds\u2014its store of momentum has been filled\u2014then its\nspeed must be restored to its normal value, using external torquers to counter the torque on\nthe wheel so as to maintain attitude control. This process is known as momentum dumping .\n\nAssessment of the required amount of storage will be based upon the mission, and it\nwill be chosen to achieve infrequent use of the dumping process. Orbit considerations\nsuch as its eccentricity, imply rotation as shown in Figure 9.1, for example, and a\nmomentum component (I ?) along the normal to the orbit plane. Dumping will be\nrequired during every orbit unless the store can accommodate at least half of the\ndifference between the maximum and the minimum values of I ?. In addition, it must\naccommodate consequential momentum arising from disturbance torques. Table 9.1\nshows a list of the potential sources of these.\n\nManoeuvres such as the repointing one shown in Figure 9.7 must also be assessed in\na similar way.\n\nTable 9.1 Disturbance torques\n\nExternal torques Height range over which\nsource it is potentially dominant\n\nAerodynamic <about 500 km?\nMagnetic 500\u201335 000 km\nGravity gradient 500\u201335 000 km\nSolar radiation >700 km?\nThrust misalignment all heights\n\nInternal torques source\n\nMechanisms\nFuel movement\nAstronaut movement\nFlexible appendages\nGeneral mass movement\n\n?Values depend upon the level of solar activity.\n\n\n\nACS OVERVIEW 9.2 293\n\n9.2.3 Momentum bias\n\nThe level of momentum that is involved in a storage system will be quite small, and much\nsmaller than will bring any significant benefit from gyroscopic rigidity. This will come\nfrom momentum bias , which makes the direction of one axis of the spacecraft highly\nresistant to change. (See Section 3.4 of Chapter 3.)\n\nFor example, if the mission requires that one axis of the spacecraft shall always lie in\nthe direction of the normal to the orbit plane, or at right angles to the Sun vector, then the\ndesigner might include momentum bias in that direction. The magnitude of the bias, Hb,\nwhilst not critical, is likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the storage system\nwill handle. A torque T at right angles to it will cause the axis to precess at a rate T /Hb\n(see equation 3.29 of Chapter 3). The attitude response about the bias direction will not\nbe altered.\n\nMomentum bias devices may be used for momentum storage too. If more than one bias\ndevice is used, and this may well be done in order to enhance the reliability, then it must\nbe remembered that their momenta add vectorially to produce only one gyroscopically\nrigid axis.\n\n9.2.4 The ACS block diagram\n\nThe block diagram in Figure 9.2 shows the major components of a general ACS system.\nThe links between components identify major interactions, with arrows indicating that\nthere is a cause\u2013effect relationship; it is convenient to think of them as channels along\n\nS/C\n\nTorque\ndemands\n\nMeasured\nattitude\n\nAttitude\n\nDisturbances\n\nTorques\nControl\ntorquers\n\nGround\ncontrol\n\nOn-board\ncomputer Attitude \n\nsensors\n\nFigure 9.2 Block diagram for an attitude-control system\n\n\n\n294 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nwhich information flows. For example, the main structure of the spacecraft is subjected\nto time-varying torques from torquers, and will respond with attitude motion that will be\ndetected by the sensors. Outputs from these will be sent to computers, on-board and at\nthe ground control station, and the information will be used to determine the torques that\nshould be applied to the structure.\n\n9.3 THE SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE RESPONSE\n\nIn the context of the ACS block diagram, the spacecraft may be seen as an object that\nchanges its orientation in response to a torque, which is the simple message conveyed in\nFigure 9.2. The way in which it responds will depend upon whether it has momentum\nbias, and the response equations are contained in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of Chapter 3.\n\nWhilst the decision to include bias and the method of doing so will be decided at\nsystem level (see Section 9.2), it is as well to recall the main types of structure and their\ncharacteristics with which ACS designer will have to deal. For each type, he or she will\nbe concerned with the following:\n\n\u2022 the equilibrium state,\n\u2022 the response to a steady torque,\n\u2022 the stability, and the existence of any oscillatory modes.\n\n9.3.1 The three-axis-stabilized spacecraft\n\n(with no momentum bias)\n\nThe dynamic equations for this spacecraft, treated as a rigid body, are covered in\nSection 3.4.1 of Chapter 3, using principal axes for the analysis. With small angular veloc-\nities the responses about these axes are largely uncoupled and may be approximated by\n\nIxx ??x = Tx , Iyy ??y = Ty , Izz ??z = Tz (9.2)\n\nEach of these equations corresponds to a root location diagram? having a single root at\nthe origin, as shown in Figure 9.6(a).\n\nAny of the torque components on its own will produce an acceleration about its own\naxis. Combinations, however, will not do so; they will produce a cross-coupled response\nexcept when the moments of inertia are equal. Cross-couplings will increase as the angular\nvelocity increases.\n\nThis type of spacecraft usually has flexible solar arrays attached to the main structure\nas shown in Figure 9.3, with lightly damped flexure modes with a low fundamental\nfrequency. When selecting the algorithms for the ACS computer, up to about 20 of these\nmodes may be mathematically modelled, in order to ensure ideally that they are stabilized,\nbut at least that they are not destabilized.\n\nAnother typical configuration for this type is that of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n? A root location diagram is an Argand diagram on which is marked the root(s) of the Characteristic Equation of\na linear differential equation.\n\n\n\nTHE SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE RESPONSE 9.3 295\n\nFigure 9.3 Typical configuration of a three-axis stabilized spacecraft\n\n9.3.2 Pure-spin spacecraft\n\nThe dynamics of a spinner are covered in Section 3.4.2 of Chapter 3. It is assumed here that\nthe whole vehicle is spinning about its z -axis with an angular rate S , and that its mass dis-\ntribution is axially symmetric so that Ixx = Iyy . A typical \u2018spinner\u2019 is shown in Figure 9.4.\nThe response to a torque will be of interest in one or both of the two sets of axes.\n\nThe response in axes fixed in the structure will be of interest when the torque components\nare in these axes or when the attitude sensors measure components in these axes. The\nequations, developed from equation (3.40) of Chapter 3, are\n\nIxx ??x + S ?y (Izz ? Ixx ) = Tx\nIxx ??y ? S ?x (Izz ? Ixx ) = Ty (9.3)\n\nIzz S? = Tz\nSeparating ?x from ?y leads to\n\nIxx (??x + ?2nut?x ) = T?x ? ?nutTy and Ixx (??y + ?2nut?y ) = T?y + ?nutTx (9.4)\n\nwhere ?nut = S [(Izz /Ixx ) ? 1] is the frequency (rads/s) of the nutation mode referred to\nin Section 3.4.2 of Chapter 3, when observed in the spacecraft\u2019s axes. This mode will\nneed to be damped, whereupon the eventual constant components ?x , ?y in response to\nconstant torques Tx , Ty will become\n\n?x = ?Ty/S (Izz ? Ixx ) and ?y = Tx/S (Izz ? Ixx ) (9.5)\n\nWhen these are combined with the spin motion, the result is a coning rotation of the\nz -axis at the spin frequency S when viewed from outside the spacecraft.\n\nOne of the major reasons for spinning a spacecraft is to counter the effect upon the\ntrajectory that is caused by a thrust offset when a high-thrust motor is being used, such as\nduring orbit-changing manoeuvres. Ideally, it is assumed that the thrust vector will pass\n\nFigure 9.4 Typical configuration of a pure-spin spacecraft\n\n\n\n296 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nthrough the centre-of-mass along the z -axis. Equations (9.4) indicate that the torque due\nto an offset will then cause coning and spinning, which is acceptable, with an average\nthrust in the correct direction.\n\nThe z -component of torque Tz produces an acceleration about that axis, which is uncou-\npled from the other two axes.\n\nThe response in non-spinning axes will be of interest when the spin axis has to be\nredirected and when the reason for spinning the structure is to provide gyroscopic rigidity\nvia momentum bias. One of the axes is aligned with the spin axis (z -axis); the x - and\ny-axes do not rotate with the structure. The response equations become (see equations 3.47\nof Chapter 3)\n\nIxx ??x + Izz S ?y = Tx\nIxx ??y ? Izz S ?x = Ty (9.6)\n\nIzz S? = Tz\nConstant torque components Tx , Ty produce precessional angular rate components\n\n?x = ?Ty/Izz S , ?y = Tx/Izz S (9.7)\n\nThese are the rotations that will be observed from outside the spacecraft, and they demon-\nstrate gyroscopic rigidity in that as the bias (IzzS ) increases, so the response to a given\ntorque decreases. The nutation mode, observed in these non-spinning axes, has frequency\n\n?nut = S (Izz /Ixx ) (9.8)\n\nand will need to be damped (see Section 9.3.4).\nThe root location diagrams corresponding to equations (9.3) and (9.6) are shown in\n\nFigure 9.6. The response of the spin-rate S corresponds to a single root at the origin,\nexactly the same as that for all the principal axes in the case when there is no momentum\nbias (equation 9.2). On the other hand the equations for the components ?x , ?y generate\na pair of (oscillatory) roots at \u00b1jS ((Izz /Ixx ) ? 1); the corresponding components ?x , ?y\nin non-spinning axes generate roots at \u00b1jS (Izz /Ixx ). These represent the nutation mode\n(Section 3.5.1 of Chapter 3).\n\n9.3.3 Hybrid and dual-spin spacecraft\n\nThe dynamics of these craft are covered in Section 3.4.3 of Chapter 3. In the dual-spin\nversion, momentum bias is provided by rotating a piece of structure on a bearing\nattached to the non-spinning part; it will be assumed that the spinning part has an axially\nsymmetric mass distribution (see Figure 9.5).\n\nIn the hybrid spacecraft, the bias is provided by a momentum wheel (MW) (see\nSection 9.4.7).\n\n\n\nTHE SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE RESPONSE 9.3 297\n\nFigure 9.5 Typical configuration of a dual-spin spacecraft\n\nThe response equations for these types of spacecraft, with their bias Hz along the z -axis,\nare equations (3.57) of Chapter 3. For low body rates, they approximate to\n\nIxx ??x + Hz ?y = Tx\nIyy ??y ? Hz ?x = Ty (9.9)\n\nIzz ??z + H?z = Tz\n\nConstant torque components Tx , Ty produce precessional angular rates:\n\n?x = ?Ty/Hz , ?y = Tx/Hz (9.10)\n\nThe torque component Tz about the bias direction produces an acceleration response\nabout that direction, which does not cross-couple into the other axes. In the case of\nMWs, the total bias may be the vector sum of the biases from three or more wheels in\ndifferent directions; nevertheless it is the component of torque in the total bias direction\nthat produces the acceleration response described above.\n\nThe nutation mode has a frequency\n\n?nut = Hz /\n?\n\n(Ixx Iyy ) (9.11)\n\nand needs to be damped (see Section 9.3.4).\nThe root location diagrams for spacecraft with momentum bias, referred to non-\n\nspinning axes (equations 9.9) are shown in Figures 9.6. Motion about the z -axis\u2014the\nbias direction\u2014in response to Tz , has a single root at the origin as in Figure 9.6(a).\n\nThe coupled motion about the x - and y-axes in response to Tx and/or Ty has (in\nFigure 9.6b) two roots representing the nutation roots. As the amount of bias decreases\nto zero, the roots move to the origin, as in Figure 9.6(a).\n\nReorientation manoeuvres in response to torques will differ depending upon whether the\nmanoeuvre changes the direction of the momentum bias, and will depend upon whether\nthe torquer is an On/Off device or whether its magnitude is controllable.\n\n\n\n298 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nImag.\n\nReal\n\n(a)\n\nImag.\n\nReal\n\n(b)\n\njwnut\n\n?jwnut\n\nFigure 9.6 Root location diagrams: (a) ?z in response to Tz ; (b) ?x , ?y in response to\nTx , Ty\n\nTorque pulses to produce a manoeuvre about a bias direction\u2014or about any principle\naxis if there is no bias\u2014may be achieved by torque pulses as shown in Figure 9.7(b).\n\nTorque pulses used to change a bias direction\u2014the z -axis of the pure-spinner, dual-\nspinner and hybrid spacecraft\u2014will only produce a change of direction whilst the torque\nacts. At its start and at its termination it will excite the nutation mode as shown in\nFigure 9.7(a). A torque pulse lasting for an integer number of periods of the nutation\noscillation will cancel the oscillation when it ceases.\n\nTorquers whose torque magnitude is controllable admit the possibility of avoiding\nexcitation of the nutation mode. The cross-coupling between pitch and yaw that is char-\nacteristic of the mode can be cancelled by introducing cross-coupling in the computer\nalgorithms that control the torquers. Reference [4] shows how the technique of complex\nsummation of the Tx and Ty equations can lead to a suitable algorithm when the spacecraft\nis axisymmetric.\n\n9.3.4 Oscillatory modes\n\nA characteristic of the space environment is that oscillatory modes have very little\ndamping. The ACS has to avoid undue excitation of these and must include means of\ndamping them. Damping may be enhanced by means of energy dissipation or by active\ncontrol techniques.\n\nThe energy dissipation method is based upon the fact that the energy present in an\noscillatory mode is exchanged between kinetic and potential types during each cycle. A\nconstant total amount corresponds to a constant amplitude of oscillation that is proportional\nto the square root of the energy. By using the oscillation to excite an energy dissipator, the\namplitude will decrease and the mode becomes damped. Active damping entails sensing\nthe oscillation and applying a suppressing torque in the correct phase.\n\nNutation damping may be implemented either way. A passive damper may consist\nsimply of a metallic tube containing a viscous fluid. The fluid is chosen to have a\nnearly constant viscosity over a wide range of temperatures keeping it from solidify-\ning at low temperatures. A variety of fluids have been used, including alcohol and freon.\n\n\n\nTHE SPACECRAFT ATTITUDE RESPONSE 9.3 299\n\nTime (s)\n\n16\n.2\n\n15\n.6\n\n14\n.4\n\n13\n.8\n\n13\n.2\n\n12\n.6\n\n11\n.4\n\n10\n.8\n\n10\n.29.\n6\n\n8.\n4\n\n7.\n8\n\n7.\n2\n\n6.\n6\n\n5.\n4\n\n4.\n8\n\n4.\n2\n\n3.\n6\n\n2.\n4\n\n1.\n8\n\n1.\n2\n\n0.\n6 15129630\n\n0\n\nInitial\ndirection\n\nTorque pulses\n\nSpacecraft spin axis directions\n\nTarget direction\nMomentum bias axis\n                  directions\n\n(a)\n\n16\n.8\n\n16\n.215\n\n14\n.4\n\n13\n.8\n\n13\n.2\n\n12\n.6\n\n11\n.4\n\n10\n.8\n\n10\n.298.\n4\n\n7.\n8\n\n7.\n2\n\n6.\n6\n\n5.\n4\n\n4.\n8\n\n4.\n2\n\n3.\n6\n\n2.\n4\n\n1.\n8\n\n1.\n2\n\n0.\n6\n\n15\n.6129.\n63 60\n\n0\n\nInitial\ndirection\n\n(b)\n\nTime (s)\n\nTarget direction\n\nTorque pulses\n\nCoasting phase\n\nSpacecraft axis direction\n\nFigure 9.7 Torque responses: (a) repointing a momentum bias axis and (b) repointing\nabout a principal axis, with no momentum bias\n\nThe geometry of the tube is often a ring, and it is mounted at a location to ensure a\ngood coupling with the nutational motion. When nutation occurs, the frictional force\nbetween the fluid and the tube introduces energy dissipation that dampens the nutational\nmode. For the long-term stability of the dual-spin spacecraft, it should be mounted in the\nnon-spinning part. (see Section 3.4.3 of Chapter 3.)\n\n\n\n300 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nActive damping may be achieved by applying a torque component proportional to the\nangular velocity component along the same axis, that is, Tx proportional to ?x . The axes\nmay be the spinning (body) axes or non-spinning ones. For the hybrid and dual-spin\nspacecraft, equations (9.9) then become\n\nIxx ??x + Hz ?y = Tx = ?Kx?x\nIyy ??y ? Hz ?x = Ty = ?Ky?y (9.12)\n\nwhere Kx , Ky are the feedback constants expressing the torque per unit angular rate.\nThe characteristic equation, in terms of the Laplace operator s , is\n\nIxx Iyy s\n2 + (Ixx Ky + IyyKx )s + (Kx Ky + H 2z ) = 0 (9.13)\n\nThis represents damped harmonic motion when Kx and/or Ky are non-zero and positive.\nIn practice, there will be other oscillatory modes present, and excited by the same\n\ntorquers. These may be separated into the so-called rigid-body ones, and those associated\nwith mass movement and flexure, as described in Section 3.5.2 of Chapter 3. The math-\nematical modelling covered in this chapter is restricted to the rigid body and thus will\ncover nutation and libration but not the other modes. A more comprehensive coverage is\ngiven in References [1] and [2].\n\n9.3.5 Summary of attitude response\n\nThe ACS is a feedback system in which the spacecraft is the plant, shown as a block\nin a block diagram (Figure 9.2) in which torque affects attitude. The dynamic equations\nlinking these are presented in Chapter 3, and above they are shown when the torque\ncomponents are about the principal axes.\n\nWhilst the torques will excite oscillatory modes, and these must ultimately be stable,\ntheir prime purpose is to control the orientation of the axes of the spacecraft. Each\ncomponent of torque will have an effect, and by resolving into principal axes, their\neffects are largely uncoupled from each other. These simple responses to each separate\ncomponent of torque are useful to be preserved as the dominant responses of the block.\nThere are just two types\u2014the precessional and the non-precessional. Figure 9.7 illustrates\ntypical responses to torque pulses in order to achieve repointing in these two cases.\n\nThe non-precessional response shown in Figure 9.7(b) obeys, for example,\n\nIxx ??x = Ixx ?? = Tx (9.14)\n\nThe rotational response is an angular acceleration about the same principal axis as the\ntorque. This applies to each axis when there is no momentum bias, but applies only to\nmotion about the bias axis when it is present.\n\nThe precessional response, approximated by omitting the nutation mode, is the steady-\nstate response, which is given by:\n\n?y = ?? = Tx/Hz and ?x = ?? = ?Ty/Hz (9.15)\n\n\n\nTORQUES AND TORQUERS 9.4 301\n\nThe response equations with nutation included, in state-space form, are\n\nd/dt\n\n?\n???\n\n?x\n?y\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n??? =\n\n?\n???\n\n0 ?Hz /Ixx 0 0\nHz /Iyy 0 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n???\n\n?x\n?y\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n??? +\n\n?\n???\n\n1/Ixx 0\n0 1/Iyy\n0 0\n0 0\n\n?\n???\n\n[\nTx\nTy\n\n]\n(9.16)\n\nwhere ?? ? ?y and ?? ? ?x .\n\n9.4 TORQUES AND TORQUERS\n\nThe torques, arising from moments of forces about the centre-of-mass, must be identified\nas being external or internal to the spacecraft. The former will affect its total angular\nmomentum, whereas the latter will affect only the distribution of momentum between its\nmoving parts. The case has already been made that it is necessary to include controllable\nexternal torquers whereas internal ones, with their momentum storage facility, are optional\n(see Section 3.3.2 of Chapter 3).\n\nThe main sources of torques, occurring either naturally or as disturbances, are intro-\nduced below and summarized in Table 9.1. The magnitude of torques in space is small\nwhen compared with terrestrial standards. Even very small ones become significant when\nthere is no friction to oppose them and when the orientation has to be very accurate.\n\nSome of the phenomena listed as disturbance torques in Table 9.1 may be used as a\nmeans of achieving the required orientation of the spacecraft. For this, they will normally\nneed to be controllable; a possible exception is the gravity-gradient torque, which will\nestablish an Earth-facing equilibrium orientation passively, with the axis of least inertia\nalong the local vertical (see Section 9.4.3).\n\nTable 9.2 summarizes the main advantages and disadvantages of various types\nof torquer.\n\n9.4.1 Thrusters (external type)\n\nOrbit-changing thrusters provide potentially the largest source of force on spacecraft, and\npotentially the largest source of torque. Being external, the torque will affect the total\nmomentum. Ideally, the thrust vector passes through the centre-of-mass, but inevitably\nthere is a tolerance on this and consequently a disturbance torque arises.\n\nThe main means of countering the effects of this torque when large thrust levels are\npresent are either to spin the vehicle about the intended thrust direction (cf. Section 9.3.2)\nor to provide means of controlling the achieved thrust direction. At lift-off, for example,\nthe latter method must clearly be used. This involves mounting some of the thrusters\nin gimbals, or using secondary fuel injection into the rocket nozzle, and controlling the\nthrust direction so as to achieve the required trajectory. Later stages of the flight of booster\nrockets may adopt the alternative method of spinning the vehicle in order to average out\nthe effect of thrust offset upon the trajectory. Thruster firings used for changing the orbit,\nsuch as from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Transfer Orbit, and again from Transfer Orbit\n\n\n\n302 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nTable 9.2 Types of torquer\n\nType Advantages Disadvantages\n\nExternal types Can control momentum build-up\n\nGas jets Insensitive to altitude Requires fuel\nSuit any orbit On-off operation only\nCan torque about any axis Has minimum impulse\n\nExhaust plume contaminants\nMagnetic No fuel required No torque about the local field\n\ndirectionTorque magnitude is\ncontrollable Torque is altitude and latitude\n\nsensitive\nCan cause magnetic\n\ninterference\nGravity gradient No fuel or energy needed No torque about the local\n\nvertical\nLow accuracy\nLow torque, altitude sensitive\nLibration mode needs damping\n\nSolar radiation No fuel required Needs controllable panels\nVery low torque\n\nInternal types No fuel required Cannot control momentum\nbuild-upCan store momentum\n\nTorque magnitude is controllable\n\nReaction wheels (RW) Continuous, fine-pointing capability Non-linearity at zero speed\nMomentum wheels\n\n(MWs)\nProvide momentum bias\n\nControl moment\ngyroscope (CMG)\n\nSuitable for three-axis control Complicated\nProvides momentum bias Potential reliability problem\n\nto Geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), are sometimes preceded by a spin-up manoeuvre,\nfollowed by de-spin after the orbit changes are complete.\n\nThrusters with very much lower levels of thrust are in common use in attitude-control\nsystems for providing controllable external torquing, and hence controlling the total\nmomentum of the spacecraft. For this purpose, they will be mounted in clusters on the\nsurface of the vehicle, pointing in different directions in order to provide three compo-\nnents of torque. They have a number of advantages and disadvantages compared with\ntheir main rival, the magnetic torquer.\n\nTheir main advantage is that their torque level is independent of altitude and there\nis potentially no limit to its magnitude. However, the magnitude is not controllable\nwhen installed; only the switch-on duration. This torquing system integrates well with\nthe station-keeping requirement for thrusters, since a common fuel and control system\ncan be used.\n\nThrusters have a number of disadvantages. If they are used as the prime means of\norientating a spacecraft, their restriction to an on\u2013off type of control leads to a limit\ncycle occurring, a similar process to that occurring in station-keeping manoeuvres (see\n\n\n\nTORQUES AND TORQUERS 9.4 303\n\nSections 5.6.3 and 5.6.4 of Chapter 5) but with a much shorter period. If they are used\nto achieve accurate pointing, then the torquers will need to provide small and consistent\nimpulses, and their minimum switch-on time of several milliseconds leads to a low maxi-\nmum torque being needed. Typically a minimum thrust impulse of order 10?4 Ns may be\nrequired, with a thrust level as low as 10?2 N. When the prime means of attitude control\nis a reaction wheel or momentum wheel (Section 9.4.7), then thrusters may be used for\nmomentum dumping. In this case, their thrust level will be higher than that stated above,\nand they may be used perhaps only once every several orbits.\n\nA variety of thruster systems may be used, ranging from cold gas to electric propulsion,\nas indicated in Sections 6.3 and 6.4 of Chapter 6.\n\nThe fact that thrusters use fuel is another disadvantage. Although a large amount of\nfuel is not normally needed for attitude control it will eventually be exhausted, and a\nnumber of spacecraft have reached the end of their useful life because of this.\n\n9.4.2 Magnetic torque (external type)\n\nThe magnetic field generated by a spacecraft interacts with the local field from the Earth\nand thereby exerts an external couple on the vehicle. This is a similar effect to that of\na compass needle that attempts to align itself with the local direction of the field. If the\nspacecraft\u2019s magnetism is represented as a dipole whose magnetic moment is m, then it\nreacts with the local flux density B to produce a torque T given by\n\nT = m \u00d7 B (9.17)\n\nCare must be taken that electric currents and spurious magnetic effects do not cause a\nsignificant disturbance torque (see Chapter 16).\n\nElectromagnets may be used to provide a controllable external torque. Their strength\ncan be controlled by means of the current I . Their reaction with a local field B leads to\nthe couple:\n\nT = nIA(c? \u00d7 B) (9.18)\n\nwhere\nn is the number of turns\nA is the cross-sectional area of the coil,\nc? is the unit vector in the direction of the coil\u2019s axis.\n\nRod-like electromagnets will normally be used, such as those shown in Figure 9.8. A\nrange of strengths is available to suit the mission requirements, and they may be used in\nan on\u2013off or a proportional control manner, for attitude control or momentum dumping.\n\nThree orthogonal magnets enable the direction and magnitude of the dipole to be\ncontrolled. Their mounting locations should be away from instruments that are sensitive\nto magnetic fields and separate from each other in order to avoid cross-coupling.\n\nMagnetic torquers are in common use in satellites orbiting at altitudes up to geosta-\ntionary altitude, but their utility decreases at the higher altitudes since the strength of the\nEarth\u2019s field reduces with height. The field\u2019s strength and direction also vary with the\n\n\n\n304 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nFigure 9.8 Magnetic torquers. The three torque rods shown are those used on the\nEURECA spacecraft, and are each in excess of a metre in length. (Reproduced by\npermission of Dutch Space BV)\n\nposition of the spacecraft in its orbit in general, and when using magnetic torquers it is\ncommon practice to carry a magnetometer to measure the local field.\n\nA feature of magnetic torquers is that they cannot produce a torque component about\nthe local field direction. In a polar orbit, any required torque direction can always be\nachieved at some point in the orbit since the field direction changes round the orbit.\nIn the equatorial plane, however, the field lines always lie horizontally, north\u2013south.\nConsequently a spacecraft whose orbit lies in this plane cannot use magnetic torquers\nto counteract the north\u2013south component of their disturbance torque, or to dump this\ncomponent of momentum. A reorientation about the north\u2013south direction is achievable\nnevertheless, by a rotation of the torque vector about this direction. In the resulting coning\nmotion, the reorientation will slowly take place.\n\nAn advantage of magnetic torquers is that they require no fuel and so have virtually\nunlimited life. They do of course require electrical power. But there is no exhaust pollutant\nand by providing a couple they are not sensitive to movement of the centre-of-mass.\n\n\n\nTORQUES AND TORQUERS 9.4 305\n\n9.4.3 Gravity-gradient torque (external type)\n\nThis source of torque occurs because in a gravitational field that gets weaker with increase\nin height, a body will only be in stable equilibrium if its axis of minimum inertia is aligned\nwith the local vertical.\n\nThe gravitational force dF on an increment of mass dm is\n\ndF = ? dm\nr2\n\n(9.19)\n\nwhere\n? is the Earth\u2019s gravitational constant = 0.3986 \u00d7 1015m3/s2,\nr is the distance from the Earth\u2019s centre.\n\nBy summing the moments about the centre-of-mass C , the torque components may be\nshown to be\n\nTx = (3?/2r3)(Izz ? Iyy) sin 2? cos2 ?\nTy = (3?/2r3)(Izz ? Ixx ) sin 2? cos ? (9.20)\nTz = (3?/2r3)(Ixx ? Iyy) sin 2? sin ?\n\nwhere ? and ? refer to the roll (about the x -axis) and pitch (about the y-axis) angles,\nrespectively, using the aircraft axis convention (see Figure 3.A2 in the Appendix of\nChapter 3).\n\nThese torques contribute to the total disturbance torque in general, but an oscilla-\ntory \u2018libration\u2019 mode will occur if they govern the motion about the equilibrium state\n(see Section 3.5.1 of Chapter 3). For small oscillations of an axisymmetric spacecraft\n(Iyy = Ixx ), the motion is like a conical pendulum, whose frequency is\n\n?lib =\n?\n\n[(3?/r3)(1 ? Izz /Ixx )] rad/s (9.21)\n\nGravity-gradient torque provides a passive self-aligning torque that has been used (e.g.\nLDEF and Seasat), but the libration does need damping to be incorporated. The torque lev-\nels will be low unless a long thin configuration is used, or in the case of tethered satellites.\n\n9.4.4 Aerodynamic torques (external type)\n\nAerodynamic torques are dominated by the drag force, which is dependent on frontal area\nA. Their total moment about the centre-of-mass C may be assessed by considering the\nprojection in the direction of travel. If the spacecraft surface comprises a collection of\nsmall incremental areas dA, each with unit normal vectors n?, such that the position vector\nof the centre-of-area of each such small area with respect to C is r, then the aerodynamic\ntorque is given by\n\nTaero =\n?\n\nA\nr \u00d7 dFaero, dFaero = 1\n\n2\n?V 2a CD (n?.V?a)(?V?a)dA\n\n\n\n306 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nwhere ? is the atmospheric density, Va is the air-relative velocity of the vehicle (and\nV?a denotes its unit dimensionless vector), and CD is the drag coefficient (normally taken\nto be about 2.2). The area A over which the integral is performed is the spacecraft\nsurface for which n?.V?a ? 0\u2014in other words, the surfaces exposed to the incoming flow of\natmospheric particles. Usually this integral is not amenable to simple solution for a surface\nA associated with a complex spacecraft configuration. A commonly used alternative to\nassess the aero-torques is to represent the spacecraft as a collection of simple geometrical\nelements (e.g. flat plates over which the integral can be performed easily), and construct\na simple summation over all such surfaces exposed to the incoming particles. For a\nconfiguration model comprising n flat plates, each with unit normal n?i and area Ai , then\n\nTaero =\nn?\n\ni=1\nri \u00d7 Faero,i , Faero,i = 12?V\n\n2\na CD(n?i .V?a)Ai (?V?a) (9.22)\n\nfor values of i for which n?i .V?a ? 0. Here ri is the position vector of the centre-of-area\nof the i th plate with respect to C . This technique gives an adequate assessment of the\naero-torques, but does not take account of issues such as shadowing of one element by\nanother, or of multiple collisions of particles with the spacecraft.\n\nFor zero torque, spacecraft designers will aim to balance the terms in the summation\n(9.22), but engineering tolerances, shifts of the centre-of-mass and thermal distortion will\nusually give rise to a residual torque.\n\nThe torque is height-dependent, and is not an important effect above about 600 to\n700 km, depending upon the spacecraft configuration and the level of solar activity.\n\n9.4.5 Solar radiation pressure (external type)\n\nSolar radiation produces a force on a surface, which depends upon its distance from the\nSun; it is independent to first order of the height above the Earth. Large flat surfaces with\na significant moment arm about the centre-of-mass, such as solar arrays, may produce\na significant torque. Since light carries momentum, when it is reflected at a surface this\nrepresents an exchange of momentum with the surface, which gives rise to the SRP. This\nis not to be confused with the pressure exerted on the spacecraft by the solar wind (the\nstream of high-energy ionized particles emanating from the Sun), which at Earth orbit can\nbe orders of magnitude less than light pressure. The force exerted on the surface can be\ncalculated by a vector difference between the incoming and outgoing momentum fluxes.\nIf s? is the unit vector from the spacecraft to the Sun, and n? is the outward unit normal of\nan incremental area dA, then the force due to solar radiation is [1]\n\ndFSRP = ?P cos ?dA\n[\n(1 ? fs)s? + 2\n\n(\nfs cos ? + 13 fd\n\n)\nn?\n]\n\n, s?.n? ? 0\n\nwhere P is the mean momentum flux ?4.67 \u00d7 10?6 Nm?2 at the Earth, ? = cos?1(s?.n?)\nis the angle of incidence of the radiation and fs, fd are the coefficients of specular and\ndiffuse reflection, respectively.\n\nThe torque may be obtained by integrating the moment of the above force over the\nspacecraft\u2019s illuminated surface area. In practicality, this integration can be problematic,\nso a similar method to that described for aero-torques (Section 9.4.4) may be adopted.\n\n\n\nTORQUES AND TORQUERS 9.4 307\n\nFor example, if the configuration is approximated by a collection of i = 1 to n flat plates\nwith area Ai , normal n?i and incidence ?i , then the SRP torque can be expressed as\n\nTSRP =\nn?\n\ni=1\nri \u00d7 FSRP,i , FSRP,i = ai s? + bi n?i (9.23)\n\nwhere the summation is performed over the plates that are illuminated. Here ri is defined\nas in equation (9.22), and\n\nai = ?PAi cos ?i (1 ? fs,i ), bi = ?2PAi cos ?i (fs,i cos ?i + 13 fd,i )\n\nBoth aero and solar radiation pressure torques are in principle usable for counteract-\ning momentum build-up, and for trimming attitude (e.g. ASTRA 2B), but usually the\nspacecraft is designed such that the forces balance to give zero torque.\n\n9.4.6 Mass movement (internal type)\n\nThe movements of masses within a spacecraft may directly exert torques upon the main\nstructure. These are classified as internal torques and do not affect the total momentum.\nThe movements may also alter the location of the centre-of-mass within the spacecraft,\nand change the inertia matrix.\n\nThe centre-of-mass C has been identified as a key reference point for establishing the\ndynamic behaviour (Chapter 3). Moving the point affects the balance of the vehicle in\ndynamic ways. It also affects the torques due to forces on the vehicle, but not the couple\nof the magnetic torquer. In principle, the centre-of-mass location could be controlled in\norder to balance out the disturbance torques.\n\nA major source of mass movement is that of the fuel. The tanks are normally located\nin such a way that as their contents are used up the centre-of-mass does not shift.\nFuel movement within the tanks causes a different sort of problem in that it moves\nin a dynamic way in response to the motion of the spacecraft\u2014fuel slosh\u2014affecting its\nmodal characteristics.\n\nMass movements from one position to another, such as the erection of solar arrays and\nother appendages and movement of astronauts and so on, have an effect upon attitude,\nwhich is best assessed by using the fact that angular momentum is conserved.\n\n9.4.7 Momentum storage torquers (internal type)\n\nTorquers associated with momentum storage such as RWs and MWs are essentially inter-\nnal torquers, suitable for attitude control but not for controlling the total momentum.\n\nThese devices are purpose-built precision-engineered wheels that rotate about a fixed\naxis, with a built-in torque motor. Figure 9.9 shows a photograph of such a wheel with\nits protective cover removed. The basic design comprises a reliable bearing unit (with\na life expectancy of typically 15 years), a spoked flywheel mass and a DC motor in a\nvacuum-tight, evacuated housing. The stator is controlled by the drive electronics, which\nmay be seen under the wheel. The mechanism aspects of RWs and MWs are discussed\nin Chapter 15.\n\n\n\n308 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nFigure 9.9 TELDIX Space Wheel RSI 68. (Reproduced by permission of Rockwell\nCollins Deutschland GmbH)\n\nIt is difficult to generalize about the range of wheel characteristics available for use\nin \u2018large\u2019 spacecraft (mass of the order of a tonne or more), but we may attempt to\nsummarize it as\u2014wheel diameter ?20 to 40 cm; wheel mass (including torque motor)\n?3 to 10 kg; momentum storage capacity ?5 to 70 kg m2/s. With the relatively recent\ntrend to use wheels (see Chapter 18) to control \u2018small\u2019 satellites (mass of the order of\n50 kg), much smaller wheels are required, and these are often designed and manufactured\nas part of the smallsat programme.\n\nReaction wheels have a nominally zero speed, and may be rotated in either direction\nin response to the control torques called for by the spacecraft\u2019s ACS. However, it should\nbe noted that at low or zero angular rate, the wheel displays a non-linear response due to\n\u2018sticking friction\u2019, which can impose an irregular motion on the spacecraft in this region.\nThis problem is often circumvented by setting the nominal operating speed of the wheels\nabove zero rate, at a few rpm.\n\nMomentum wheels on the other hand have a high mean speed (in the range typically\n5000 to 10 000 r.p.m.) in order to provide momentum bias. The control torques will then\nslow down or increase the wheel speed, the permissible amount being about 10% of the\nmean value.\n\nBoth types of wheel provide momentum storage, and need to be used in conjunction\nwith external torquers, as described in Section 9.2.2. (See also Chapter 15.)\n\nFor three-axis control, three orthogonal reaction wheels will be the minimum require-\nment. A redundant fourth is normally added at an equal angle to the other three, in order\nto avoid a single-point failure. When more than one MW is used, the total bias is the\nvector sum of contributions from the separate wheels.\n\nThe principle of MWs has been extended by the development of more advanced forms,\nsuch as control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). By mounting the wheel in gimbals fitted\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MEASUREMENT 9.5 309\n\nwith torque motors, all three components of torque may be developed from a single\nwheel. This can be done to a limited extent with sophisticated wheels mounted on five-\ndegree-of-freedom magnetic bearings (see Chapter 15). There is potential for incorporating\nattitude sensing with momentum storage and momentum bias in sophisticated devices of\nthis type.\n\n9.5 ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT\n\n9.5.1 Attitude: its meaning and measurement\n\nThe meaning of \u2018attitude\u2019 or \u2018orientation\u2019 usually presents no conceptual difficulties. There\nmust be some datum frame of reference, and once this has been chosen then the attitude\nof a spacecraft refers to its angular departure from this datum. A right-handed set of axes\nis normally used in order to define a frame of reference, and if both a datum set and a\nset of spacecraft axes are chosen, then the attitude may be defined in a way that may\nbe quantified.\n\nSpecifying attitude may be done in a number of ways such as Euler angles, direction\ncosines, quaternions and so on [3]. Three pieces of information are needed. A common\nway is to use the three Euler angles that are defined in the same way as is standard\npractice for aircraft. These are the angles of yaw ? , pitch ? and roll ?, as measures of\nthe rotations about the z -, y- and x -axes, respectively, in that sequence, which are needed\nto bring the datum axes into alignment with those of the spacecraft. Figure 3.A2 in the\nAppendix of Chapter 3 illustrates these rotations.\n\nFor a spacecraft in circular orbit, whose z -axis is nominally down the local vertical and\nwhose x -axis is nominally in the direction of travel, the aircraft\u2019s standard is frequently\nused. For other applications, a star-fixed (inertial) set would be better. There is, however,\nno universally accepted standard for specifying a spacecraft\u2019s attitude.\n\nA potential problem when using Euler angles as defined above is that there is a\nsingularity when the pitch angle ? is 90?. Whilst a set of angles (? , 90?, ?) may be\nchosen to specify any such attitude, it is not a unique set. For example, if the aircraft\u2019s\nset is used for Shuttle, namely, x is horizontal, z is vertically down and y completes\nthe right-handed set, then when it is on the launch-pad its pitch attitude is 90? and its\nyaw and roll angles cannot be uniquely specified. Such a problem may be overcome by\nchoosing a more suitable datum set.\n\nIt is worth noting that angles, and consequently attitude, are not vector quantities. The\ncombination (? , ? , ?) should not be thought of as three components of a vector. On the\nother hand, the rates of change of ?? , ?? , ?? can be interpreted as vector quantities whose\ndirections are along the (non-orthogonal) axes about which the rotations take place (see\nFigure 3.A2 in the Appendix of Chapter 3). Resolving ?? , ?? , ?? along spacecraft axes\nenables the components of the spacecraft\u2019s angular velocity ? relative to the datum axes\nto be expressed as\n\n?x = ?? ? ?? sin ?\n?y = ?? cos ? + ?? cos ? sin ? (9.24)\n?z = ?? cos ? cos ? ? ?? sin ?\n\n\n\n310 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nThe inverse relationship is\n\n?? = (?y sin ? + ?z cos ?)/ cos ?\n?? = ?y cos ? ? ?z sin ? (9.25)\n?? = ?x + (?y sin ? + ?z cos ?) tan ?\n\nWhen the angles are small, then ?? ? ?z , ?? ? ?y and ?? ? ?x .\nEquations (9.25) indicate how, by integration, the attitude in the form of the Euler\n\nangles (? , ? , ?) may be obtained from measured components of angular velocity. The\nsingularity at ? = 90? shows up in the form of tan ? and will lead to problems with the\nintegration as ? approaches this value.\n\n9.5.2 Measurement system fundamentals\n\nFundamentally, the measurement of attitude requires the determination of three pieces of\ninformation that relate the spacecraft axes to some datum set, whether they are in the form\nof Euler angles or in other forms. The measurement subsystem must include sufficient\nsensors to enable the information to be extracted with the necessary accuracy and with\nreasonable simplicity. This must be done in all phases of the mission.\n\nThere are two categories of sensor , and they are commonly used to complement each\nother in a measurement system:\n\n\u2022 The reference sensor gives a definite \u2018fix\u2019 by measuring the direction of an object\nsuch as the Sun or a star, but there are normally periods of eclipse during which its\ninformation is not available.\n\n\u2022 Inertial sensors measure continuously, but they measure only changes in attitude,\neffectively relative to a gyroscope. They therefore need a fix\u2014a calibration from\nreference sensors. In between fixes, their errors progressively increase because of\nrandom drifts.\n\nA measurement system may be formed by using reference and inertial sensors to com-\nplement each other. In a simple combination, the reference sensors will calibrate the\ninertial sensor at discrete times and the latter will then effectively \u2018remember\u2019 the ref-\nerence object\u2019s direction until the next calibration. This allows a period in eclipse to\nbe covered. The accuracy of the system will fluctuate, being that of the reference sen-\nsor at the calibration instant, and steadily degrading until the next calibration, as shown\nin Figure 9.10.\n\nIt is clear that the achievement of good system accuracy calls for good accuracy from\nthe reference sensors, and a low degradation (drift) rate from the inertial sensors. In\npractice, it is likely that the mixing will take place in a computational Kalman filter to\nminimize errors, the design of which is a specialist topic.\n\nComplete attitude information requires three pieces of information as explained above.\nReference sensors that are based upon detecting the direction of a single vector are inca-\npable of providing all three pieces. A sun sensor cannot detect any rotation of spacecraft\nabout the Sun vector, for example. Two vector directions, ideally orthogonal, are needed\nfor complete attitude information to be obtained from simultaneous measurements.\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MEASUREMENT 9.5 311\n\n1\n\nProbable error\n\nReference\nsensor\nerror\n\n2 3\n\nReference sensor sample numbers\n\n4 5 Time\n\nFigure 9.10 Error history for a mixed reference/inertial sensor system\n\nA star sensor may have the ability to track more than one star within its field of view\n(FOV), thereby monitoring the two or more vector directions that are needed for full\nattitude information. The angle between these directions will be far from the ideal of\n90?, however.\n\nIn some cases, the two different vector directions can be monitored by just one sensor,\nbut with the measurements separated by a time interval. Then the change in attitude during\nthe interval must also be measured, by using inertial sensors, and the time interval must\nbe short enough for the build-up of errors from these sensors to be acceptable.\n\nA star scanner is one example. It scans the heavens and so one sensor uses different\nstar directions for complete attitude determination. The time lapse between viewing two\nstars in orthogonal directions will be short enough to avoid significant build-up of errors.\n\nAn Earth sensor (detecting the local vertical) can be used in a similar fashion. The\nlocal vertical rotates in space through 90? in a quarter of a circular orbit, a lapse of about\n23 minutes in LEO and 6 hours in geostationary orbit. The Sun vector\u2019s \u201890? time\u2019 is\nthree months\u2014too long for use in this way! In practice, the Earth vector direction will\nbe monitored continuously; the \u201890? time\u2019 merely gives an indication of the degradation\nin accuracy due to the sensor system\u2019s reliance upon inertial sensors.\n\nThe accuracy required will normally be set by the payload, its pointing direction and the\nrequired measurement accuracy. There will be an ultimate accuracy of measurement that\nis determined by the object used by the sensor; stars provide the most accurate sources,\nwith the Sun and Earth being progressively less accurate by virtue of the angle that they\nsubtend at the sensor and the fuzziness of the Earth horizon. A rough guide to accuracies\nis shown in Table 9.3.\n\nTable 9.3 Potential accuracies of reference sensors\n\nReference object Potential accuracy\n\nStars 1 arc second\nSun 1 arc minute\nEarth (horizon) 6 arc minutes\nRF beacon 1 arc minute\nMagnetometer 30 arc minutes\nNavstar Global Positioning System (GPS) 6 arc minutes\n\nNote: This table gives only a guideline. The GPS estimate depends upon the\n\u2018baseline\u2019 used (see text).\n\n\n\n312 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nThe extent to which the ultimate accuracy is realized in a given instrument depends\nupon its design, and this will be related to its intended use. Each sensor will have a limited\nFOV, beyond which it gives no information. In getting a spacecraft to its intended attitude\nit will normally be necessary to include very wide-angle low-accuracy sensors for use\nwhen steering the craft towards the state in which the accurate sensor has its objective in\nits field of view.\n\nEach phase of the mission must be addressed when the list of sensors is being compiled.\nIn the early stages, the visibility conditions will be quite different from those when it is\non station, partly because the orbit is different, but also because of stowed arrays and so\non. The sensor list must also cover the possibility that the spacecraft attitude may need\nto be recaptured following a failure of some sort.\n\nThe datum axes that are used when defining the attitude of the spacecraft are normally\nrelated to its payload. A telescope is likely to need star-based datum axes for specifying\nits attitude, for example. For the control system, it is the error measured from the\nintended attitude that is important and in many systems, sensors will be chosen to\nmeasure this directly. For example, the pointing of the solar arrays towards the Sun will\nuse a Sun sensor. Earth-facing hardware will possibly use the local vertical as a datum,\nor maybe RF beacons on the ground that have been set up for the purpose. The error\nin measuring the pointing direction of the payload will be reduced if the sensor uses a\nrelated reference object.\n\nErrors in measuring the payload\u2019s pointing direction will also depend upon the physical\nseparation between it and the sensor. If each is mounted on the same base, then the\nmounting tolerances of both instruments will be sources of error, and so will distortions\nof the base due to thermal or other effects. Error paths of this type should be kept to a\nminimum and must be carefully assessed when the location of sensors measuring payload-\npointing directions is being considered. For extreme accuracy, the payload pointing will\nbe calibrated in space.\n\n9.5.3 Types of reference sensor\n\nThere are numerous different engineered forms of sensor. Only a brief review of the\nselection on offer is given here.\n\nSun sensors\n\nThe Sun subtends an angle of about 30 arc minutes at Earth, and provides a well-defined\nvector, which is unambiguous because of the intensity of the radiation. Sensors range\nfrom mere presence detectors that determine whether the Sun is in a specified FOV, to\ninstruments that measure its direction to an accuracy of better than one arc minute. An\nexample of the latter is the reticle slits mask detector , shown schematically in Figure 9.11.\nThe sensor comprises a transparent block of known refractive index, coated in a thin\nopaque film. An entry slit is etched into the upper surface, and reticle slits in the base,\nand the block mounted on a sequence of photo-cell detectors. When exposed to the Sun,\na plane of sunlight intersects the base so that some of the photo-cells receive photons\ngiving a \u20181\u2019 output, whereas others do not and so are assigned a \u20180\u2019. The digital output can\nbe mapped onto a unique entry angle, using the Gray code, allowing the plane in which\nthe Sun lies to be determined. Two such detectors, mounted on a three-axis stabilized\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MEASUREMENT 9.5 313\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0 0\n\n0\n\nDigital output\n\nGray code\nbits\n\nSun\nimage\n\nReticle slits\n\nEntrance slit\n\n?\n\nPhotocells\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\nSign\nbit\n\nFigure 9.11 Sun sensor with digital output\n\nspacecraft with their entry slits orthogonal to each other, give sufficient information to\ndetermine the spacecraft-Sun vector in the body axes. One detector mounted on a spinning\nspacecraft is sufficient to determine the solar aspect angle\u2014between the Sun vector and\nthe spin axis.\n\nAnother type of digital sun sensor again has orthogonal entry slits, which permits pho-\ntons to be incident upon two orthogonally-mounted linear charge coupled device (CCD)\narrays\u2014again allowing the spacecraft-Sun vector to be determined.\n\nAn alternative method to determine the Sun vector on a spinning vehicle is to use a \u2018V\nslit\u2019 sensor , an example of which is illustrated in Figure 9.12. This shows the sensor array\non the STRV -1 (Space Technology Research Vehicle), which is a spinning microsatellite\n(?50 kg mass) built by QinetiQ at Farnborough, UK. The V slit Sun sensor is indicated\nby the arrow. The Sun is viewed through the two slits, set at an angle as illustrated.\nDetection of the Sun through the first, \u2018vertical\u2019 slit gives a measure of the rotational\n\u2018azimuth\u2019 of the spacecraft relative to the Sun. With knowledge of the spin rate of the\nvehicle, the time taken for the Sun to appear in the second slit, gives a measure of the\n\u2018elevation\u2019 of the Sun above or below the plane in which the instrument rotates. Other\ntypes of optical/detector combinations are available.\n\nEarth sensors\n\nThe Earth, radius Re, subtends an angle 2 sin?1[Re/(Re + h)] at a spacecraft at height\nh . At 500 km altitude this is about 135? (so that an Earth-presence detector is not very\nuseful!), and this falls to about 17.5? at geostationary height. The determination of the\nnadir vector (the spacecraft-to-geocentre direction) can be achieved, however, by sensing\nthe position of the Earth\u2019s horizon, and Earth-horizon sensors provide the means of doing\nthis. For example, the nadir vector can be determined by bisecting the directions to the\nhorizon at the ends of a diameter of the Earth\u2019s disc.\n\n\n\n314 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nFigure 9.12 The V slit Sun sensor on the STRV-1 microsatellite. (Reproduced by\npermission of QinetiQ Ltd)\n\nEarth sensors are usually designed to operate in the infra-red, often in the ?15 ?m CO2\nabsorption band due to the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 There is less variation between maximum and minimum radiance compared to the\nvisible band.\n\n\u2022 The terminator (the dividing line between night and day on the Earth\u2019s disc) dis-\nappears in the infra-red. Although the night-time is generally cooler than the day,\nthe variation is small compared to absolute zero. The modelling of the complex and\nvariable geometry of the visible terminator is also avoided.\n\n\u2022 The \u2018infra-red Earth\u2019 is always present as a reference object, even when the spacecraft\nis in eclipse.\n\n\u2022 However, bolometers (heat detectors) are required, which generally have a slow\nresponse.\n\nThe static Earth-horizon sensor , which is illustrated schematically in Figure 9.13, is a\nconceptually simple device used on three-axis stabilized spacecraft in high circular orbits,\nin particular, GEO. The infra-red image of the Earth is focused on the focal plane of the\ninstrument. With nominal attitude, the image falls equally upon heat-detecting arrays, as\nshown. However, if the spacecraft attitude has errors in pitch or roll, the \u2018signal\u2019 will\ndecrease in some arrays and increase in others. The instrument cannot detect errors in\nyaw (rotations about the local vertical).\n\nA scanning Earth-horizon sensor is generally used in LEO to determine the nadir\nvector. Typically, a narrow FOV (\u2018pencil beam\u2019) is swept across the Earth horizon to\ndetect the abrupt change in infra-red signal between viewing \u2018deep space\u2019 and Earth.

Figure 9.14 shows schematically a typical scan geometry. The pencil\nbeam traces out a cone, of known semi-angle ? , that intersects the Earth horizon at two\nlocations, one corresponding to acquisition of the infra-red signal and the other to the loss\nof signal. With knowledge of the scan rate, the measurement made is an estimate of the\nfraction of the scan period between acquisition and loss of signal. This, combined with\n\nEarth\n\nScan path\n\nPencil beam\n\nSpacecraft\n\nFigure 9.14 Scanning technique for an Earth horizon sensor\n\n\n\n316 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nFigure 9.15 A scanning infra-red Earth-horizon sensor for LEO. The unit illustrated is\nthe STD16 sensor. (Reproduced by permission of EADS SODERN)\n\nknowledge of ? and the Earth\u2019s angular size, can be used to estimate the angle between\nthe spin axis of the scan mechanism and the nadir vector. Figure 9.15 shows a scanning\ninfra-red Earth-horizon sensor, which has two such scan cones on opposite sides of the\nspacecraft. If their pulses are of equal duration, then the local vertical lies in the plane\nbisecting the cone angles, and this can form the basis of a nulling control system for roll\nmotion. Pitch sensing uses the fact that the local vertical lies in the plane defined by the\nbisector of the pulse from each conical scan.\n\nFor this system, one cone angle will be suitable for only a limited range of altitudes.\nIn some sensors, the angle may be adjusted to accommodate the changes in altitude as\nthe spacecraft moves from LEO to geostationary height.\n\nStar sensors\n\nStar sensors are the most accurate reference sensors in common use for measuring attitude.\nAccuracies of 1 arc second or better may be obtained. But the large number of stars means\nthat sophisticated techniques are needed in the instrument and its associated computer\nin order to identify any particular star in its FOV. This problem is usually overcome by\nrelying on a degree of a priori knowledge of the attitude of the spacecraft, or by adjusting\nthe detection threshold of the sensor to reduce the number of \u2018targets\u2019. Star sensors once\nhad the reputation of being massive, power-hungry and expensive, but the advent of CCD\ntechnology has led to considerable improvements in their system characteristics.\n\nStar sensors may be classified as\n\n\u2022 Star scanners for mounting on a spinning spacecraft. The spin provides a means for\nthe instrument to scan the sky. The characteristics of stars passing through the FOV\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MEASUREMENT 9.5 317\n\ncan be compared with a star directory in order to determine attitude. A \u2018V slit screen\u2019\ncan be used (see section on Sun sensors) to determine the spacecraft-star vector.\n\n\u2022 Star trackers for mounting on a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. Their detectors/\ncontrollers enable them to select, locate and track one stellar image with precision.\nClearly one such fix is insufficient to determine the spacecraft attitude uniquely. Two\nsuch trackers \u2018staring\u2019 in orthogonal directions, as used on the US Space Shuttle,\nwill provide an optimal, unique attitude estimate.\n\n\u2022 Star mappers for mounting on a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. Their FOV is suffi-\ncient to include several stars. They locate and record the position of each, so allowing\nthe spacecraft\u2019s orientation about the sensor\u2019s axis to be determined.\n\nConsiderable improvements in star sensors, referred to above, have been achieved with\nthe use of solid-state detectors. CCD and APS (active pixel sensor) detectors have led\nto lower mass, volume and power characteristics for the same performance in terms of\naccuracy. Figure 9.16 shows the Hydra star-sensing system, with three optical heads,\ndeveloped by EADS SODERN. Each head operates using a 1024 \u00d7 1024 APS array,\nand can track 15 stars simultaneously at 10 Hz. Generally, star trackers/mappers provide\ninformation to refine knowledge of spacecraft attitude to high accuracy. This unit can\nalso determine angular velocity, up to 10?/second, paving the way to gyro-less spacecraft\noperation. Its mass is 1.35 kg per optical head, plus 1.75 kg for the electronics unit, and\na typical power consumption with three heads is 11 W at 20?C.\n\nFigure 9.16 The Hydra APS star sensor, which integrates three optical heads into one\nsystem. (Reproduced by permission of EADS SODERN)\n\n\n\n318 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nRadio frequency beacons\n\nDirection-finding techniques may be used to detect the direction of an RF source, with an\naccuracy of order 1 arc minute. There are several techniques by which this can be done.\n\nFor example, Ulysses, rotating at a nominal 5 rpm, carried an antenna whose axis is\noffset from the spin axis. The intensity of the signal that it received from a ground station\nwas thereby modulated at the spin frequency. The actual spin rate and its phase, and the\nangle between the spin axis and the ground station direction, was then derived respectively\nfrom the frequency, the phase and the depth of modulation.\n\nMagnetometers\n\nThe magnetometer is a robust instrument but with an accuracy that is limited to about\n0.5?. It measures the direction and possibly the strength of the local magnetic field. But\nthe field is not well mapped and has abnormalities that make the sensor of limited use\nfor attitude sensing. To gain attitude information, the measured field is compared to a\nmagnetic field model held in the on-board processor. The magnetometer is also used in\nconjunction with magnetic torquers as described in Section 9.4.2.\n\nAttitude determination using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)\n\nGNSS, such as the Navstar GPS system, is commonly used for the determination of orbital\nposition, but it can also be used to determine spacecraft attitude. Figure 9.17 illustrates\nthe principle. A set of GPS patch antennae (at least three), slaved to a GPS receiver, are\nlocated on an \u2018upward looking\u2019 face of the spacecraft. If L is the baseline vector between\ntwo such antennae, and e is the unit vector along the line of sight to a GPS satellite P,\nthen the range from P to each of the antennae differs by an amount\n\n?? = L.e = L cos ?\n\nThe measurement made is the phase difference between the two antennae, which allows\n?? and therefore ? to be estimated. A similar procedure using each antenna baseline and\n\nL\n\ne\n\nspacecraft\n\nGPS patch antennae\n\nP\n\ndr\n\nq\n\nFigure 9.17 The principle of attitude determination using GNSS\n\n\n\nATTITUDE MEASUREMENT 9.5 319\n\nmultiple GPS satellites, allows the attitude of the spacecraft to be constructed. Accura-\ncies of the order of ?0.1? are possible, although this will depend on the length of the\nbaseline. Increasing this is not without its problems, however, as there is more flexure in\nlong baselines that will compromise the accuracy. The phase difference measurement\nis also inherently ambiguous because of the unknown number of GPS signal wave-\nlengths received between antennae. Finally multi-path \u2014unwanted local reflections of the\nsignal\u2014can also pose problems. Despite these difficulties, however, attitude determination\nusing GNSS is an established technique, which has been demonstrated in orbit [5].\n\n9.5.4 Inertial sensors\n\nGyroscopes form the basis of the inertial sensing system for attitude. The conventional,\nmechanical gyro has a rotor mounted in a single gimbal in an environment that is very\ncarefully controlled. In the rate- and rate-integrating types, the gimbal is torqued so that\nit follows the motion of the spacecraft. The torque is then a measure of the angular rate\nabout the instrument\u2019s sensitive axis (see equation 3.29).\n\nA set of three orthogonal rate-gyros will measure the components (?x , ?y , ?z ) of the\nspacecraft\u2019s inertial angular velocity; a fourth at a skew angle is normally carried to avoid\na single-point failure. The output of a rate-integrating gyro (RIG) is the integral of the\nangular velocity component, such as\n\n?\n?x dt and so on. Only when the direction of a RIG\n\naxis remains fixed in space does its output represent the angular displacement about the\naxis. In more general motion equations (9.25) apply.\n\nIn high-quality sensors, drift rates of less than 0.001 degree/h are obtainable. Recent\nyears have seen the development and introduction of gyroscopic sensors without moving\nmechanisms. The best known of these is perhaps the Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG). This\ncomprises a small triangular prism of ceramic glass, the vertices of which are truncated to\nform optically flat surfaces. Laser light is then introduced and split at one vertex, so that\ntwo beams are internally reflected around the prism in opposing directions. If the prism is\nrotated around the axis normal to the triangle, then the path length of light traversing the\nprism in the same sense as the rotation is longer than that for the beam in the opposite\ndirection. This difference, detected by examining the interference between the two beams,\ngives a measure of the inertial angular rate about the sensitive axis. Figure 9.18 shows a\nRLG test rig, in which the housing of the gyro pack has been cut away to reveal the trian-\ngular prisms within. Such a RLG pack usually comprises three such prisms, with mutually\nperpendicular sensitive axes, to give angular rates about each of the three spacecraft axes.\nThe drift rate for such a device is typically of the order of 10?3 degrees per hour.\n\nA device that uses a similar principle is the Fibre Optic Gyroscope (FOG), which\nis generally less massive than the RLG, the need for the prismatic block having been\neliminated. In this instrument, laser light is fed simultaneously into both ends of a long\n(? km) fibre optic coil. When the coil rotates about its axis, the counter-rotating beams\nagain travel different distances before they reach the detector, and the phase difference\ngives a measure of the rotation rate.\n\nAnother class of gyroscopic device is based upon the response of a mechanical res-\nonator to the Coriolis force generated by rotation, first analysed by Bryan in 1890 [6].\nThe principle of operation of one such device, the Hemispherical Resonator Gyroscope\n(HRG), can be thought of in terms of a resonating wine glass. When the glass is made to\n\u2018sing\u2019 (resonate), a standing wave is produced on its surface. When the glass is rotated\n\n\n\n320 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nFigure 9.18 A ring laser gyro pack, showing two orthogonal triangular prisms.\n(Reproduced by permission of SELEX Galileo, UK)\n\nabout the stem (the sensitive gyro axis), the nodes and anti-nodes of this wave precess\nat a rate dependent upon the inertial angular velocity. The HRG therefore comprises a\nhemispherical fused silica or quartz shell, which is electrostatically actuated and sensed to\ndetermine the shell\u2019s response and measure the wave\u2019s precession. Such devices have been\nused in flight (e.g. the Cassini mission to Saturn), and have a performance that matches\nadvanced RLGs. The principle of the HRG has been extended to other resonator geome-\ntries, to simplify manufacture. Gyroscopic devices, sometimes referred to as Piezoelectric\nVibratory Gyroscopes (PVGs), are available. These units are relatively inexpensive, with\nan overall size similar to, or smaller than a matchbox. This type of device makes use\nof vibrational modes of a piezoelectric body, which can have a variety of shapes such\nas a beam, a tuning fork or a circular ring. Generally two modes of vibration are used\nwhich have material particles moving in perpendicular directions. One of the two modes is\nexcited by applying an alternating electric voltage. If the device is then rotated in inertial\nspace, the Coriolis effects will excite the second mode, through which the angular rate\ncan be estimated from the electrical signals resulting from the second mode. A review\nof this type of device is given by Yang [7], to which the reader is referred for more\ndetail. Furthermore, very small devices based upon this principle can be produced using\n\n\n\nACS COMPUTATION 9.6 321\n\nadvanced microfabrication techniques. At the time of writing, however, the performance\nof these microgyros is insufficient for many space applications.\n\n9.6 ACS COMPUTATION\n\n9.6.1 The computer\n\nThe development of digital computers for use in spacecraft has proceeded rapidly. They\nmust perform reliably in the radiation environment of space, and many space-qualified\nprocessors exist. Further development is providing more power and speed, and the capa-\nbility of being programmed in higher-level languages. These on-board computers (OBCs)\nlink with ground control computers, which will normally host their software development\ntools. The availability of powerful computers means that spacecraft are given greater\nautonomy, and many of the sophisticated control techniques that find applications in\nground-based systems may be used on spacecraft.\n\nRobustness is a requirement for ACS and other on-board systems. For example, the ACS\nmust potentially operate with large flexible structures such as solar arrays, whose natural\nfrequencies cannot be established accurately before launch. Fixed algorithms will tolerate\nonly limited variation from their expected value. The ability to reprogram the OBC from\nGround Control permits any necessary adjustment of the control algorithms to be made\nfollowing calibration of the spacecraft\u2019s parameters after launch. For full autonomy or\nimmediate response to any changes that occur such as hardware failures, adaptive control\ntechniques may be used. Indeed, the uploading of mission or control software is routinely\nperformed to adapt to changing requirements or to enhance performance.\n\nComputer power will also benefit the attitude measurement subsystem. The fusion of\nsensor data to achieve maximum accuracy via the Kalman type of filter requires computer\nmodelling. In addition, they can provide the substantial data backup, which is needed when\nstar mappers and scanners are used.\n\n9.6.2 Active attitude control using a PID algorithm\n\nThe sophisticated techniques mentioned above are beyond the scope of this text, and for\nthese the reader is referred to more specialized texts [3, 8]. However, there are many\ncontrol situations that are satisfactorily achieved by using a simple Proportional, integral\nand differential (PID) algorithm, and the following discussion addresses the question of\ncontrolling a spacecraft\u2019s attitude using this.\n\nThe principle of active control involves the measurement of the spacecraft\u2019s attitude\nusing installed sensors, and comparing this with the desired attitude as explained in\nSection 9.2.4. The error signals \u2014the difference between the measured and the desired\nattitude\u2014are then used in appropriate algorithms within the OBC to determine corrective\ntorques (see Figure 9.2). Euler angles ?, ? , ? are commonly used as measures of the\nerrors when they are small and may also be used when only one of them is large, but\nalternative measures are direction cosines or quaternions.\n\nA torque acting upon a spacecraft may cause an angular acceleration or, when momen-\ntum bias is used, an angular velocity. A PID algorithm can be used in both cases, but\nit is discussed here in the context of zero-momentum-bias when the torque causes an\n\n\n\n322 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\n?1\n?0.8\n?0.6\n?0.4\n?0.2\n0.0\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\nDisturbance torqueTxd\n\nTime (arbitrary units)\n\nRoll error f\n\nControl torque Txc\n\nFigure 9.19 The response of the roll error ? and the control torque Txc due to a PD\nalgorithm (no integral term) in the presence of a disturbance torque Txd\n\nacceleration of the existing error towards zero\u2014its desired value.

For example, the overshoot in the response is\nabout 16% when ? = 0.5 (see Figure 9.19).\n\nThe implementation of a PID control algorithm for the roll error ?\n\nAlthough we treat the roll angle ? in the remainder of this section, the equations for the\npitch ? and yaw ? take the same form.\n\nThe total roll torque Tx will in general include a disturbance torque Txd as well as the\ncontrol torque Txc from the actuator, leading to\n\nIxx ?? = Tx = Txd + Txc (9.27)\n\nUsing a control torque Txc that involves only the proportional and differential parts of the\nPID algorithm, namely,\n\nTxc = ?Kxp? ? Kxd ?? (9.28)\n\nand inserting this into equation (9.27) leads to\n\n?? + (Kxd/Ixx )?? + (Kxp/Ixx )? = Txd/Ixx (9.29)\n\nThis has the same form as equation (9.26) except that its right-hand side is not zero.\n\n\n\nACS COMPUTATION 9.6 323\n\nThe response of equation (9.29) to an initial error, caused by a command for a new\norientation say, is shown in Figure 9.19. When the transient has died away, then the roll\nattitude will have an error ? = Txd/Kxp . This will reduce to zero when the integral term\nin the PID controller is included. The full algorithm, in general form, is\n\nTxc = ?Kxp? ? Kxd ?? ? Kxi\n?\n\n?dt (9.30)\n\nSome practical issues are involved:\n\n\u2022 The torquers above were assumed to be ones whose torque magnitude is controllable.\nRWs answer this description (Table 9.2). There will, however, be a limit to the amount\nof torque that these devices can provide. Therefore, high values of the PID constants\nwill lead to a call for large torques to achieve a rapid response.\n\n\u2022 The spacecraft will not be entirely rigid as was assumed in the theory above. Its\nstructure will have oscillatory flexure modes, the natural frequencies of which will\nbe very low if there are large flexible appendages such as solar arrays. Their damping\nratios may be only of order 0.015\u2014definitely stable, but only just. The output of all\nattitude sensors will include a measure of modal excitation, the amount depending\nupon their location within the modal shapes. It is important that the control algorithm\ndoes not lead to a destabilizing feedback to these modes. In large spacecraft, it will\nbe necessary to include many modes in the mathematical model when designing the\nfinal form of the algorithms, but the modal data in this model is likely to be imperfect\nprior to launch. Some calibration and adjustment of the controller parameters may\nbe necessary in orbit.\n\n\u2022 The angular rate term ?? may be provided by a rate gyroscope. It may alterna-\ntively be calculated by differentiating the signal from a roll angle sensor. Any\nsudden repointing demand, however, will create an immediate change in the roll\nerror , and differentiating this step function should be avoided if possible. In gen-\neral, differentiation will amplify any high-frequency \u2018noise\u2019 and also the content of\nany high-frequency flexure modes in the signal. Some attenuation of this must be\nincluded in the differentiation process.\n\n\u2022 When large repointing manoeuvres are required, cross-coupling between the roll,\npitch and yaw motions may become detrimental. Lower values of the PID constants\nwill alleviate this, but an alternative is to carry out these large manoeuvres as a\nsequence of roll followed by pitch and then yaw, say, so that only one of these\nangles is large at any one time.\n\nIn summary, although the preceding theory indicated no limit to the magnitude of\nthe PID parameters Kxp , Kxi , Kxd , they will nevertheless be limited by the practical\nconsiderations, and possibly severely so.\n\nOn/Off control\n\nThrusters used for applying a torque for attitude control can only be used in an on/off\nmanner, with different jets being used for positive and negative torques about each axis.\n\n\n\n324 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nThe pulses required for repointing a momentum bias direction as opposed to a zero-\nmomentum bias axis are very different, as illustrated in Figure 9.7. The zero-momentum\nbias case used above will also be discussed here.\n\nA PID algorithm controlling the level of torque is theoretically capable of producing\nzero attitude error, even when there is a constant disturbance torque, as has been shown\nabove. With on/off control the limitation of having only three torque levels\u2014clockwise,\nzero or anticlockwise\u2014means that the control objective becomes \u2018the maintenance of an\nattitude error within acceptable bounds\u2019. Furthermore, this must be done with a minimum\nof fuel usage.\n\nWith on/off control the error ? is expected to settle into a limit cycle under steady\nconditions as shown in Figure 9.20. A simple \u2018P\u2019 control law has been used, the appro-\npriate torquer being switched on when the roll error exceeds a specified threshold value,\n|?| ? ?0. With no momentum bias there is an angular acceleration while |?| ? ?0, and\nconstant angular rate otherwise. Under these conditions, the speed at which the error\ncrosses between the boundaries where ? = \u00b1?0 is the same in each direction, and so the\nperiod and hence the fuel consumption will depend on its speed when the thrusters are\nfirst switched off. Figure 9.20 illustrates this. The control strategy shown in Figure 9.20(a)\nhas twice the initial roll-rate as that of Figure 9.20(b), and consequently twice the fuel\nconsumption per cycle, and a shorter period.\n\nThis shows that a switching signal that is proportional to the error alone is not satis-\nfactory. However, it will be used to demonstrate some other aspects of on/off control.\n\nThe effect of a disturbance torque can be beneficial, as shown in Figure 9.21. Its\noptimum value is that which returns the error to the same switching level, ? = +?0 in\n\nRoll error  f \n\nTorque pulses\n\nTime t\n\nTorque pulses\n\nRoll error f\n\n0\n\nf0\n\n?f0\n\n(a)   Initial roll-rate f = ?f0\n? ?

Greater disturbance torques\nwill increase fuel expenditure.\n\nThe PID controller for an On/Off system\n\nFigures 9.20 and 9.21 involve the torquer switching ON when |?| ? ?0. Implementing\nthis will be achieved by a computer-generated signal ? that switches on the appropriate\ntorquer when |?| ? ?0. The equation for the switching signal above was ? = ?, a PID\ncontrol signal with the proportional \u2018P\u2019 term only.\n\nThe inclusion of a differential term to form a \u2018PD\u2019 controller means that as ? approaches\nthe switching level ? = ?0 say, the torquer will switch ON before reaching it, and as\nit returns it will again switch OFF early since the sign of ?? will have changed. This\nprogressively reduces the speed of entry into the zero torque \u2018corridor\u2019 as shown in\nFigure 9.22. In theory, this could result in an indefinite zero angular rate within the\ndesired corridor, but a disturbance torque will not allow this to happen.\n\nThe inclusion of an integral term, to create a full PID controller, can cause a response\nsuch as is shown in Figure 9.23 under a constant disturbance. It has the effect of lowering\nthe switching boundary progressively under steady disturbance torque conditions, until\nthe average error over a limit cycle is zero.\n\n0\n\nf0\n\n?f0\n\nRoll error f\n\nTorque pulses\n\nTime t\n\nFigure 9.22 Roll error response with a PD controller, in the presence of a disturbance\ntorque\n\n0\n\nf0\n\n?f0\n\nRoll error f\n\nTorque pulses\n\nTime t\n\nFigure 9.23 Roll error with full PID control, with a disturbance torque\n\n\n\n326 ATTITUDE CONTROL\n\nSome practical considerations\n\n\u2022 Torquer pulses will not be the instantaneous sharp-edged ones that have been assumed\nabove.

Furthermore, the parameters of the PID controller can be\nmodified if a change of mission emphasis occurs, say from \u2018high pointing accuracy\u2019\nto \u2018fuel conservation\u2019.\n\nAs we have indicated, there are a number of limitations to the brief treatment presented\nhere. For a text in which these are addressed in the context of spacecraft control, the reader\nis referred to Reference [3]. More generally, the topic of automatic control has a vast\nliterature. Reference texts include [9] and [10], the latter being a brief and approachable\ntext for those wishing to acquire the basics rapidly.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Wertz, J. R.

Stark\n\nSchool of Engineering and Material Science, Queen Mary, University of London\n\n10.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nProvision of electrical power for space vehicles is, perhaps, the most fundamental require-\nment for the satellite payload. Power-system failure necessarily results in the loss of\na space mission, and it is interesting to note that many of the early satellite systems\nfailed due to such a loss. The demand for power has increased and is characterized by\nenhanced spacecraft operational complexity and sophistication. The earliest spacecraft,\nsuch as Vanguard 1, typically required a power raising capability of only ?1 W, whereas\ncurrent communications satellites typically require three orders of magnitude greater than\nthis. Evolving trends suggest that a further two orders of magnitude may still be needed.\nHowever, prediction of future power demand must always be treated with a great deal of\ncaution. In the early 1980s there was great focus upon large systems, particularly with\nthe infrastructure elements associated with space stations, containing both manned and\nunmanned elements. The potential for Solar Power Satellite systems (SPS), large orbiting\npower stations generating GW of electrical power for terrestrial use, was investigated in\nmany studies, initially supported in the United States of America by both NASA and\nDoE, and in Europe by the European Space Agency (ESA) [1]. Political and technical\nissues have slowed down such developments, and very little research continues on such\nconcepts [2], even within the context of concern over global warming. Manned systems\ndo require higher power levels, perhaps of the order of 300 kW. Commercial communi-\ncation services and broadcast systems are still seeing a slowly evolving trend to higher\npower levels, but enhanced system performance is reducing power demands. However,\nmuch focus is now also upon smaller satellite systems (see Chapter 18) where cost and\nsystem efficiency are critical system drivers.\n\nThe best methods of raising power can be broadly related to power level and mission\nduration as shown in Figure 10.1. It is apparent that photovoltaic (solar cells) or radioiso-\ntope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are appropriate for the power requirements typical\nof present generation spacecraft, namely, tens of kilowatts for missions of several years.\nFor shorter periods, fuel cells are advantageous, and for periods of less than a few days\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

It is not surprising, therefore, to discover that batteries are\nused in launch vehicles to provide the primary energy source, fuel cells are used in short\nduration missions of the order of a few days (e.g. the Space Shuttle) and both photovoltaic\ndevices and RTG are used for general spacecraft operation, dependent upon the mission.\nIt should be noted that nuclear sources of power such as RTGs and nuclear dynamic\nsystems are used for military applications, but are not generally acceptable for civilian\nvehicles in Earth orbit. Indeed, during the 1990s, an increasing public awareness of envi-\nronmental issues resulted in protests concerning the launch of nuclear-based sources for\nscientific purposes\u2014for example, the launch of the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission. Before\nthe individual elements of a spacecraft power system are considered, the overall power\nsystem configuration will be described briefly.\n\n10.2 POWER SYSTEM ELEMENTS\n\nIn general a spacecraft power system consists of three main elements: primary and\nsecondary energy sources, and a power control/distribution network. These are shown\nschematically in Figure 10.2.\n\nThe primary energy source converts a fuel into electrical power. On early space flights\nand on launch vehicles, batteries have provided this. Strictly these systems do not have\na fuel element, in that a battery is a device that stores energy rather than performing a\ndirect energy conversion process.\n\n\n\nPOWER SYSTEM ELEMENTS 10.2 329\n\nSecondary\n\nBattery\n\nSolar array\n\nPrimary\n\nControl\n\nShunt\nvoltage\nlimiter\n\nCharge\ncontrol\n\nRegulation Spacecraft\nloads\n\nDischarge\nby pass\n\nFigure 10.2 Schematic of typical spacecraft power system block elements\n\nThe majority of present-day spacecraft use a solar array as the primary energy source.\nThe \u2018fuel\u2019 in this case is solar radiant energy, which is converted via the photovoltaic\neffect (see Section 10.3.1) into electrical energy. On manned missions of short duration,\nfuel cells have been used most frequently as the primary source; for longer duration flights\nassociated with space stations such as Mir and ISS, the combination of solar arrays and\nfuel cells has been adopted. These electrochemical devices perform a controlled chemical\nreaction, in such a way that electrical energy may be derived rather than heat energy. The\nfuels used for space operation are hydrogen and oxygen yielding water as the reaction\nproduct: this may then be drunk by astronauts. Nuclear systems utilize either a radioactive\ndecay process (RTG uses this) or a nuclear fission process as the energy source. RTG\nmakes use of the thermoelectric effect, whereas fission reactors operate in a manner similar\nto terrestrial nuclear power plants [4].\n\nThe secondary energy source is required to store energy and subsequently deliver elec-\ntrical power to the satellite system and its payload, when the primary system\u2019s energy\nis not available. The most usual situation when this condition arises is during an eclipse\nperiod when the primary system is a solar array. The eclipse\u2019s duration depends on the\nspacecraft orbit (see Section 5.3.2 of Chapter 5). Typically for Low Earth Orbit (LEO),\na 35-minute eclipse occurs in each orbit for low-inclination satellites: in Geostation-\nary Earth orbit (GEO), eclipses occur only during equinoctial periods, with a maximum\nduration of 1.2 h in a 24-hour period. For such short times, batteries demonstrate the high-\nest efficiency. However, for systems that require high-power levels, typically 100 kW, a\nsolar array/regenerative fuel\u2013cell combination has improved characteristics over a solar\narray/battery combination. Regenerative fuel cells operate in a closed fuel cycle: H2/O2\nfuel is consumed to form water on the \u2018discharge\u2019 cycle and electrolysis of water is per-\nformed during the \u2018charge\u2019 cycle, with power for this being derived from the solar array.\nThe use of regenerative fuel-cells with a solar array has a particular application to lunar\nbase scenarios, resulting in significant mass savings over battery/solar array options [5].\n\nThe power control and distribution network is required to deliver appropriate\nvoltage\u2013current levels to all spacecraft loads when required. Several salient features\nshould be noted.\n\nThe primary power source always degrades during the mission. Thus, at its start an\nexcess of power will be generated, and it is necessary to provide an ancillary load to\n\n\n\n330 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\ndissipate it. The simplest way to do this is to use a resistive load, generally external to\nthe main spacecraft structure in order to simplify the thermal design.\n\nBoth primary and secondary power system characteristics will change during the mis-\nsion, leading to a requirement for voltage and/or current regulation. The changes arise due\nto both degradation effects, such as cell failures, and also illumination variations caused\nby changing solar array aspect angles with respect to the Sun. The customary approach\nis to use a voltage shunt regulator across the array.\n\nCharge control of a battery system is particularly important to maintain the lifetime\nand reliability of battery units. It generally necessitates both current and voltage control.\nA variety of techniques may be used to sample the state of a battery and these will be dis-\ncussed in Section 10.5. Discharge control is also required in order to limit current output.\n\nThis chapter provides an overview of each of these systems. For further detailed infor-\nmation, the reader is referred to two texts dedicated to spacecraft power systems [6, 7].\n\n10.3 PRIMARY POWER SYSTEMS\n\n10.3.1 Solar arrays\n\nA solar array is an assembly of many thousand individual solar cells, connected in a suit-\nable way to provide dc power levels from a few watts to tens of kilowatts. For a detailed\ndescription of both terrestrial and space solar arrays, Rauschenbach [8] is recommended.\n\nEach solar cell assembly has a semiconductor p ? n junction as shown schematically\nin Figure 10.3. For spacecraft applications, the base material typically has a resistivity of\nbetween 10?3 and 102 ? cm. Using silicon, for example, it might be doped with boron to\nform the p-type material (electron deficient), and with phosphorous for the n-type material\n(electron excess).\n\nWith no illumination, the junction achieves an equilibrium state in which no current\nflows. But when it is illuminated with suitable radiation, photons with sufficient energy\nwill create electron\u2013hole pairs, and the radiation is converted to a potential across the\ncell with usable electrical power. The incident photon energy needed for this must exceed\na band gap that depends upon the material, as shown in Table 10.1. Photons with excess\nenergy dissipate it as heat within the cell, leading to reduced efficiency.\n\nCover slip\n\nInterconnect\n\nSubstrate\n\nRear side wire\n\nAdhesive\n\nAdhesive\n\nn\np\n\nFigure 10.3 Schematic of a typical solar cell assembly\n\n\n\nPRIMARY POWER SYSTEMS 10.3 331\n\nTable 10.1 Properties of semiconductor materials\n\nMaterial Band gap (eV) Maximum wavelength(?m)\n\nSi 1.12 1.12\nCdS 1.2 1.03\nGaAs 1.35 0.92\nGaP 2.24 0.554\nCdTe 2.1 0.59\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt c\n\nur\nre\n\nnt\n (\n\nm\nA\n\n)\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nIllumination\nlevel\n\nMaximum\npower point\n\n125 mW/cm2\n\n100 mW/cm2\n\n80\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\n\nOutput voltage (V)\n\n0.5 0.6 0.7\nVopen circuit\n\nsh\nor\n\nt c\nirc\n\nui\nt\n\nFigure 10.4 Current\u2013voltage characteristic for a typical solar cell.

Typically open-\ncircuit voltages for silicon cells lie between 0.5 and 0.6 V under solar illumination. The\nplot of power against voltage (Figure 10.5) has a clear maximum, with a particularly rapid\nfall once the optimum voltage is exceeded. On some spacecraft maximum-power-point\ntracking is used to operate the array most efficiently. Increase in cell temperature results in\ndecreasing open-circuit voltage with only a modest increase in short-circuit current. The\ntheoretical maximum efficiency of both silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) cells is\nshown as a function of temperature in Figure 10.6. It shows the particular sensitivity of Si\nto temperature and also the improved performance of GaAs at high temperatures. GaAs is\nincreasingly replacing Si as the material selected for satellite solar arrays, as for example\n\n\n\n332 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt p\n\now\ner\n\nOutput voltage\n\nMaximum power\npoint\n\nVmp\n\nP?\nV \n\ncu\nrv\n\ne\n\nFigure 10.5 Power\u2013voltage characteristic for a typical solar cell (From Solar Cell Array\nDesign Handbook by Rauschenbach, H.

Triple junction GaAs technology can currently achieve an efficiency of\nbetween 28% and 30% in production level cells. The high temperature potential for\nefficient energy conversion with GaAs identifies the potential use of a focusing optical\narrangement for GaAs cells such that these cells may be illuminated by an intensity\ngreater than the nominal radiation intensity of 1.4 kW/m2 in Earth orbit. Fewer cells\nwould then be required to provide a given power level, which could result in array cost\nreductions since the cell cost is a large proportion of the total cost. Concentration ratios\nas high as 100 : 1 for GaAs cells have been investigated in such studies. Systems have\n\n\n\nPRIMARY POWER SYSTEMS 10.3 333\n\nbeen flown, for example the Deep Space 1 mission (1998), that had a concentration\nratio of 8. Improvements in design since then have identified the capability for greatly\nimproved specific power (300 W/kg), benefiting additionally from increased screening\nfrom damaging radiation (see below) making such arrays suitable for operation in the\nJovian environment [9].\n\nThe n-type contact on the upper surface of the cell is in the form of a multiple-finger\narrangement. These fingers are required for efficient current collection, whilst maintaining\ngood optical transparency (typically ?60% ). They are connected at a bar, along one edge\nof the cell. Frequently titanium/silver (Ti/Ag) is used for this.\n\nRadiation damage is a problem with solar cells. In general, Si cells having higher base\nresistivity (?10 ? cm) are the most tolerant of radiation. However, cells with a lower base\nresistance (?2 ? cm) have a higher short circuit voltage, leading to fewer cells in series\nto achieve the operational voltage. Selection of material is therefore mission dependent.\nFurthermore, cells have the n-type material uppermost, since on early space flights it was\ndiscovered that cells having the p-type material as the upper region rapidly suffered from\nradiation damage. Thin cells suffer less than thicker ones, but at present they have a lower\nconversion efficiency. GaAs cells are more radiation tolerant than Si and for this reason\nthere is considerable interest and effort in their development.\n\nThe cover glass provides environmental and radiation protection. For design purposes,\nthe particle fluence of a spacecraft\u2019s radiation environment may be expressed as an equiv-\nalent fluence of monoenergetic 1 MeV electrons (see Figure 10.7). Degradation of cell\noutput to this irradiation is generally available from manufacturers\u2019 data; Figure 10.8\nshows typical degradation curves for cells with a variety of thicknesses.\n\nThe effectiveness of the cover glass depends on its density and thickness. Suitable\nglass microsheet is commercially available in several thicknesses from 50 ?m to 500 ?m\n[10]. Their absorption of radiation follows approximately an exponential law, so that the\nintensity of radiation after traversing a depth x into the glass is\n\nI ? I0e?k?x (10.1)\n\nwhere I0 is the initial radiation fluence at x = 0, ? is the density of material and k\nis an energy-dependent absorption coefficient. For fused silica, Figure 10.9 shows the\neffect of changing glass thickness. It should be noted that in order to evaluate the total\nradiation fluence absorbed by the solar cell, both front-side and rear-side fluences must be\ncalculated. On rigid panel arrays mounted on honeycomb structure, and on solar arrays\nbonded to the spacecraft wall (e.g. spinning spacecraft) the rear side is effectively screened\nfrom radiation, whilst on lightweight arrays this is not the case. Using the data supplied in\nFigures 10.7\u201310.9, it is possible to derive the area of active solar cells required to meet a\nspecific mission requirement of end of life (EOL) performance. Suppose that an output of\n1 kW is required at EOL for a satellite in a circular, equatorial orbit at 1000 km altitude.\nAssume that the cell to be used is made of silicon, 150 ?m thick, having the properties\nshown in Figure 10.8. The mission duration is to be 5 years. Note that in the discussion\nthat follows, the numerical values are approximate.\n\nThe starting point is to use Figure 10.7 to find the total damage equivalent 1 MeV\nelectron fluence for a cell protected by a 150 ?m cover slip. At 1000 km, this Figure\nshows that the damage equivalent due to protons is 1.7 \u00d7 1014 electrons/cm/year and\nthat due to electrons is 2 \u00d7 1012 electrons/cm/year. The total flux in 5 years is therefore\n\n\n\n334 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\n1018\n\n1017\n\n1016\n\n1015\n\n1014\n\n1013\n\n1012\n\n1011\n102 103 104\n\nAltitude (km)\n\nD\nam\n\nag\ne \n\neq\nui\n\nva\nle\n\nnt\n 1\n\n M\neV\n\n fl\nue\n\nnc\ne \n\n( \ne/\n\ncm\n2 /\n\nyr\n)\n\n105\n\nOrbit\ninclination\n(deg)\n\n0\n30\n\n60\n90\n\nProtons\n\n0\u00b0\n30\u00b0\n60\u00b0\n90\u00b0\n\nElectrons\n\nE\n\nFigure 10.7 Damage equivalent 1 MeV fluence caused by electrons and protons due to\ntrapped particles, to silicon cells protected by 150 ?m fused silica covers and infinitely\nthick rear shielding [8] (From Solar Cell Array Design Handbook by Rauschenbach, H.

It is evident that the\ndamage due to protons is much greater than that from electrons, as noted in Section 2.3\nof Chapter 2. From Figure 10.8, the power per unit area is 11.5 mW /cm2. It is however,\nnoticeable from this Figure that a significant deterioration in the performance of the cell is\nevident at such a high radiation dose. A reduction in dose may be achieved by increasing\nthe cover slip thickness. For example, if a cover slip of 500 ?m were to be used, then the\nflux will be reduced according to the data presented in Figure 10.9 by a factor of 0.6.\nThus the expected radiation dose absorbed in the cell after 5 years would then only be\n5.2 \u00d7 1014 electrons/cm, yielding an EOL performance of 12 mW/cm2, an improvement of\napproximately 4%. The mass increase associated with the use of this cover slip, assuming\nas a first approximation that the density of the cover slip is the same as that of the cell, will\nbe (mass of 500 ?m cover slip plus 150 ?m cell)/(mass of 150 ?m cover slip plus 150 ?m\ncell), equivalent to a factor of nearly 2.2. This increase in mass needs to be considered\nhowever alongside the cost increase associated with the alternative of a 4% increase in\nthe number of cells. The thinner cover slips result in an active area of (1000/0.0115) cm2,\nor 8.7 m2, whilst the thicker protection requires an area of only 8.3 m2.\n\nAdditional features required of the cover glass are that it provides good optical coupling\nbetween free space and glass and also between glass and adhesive, and that it provides\nsuitable wavelength selection, limiting the UV flux to the adhesive layer and the cell. These\nfeatures are achieved using an anti-reflection coating, such as magnesium fluoride on the\nupper surface, perhaps with an additional indium oxide conductive coating as described in\nChapter 2. A UV-filter coating may be applied to the underside of the cell, to reflect UV\nradiation. For a cover glass with cerium doping, additional UV filtering is unnecessary.\n\nFor efficient cell operation and insensitivity to radiation, a shallow junction depth (typ-\nically less than 10 ?m) is required. Various Si cell configurations have been investigated\nto improve conversion efficiency. These include the following:\n\n\u2022 Back-surface reflectors (BSRs), used, for example, on the ISS and the Spot series of\nspacecraft, to reflect unabsorbed radiation from the rear side of the (p)-region back\nthrough the cell.

This exhibits higher output due to enhanced carrier collection efficiency,\nbut the improvement is lost under high fluence damage. This technology has been\nused on the array for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Envisat.\n\n\u2022 The use of a textured front surface of the cell reduces reflection from the cell surface.\n\n\n\nPRIMARY POWER SYSTEMS 10.3 337\n\nSolar arrays using Si cells are made from individual cells that historically have been\nrectangular, 2 cm \u00d7 4 cm, having a conversion efficiency of ?12 to 14%. To improve\npacking efficiency, much work on high-efficiency large area Si cells has been completed,\nwith beginning of life efficiency in excess of 20%. The cells used on ISS are 8 cm square\nwith an efficiency of ?13% [11]. The cells have a thickness of between 50 and 250 ?m,\n?200 ?m being used for the majority of arrays. Silicon cells having a thickness of 50 ?m\nare now able to convert with a power density of 120 W/m2; thinner GaAs cells ?5 ?m\nhave a beginning of life efficiency of ?28%, with 25% at the end of life for a 15 year\nGEO-type mission. There is much development now on highly efficient multi-junction\nthin film cells. Whilst the intrinsic efficiency of such cells is lower (of order ?10?15%),\nthe specific power is greatly improved with figures quoted as high as 1000 W/kg [12].\nFurther emphasis on thin film technology for solar arrays is continuing as reported through\nthe Space Photovoltaics Research and Technology Conference series [13].\n\nInterconnections between cells represent a major array failure hazard. This arises\nbecause of the thermal cycling inherent upon entry/departure from sunlight to eclipse.\nSince the materials used for cell and substrate are different, differential expansion\ntakes place during the rapid temperature change (?100?C in a few minutes). Thermal\nstress-relieving loops are required to reduce such failure mechanisms as interconnect\nlift-off and fracture.\n\nAtomic oxygen effects on exposed interconnects have been mentioned earlier, in\nChapter 2. A particular problem of the solar cell interconnection is that historically\nthese have always been made of thin silver foil. Silver has a high capture efficiency\nfor atomic oxygen, resulting in the formation of a variety of silver oxides. The process\nresults in thinning due to flake-off of the oxides and hence an increase in interconnection\nresistivity. This leads to a loss of power. In the case of the HST array, the interconnects\nwere originally designed to be pure silver. The delay in the original launch date (because\nof the Challenger accident) permitted a redesign in which silver was used only as a\nsurface layer on a molybdenum interconnect. During flight, the silver eroded revealing\nthe molybdenum, which is oxidation resistant. The power output from the array was thus\nmaintained at the predicted value for the life of the mission.\n\nA variety of substrate materials have been used and proven in space. Frequently Kapton\nwith glass- or carbon- fibre reinforcement, ?100 ?m thick, forms the immediate interface\nwith the cell, which may be mounted on a honeycomb panel for rigidity (e.g. Tracking\nand Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) solar array). Flexible cell blankets have also been used\nto reduce mass. The original HST solar array was a typical example, with glass fibre\nreinforcing the Kapton. In general, for the largest arrays, flexible substrate materials offer\nmass savings. But it is interesting to note that early work [14] has shown that for power\nlevels up to 6 kW, mass savings occur when using advanced rigid arrays, wherein Kapton\nis reinforced with carbon fibre. Dutch Space has continued the development of advanced\nrigid solar arrays using both Si and GaAs, with in-orbit power (beginning of life (BOL))\nin excess of 8 kW.\n\nAs noted earlier, individual cells produce power at a voltage of ?0.5 V, and it is\nnecessary to connect many cells in series. Reliability is then achieved by additional\nparallel coupling at each cell; typically three or four cells form a parallel combination.\nThis series\u2013parallel arrangement is called a solar cell string . Further protection is afforded\nusing shunt diodes that provide current bypass paths should individual cells become\nshadowed. Shadowing can cause cell failures since if a cell is unable to generate power\n\n\n\n338 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\nbecause of loss of illumination, then the entire string voltage may appear as a reverse\nbias voltage across the cell.\n\nSystem level interactions\n\nNow consider the system level interactions between the solar array design and the vehicle\nitself. The relatively low conversion efficiency of an array results in the need for large\nareas of solar cells to intercept sufficient solar radiation for the power demand. Examples\nof typical array configurations, associated with generic stabilization types are illustrated\nin Chapter 9.\n\nFor a spinning satellite, using either dual spin or simple spin ACS, the \u2018drum\u2019 size\nevidently limits the power that can be generated. The drum itself is limited by the launch\nvolume. A possible solution is to introduce an additional mechanism such as the \u2018drop\nskirt\u2019 as used on Intelsat VI, where a larger-diameter hollow cylinder is deployed to\nexpose additional cell area. Thruster plume impingement in such a configuration can,\nhowever, cause both disturbance torques and contamination.\n\nOther aspects to note for the spinning satellite solar array are coupled with the thermal\nenvironment. Assuming a typical spin rate of ?50 rpm, the average temperature of the\narray can be maintained at a lower value than for the three-axis configuration. This leads\nto an increased efficiency of the individual cells, and thus a decrease in the required active\ncell area. However, since not all the array is instantaneously illuminated, a factor of ??\ntimes the number of cells is required for the same collected power. Since also on the\nspinner, the array is mounted essentially on the body of the spacecraft, the temperature\nexcursions noted on the array (between sunlit and eclipse phases) are reduced, having a\nsignificant impact on reducing the thermal shock characteristic of a three-axis deployed\nsolar array.\n\nConsidering the three-axis-stabilized satellite, the solar array requires a mechanism to\ndeploy the stowed array following launch and then orientate it appropriately to track the\nSun. These deployment mechanisms may be of a simple extending telescopic construction,\nor of the \u2018Coilable\u2019 variety (See Chapter 15). In the Astromast, the carbon-fibre members\nof the mast are deformed by coiling them into a stowage container. They may then be\ndriven out by a screw mechanism to the un-deformed (extended) configuration.\n\nTensioning wires are then required to achieve an acceptable minimum fundamental\nfrequency of the array largely because of AOCS requirements. On three-axis-stabilized\nvehicles, power take-off from the array generally, but not always, requires a rotary degree\nof freedom between the satellite and the array, in order that pointing requirements of the\narray and the payload may be met. This requires two elements\u2014the mechanical rotation\ndevice to allow the body to move relative to the array (with appropriate sensing systems)\nand an electrical power take-off device (See Chapter 15). The provision of power using\na solar array clearly has many design interactions with the rest of the spacecraft system.\n\nTable 10.2 summarizes performance characteristics for several solar arrays. A method\nfor array sizing is given in Section 10.6.\n\n10.3.2 Fuel cells\n\nFuel cells provided the primary power source for the Shuttle orbiter. Originally they were\ndesigned as part of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo US manned missions.

From a system viewpoint, a major advantage is\nits flexibility. For example, it provides power during both sunlit and eclipse periods, and\nthe fuel has a high-energy density and thus provides a compact solution compared with\na solar array. The evident disadvantage is the need to carry fuel.\n\nThe hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell has been used for space applications, a product of the\nreaction being water. This is clearly useful for manned missions. A schematic diagram of\nsuch a cell is shown in Figure 10.10. This technology has also been proposed for lunar\nbase requirements in association with solar arrays [5] and lunar rovers [15].\n\nThe voltage that appears at the terminals of an ideal cell is given by\n\nEr = ??G\nnF\n\n(10.2)\n\nwhere ?G is the change of Gibbs free energy occurring in the reaction, n is the number\nof electrons transferred and F is the Faraday constant (product of Avogadro number\nand elementary charge) equal to 9.65 \u00d7 104 C/mol. For the reaction of the H2/O2 cell,\ntwo electrons are transferred per mole of water formed and ?G has the value of\n?237.2 kJ/mole at 25?C. The reaction takes place spontaneously.\n\nThus the reversible voltage of the ideal cell is 237.2 \u00d7 103/(2 \u00d7 9.65 \u00d7 104) = 1.229 V.\nIn practice this is not realized because there are various irreversibilities, termed polar-\n\nization losses.

Initially, as soon as a current is drawn from the cell, a rapid drop in voltage\noccurs. This is associated with the energy required to activate the electrode reactions.\nFor the H2/O2 fuel cell these are three-phase: gas (fuel), solid (electrode) and liquid\n(electrolyte\u2014this can also be a solid). It is necessary for the reactants to be chemisorbed\nonto the electrode, a process that requires breaking and forming new chemical bonds,\nand energy; hence the voltage drops. The process is called activation polarization. The\nmagnitude of voltage drop is given by the Tafel equation:\n\n?VACT = a + b ln J (10.3)\nwhere J is the current density at the electrodes, and a and b are temperature-dependent\nconstants for the reaction/surface description.\n\nAs the current drawn increases, a linear voltage\u2013current relation is noted. This is simply\nbecause of the resistive nature of the electrolyte.\n\nAt high current values problems arise because of the transport of reactants to the\nreaction sites, a feature that is particularly important at porous electrodes since pressure\ngradients are set up that limit flow rates. Additionally, species concentrations are not\nuniform and thus ionic species can create a back emf. This concentration polarization\nprovides the ultimate limit on current density that may be achieved by a fuel cell. All of\nthese electrochemical polarization processes are common to both batteries and fuel cells,\nand their voltage\u2013current characteristics are very similar.\n\nEarly fuel-cell systems were primarily based upon the technology of solid polymer\nelectrolyte (SPE). For the Gemini series, 1 kW was produced at a specific power of\n33 W/kg, within a volume of 0.05 m3, and the objective to extend missions to greater\nthan four days was achieved. However, the water produced was not of drinking quality\nbecause of degradation of the fuel-cell membrane.\n\nThe Apollo system, also used for Skylab, was based upon matrix aqueous alkaline\ntechnology and achieved a power level of 1.5 kW at a specific power of 25 W/kg. It had\nto operate whilst the vehicle was on the lunar surface, at a temperature greater than 394 K.\nThe selected system, a Bacon fuel cell, operated at 505 K.\n\nShuttle developments, also based upon the alkaline technology, improved the specific\npower by an order of magnitude, ?12 kW, 275 W/kg. Further, the start-up time for this\ncell was 15 min with shutdown being instantaneous, whereas for Apollo, 24-hour start-up\nperiods were required with 17-hour shutdown. Table 10.3 summarizes past and present\nfuel-cell status. Regenerative fuel cells wherein water is also electrolysed are not yet\nspace-proven.\n\n10.3.3 Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG)\n\nFor deep-space missions, the use of fuel cells is precluded by their long duration. Solar\narrays produce less power as they move away from the Sun, by a factor of approximately\n(rE/rS/C)1.5, where rS/C and rE are the distances from the Sun to the spacecraft and to\nthe Earth respectively. This factor comes about from the combined effect of the reduction\nin the intensity of the illumination from the Sun as the spacecraft moves away from it,\npartly offset by the beneficial effect of the reduction in the temperature of the solar cells.\n\nFor spacecraft travelling further than Jupiter solar arrays show disadvantages from a\nsystem viewpoint, compared with radioisotope generators.\n\n\n\n342 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\nThe operation of a RTG is based on the thermoelectric effect noted by Seebeck, that\nit is possible to generate a voltage between two materials, A and B (either conductors\nor semiconductors) if a temperature difference is maintained (see Figure 10.12). This is\nanalogous to a thermocouple. Practical RTG space systems utilize two semiconductor\nmaterials\u2014one p-type, the other n-type\u2014in order to exploit the effect.\n\nThe power output from such a device is a function of the absolute temperature of the\nhot junction, the temperature difference that may be maintained between the junctions\nand also the properties of the materials. Because such devices are relatively inefficient\n(less than 10%), one major problem in their design is removing waste heat.\n\nThe heat source used in space systems is derived from the spontaneous decay of a\nradioactive material. As this decays, it emits high-energy particles that can lose part of\ntheir energy in heating absorbing materials. Suitable fuels are listed in Table 10.4, which\nshows the half-life (?1/2) for each of the fuels, namely, the time required for the amount\nof a given radioactive isotope in a sample to halve.

For these\nmissions Plutonium is used exclusively.\n\nThe advantages of RTGs over other systems include the following:\n\n1. They provide independence of power production from spacecraft orientation and\nshadowing.\n\n2. They provide independence of distance from the Sun (deep-space missions are\npossible).\n\n3. They can provide low power levels for long periods of time.\n4. They are not susceptible to radiation damage in the Van Allen belts.\n5. They are suitable for missions with long eclipse periods, for example, lunar landers.\n\nThe disadvantages of RTG systems need also be considered, and include\n\n1. They adversely affect the radiation environment of the satellite whilst in orbit.\nThis will influence the spacecraft configuration significantly as may be seen from\nFigure 10.13, which shows the Galileo spacecraft. In this instance, the RTG needs\nto be deployed on a lengthy boom away from the main satellite bus.\n\n2. Careful handling procedures are required during satellite integration owing to the\nradiation hazard posed by the radioactive source.\n\n3. High temperature operation is required for efficient energy conversion. This impacts\nupon the thermal environment of the vehicle, and again on vehicle configuration.\n\n4.

At the political level there has been increasing concern expressed at the inclusion\nof radioactive material on board a satellite. This is principally of concern because\nof the potential for such a source to be dispersed in the atmosphere, should there be\na launch failure.\n\nSystem for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP-19), which powered the Viking lander\nvehicle to Mars, had a specific power of 2.2 W/kg, with a thermal/electric efficiency of\n?5%. The output electrical power was 35 W. Table 10.5 summarizes data on RTG systems.\n\n10.3.4 Other primary power systems\n\nTwo other primary power systems have been developed for operation\u2014nuclear fission and\nsolar heat. The former has been extensively used in the former Soviet space programme for\nmilitary purposes. The latter has not flown in space yet, but a substantial effort has taken\nplace in recent years in developing such systems for potential use on the International\nSpace Station.\n\nNuclear fission systems\n\nThese systems operate in a similar way to conventional ground-based nuclear power\nstations, in that fissile material such as uranium-235 is used as a heat source. In space\nsystems, this is used to drive a thermoelectric converter as noted in the preceding section.\nSpecific features of space-based systems relate to the fail-safe requirement, particularly\nduring launch.\n\nWhilst the USA has invested substantially in the SNAP systems (even number SNAP\ndesignates a reactor system), these have not been used regularly. The main focus of their\nactivity in recent years has been on the SP100 system [17]. It is notable, however, that\nthe purchase of Russian technology by the US suggests that this US programme may not\nbe pursued vigorously in the future.\n\nSolar heat systems\n\nThe use of solar energy directly in the form of heat can provide system advantages.\nThe heat energy can be used to drive a heat engine and then a rotary converter to elec-\ntricity (solar dynamic), or directly be used as a heat source for a thermoelectric converter\n(solar thermoelectric).\n\n\n\nSECONDARY POWER SYSTEMS: BATTERIES 10.4 345\n\nSolar\ninput\n\nReceiver Turbine Compressor\nHeat\n\nrejection\n\nRecuperator\n\nAlternator\n\nElectrical\noutput\n\nFigure 10.14 Solar dynamic Brayton cycle\n\nSolar dynamic systems have had the greatest concentration of effort for the ISS. Design\nstudies show that their end-to-end conversion efficiency is approximately 25% greater\nthan for photovoltaics. This results in a reduced need for deployed collection area by\nabout 25%, and consequently in reduced aerodynamic drag for LEO satellites. In the\noriginal concept for the ISS, primary power for the initial in-orbit capability was to be\n75 kW, derived from photovoltaics. Power expansion was then assumed to be provided\nby solar dynamics in two units of 25 kW.\n\nSolar dynamic systems, resulting in less drag, lead to lower fuel usage for orbit mainte-\nnance. This reduces the cost of station operation, principally by reducing the demand for\nrefuelling flights. An additional cost benefit arises from the lower maintenance costs envis-\naged for solar dynamic systems compared with photovoltaic systems. Over the lifetime\nof the Space Station, cost savings of several billions of dollars have been identified [18].\n\nThe concept studied by NASA, and which was the original baseline for the ISS solar\ndynamic system, is based upon the Brayton Cycle engine [18]. A block diagram of this\nis shown in Figure 10.14. The working fluid for this all-gas phase cycle is helium and\nxenon in such a proportion that the equivalent molecular weight is 40. This all-gas phase\ncycle minimizes problems of handling wet vapours (leading to erosion) and gravitational\neffects in transporting fluids. Storage of power within the concept was to be performed\nthermally, using the latent heat of fusion for a lithium fluoride/calcium fluoride mixture.\nThis phase change occurs at 1042 K. Storing power in this way provides mass savings\ncompared to battery technology, because of the high quality (temperature) heat energy.\n\nFunding problems for the ISS have led to a cancellation of the power extension require-\nments. There has, however, been recent ongoing research through NASA, associated with\nthe Constellation programme. This has led to revaluation of advanced radioisotope power\nconversion technologies wherein a radioisotope output is harnessed to thermoelectric,\nBrayton and Stirling cycle options.\n\n10.4 SECONDARY POWER SYSTEMS: BATTERIES\n\nBatteries have been used extensively for the secondary power system, providing power\nduring periods when the primary one is not available. As a back-up for a solar array\n\n\n\n346 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\nthis means that the batteries must provide power during eclipses, and that the array must\nrecharge the batteries in sunlight.\n\nIn GEO operations, eclipses only occur during the two equinoctial periods producing\neclipse seasons for the spacecraft. These last about 45 days at each equinox. Initially they\nare short (? minutes), but lengthen to a maximum of 1.2 h before decreasing again. The\ntotal of ?90 eclipses, thus, occur irregularly with significant periods of time when no\nbattery operation is required. With more than 22 h of sunlight available in each orbit, a\ntrickle charge solution is possible.\n\nIn LEO, on the other hand, the spacecraft may be in eclipse and thus require bat-\ntery power for 40% of each orbit. Although the precise duration will depend on orbit\ninclination, it is fairly regular, and the eclipse cycle results in typically 5000 to 6000\ncharge/discharge cycles of the battery per year. This results in the array-power sizing\nneeding to be nearly twice the nominal load requirement (see Section 10.6).\n\nIn summary, LEO operations require a large number of low-depth discharges, whereas\nin GEO a few deep discharges suffice. This inevitably influences battery type, result-\ning in the past trend of using nickel-cadmium (Ni\u2013Cd) or silver\u2013zinc (Ag\u2013Zn) cells\nfor LEO operation and nickel\u2013hydrogen (Ni\u2013H2) cells for GEO operations. Cell cycle\nlife, specific mass (kW h/kg) and volume (kW h/m3) all influence the acceptability of a\nparticular battery technology. However, work on the other materials, particularly Li-ion\nand Li\u2013SO2, is continuing [19] and alternative technologies continue to be implemented\non spacecraft (see, for example, the annual Goddard Space Flight Centre (GSFC) battery\nworkshop proceedings [20]); see Table 10.6 for present battery technology performance\ncharacteristics. The use of Li-Ion battery technology has come to the fore in recent years,\nand its use in scientific and application satellites alike has become increasingly common\nand is indeed the baseline for the Eurostar 3000 platform.\n\nA rather specialist battery requirement specification led to the Li\u2013SO2 battery system\nthat was used to power the Huygens probe, for the period of the mission following\nseparation from the Cassini Saturn orbiter. This separation occurred in January 2005,\nand followed a period of seven years when the probe had been in hibernation. The\nbattery was then required to provide power during a low-power coast of 22 h, followed\nby a high-power load for 2.5 h during the descent through Titan\u2019s atmosphere. The design\nrequirements were for the probe to remain operational for 30 min on the surface. However,\nthe battery continued to power the probe for 70 m. For this, the overall battery system\ncontained five individual battery units. Each of these consisted of two modules of 13\nLi\u2013SO2 cells in series. Each cell had a capacity of 7.5 A-h.\n\nThe detailed electrochemistry of batteries is covered in References [21] and [22]. The\nmain function of battery operation, which is of importance to spacecraft design, is the way\nin which the reliability and charge efficiency are related to charge control. Parameters of\ncritical importance are the charge/discharge rate, the depth of discharge (DOD), the extent\nof overcharging and the thermal sensitivity to each of these parameters. The associated\nrelationship between performance and control environment is a feature common to all\nbattery technologies, although some are more sensitive than others; this is particularly\nso for Ni\u2013Cd technology which historically has been used on many spacecraft. The\ntechnology that is now becoming the baseline for many missions however is the Li-ion\nbased battery. This was first flown as a primary battery in 2001 on the ESA Proba-1\nmission that operated in LEO [24], and far exceeded the cycle life performance. This\ntechnology, in addition to offering high specific power, is also capable of being operated\n\n\n\nPOWER MANAGEMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL 10.5 347\n\nTable 10.6 Performance of battery technologies for space use [23]\n\nType Specific energy (W h/kg) Mission examples\n\nNi-Cd 28\u201334 Sampex\nNi-H2 30\u201354 Odyssey\nAg-Zn 100 Pathfinder\nLi-Ion 90 MER Rover\nLi-SO2 90\u2013150 Galileo\nLi-SOCL2 200\u2013250 Sojourner\n\nTable 10.7 Hubble space telescope (HST), Intelsat VII and Eurostar\n3000 battery summary\n\nParameter HST Intelsat VII Eurostar 3000\n\nTechnology Ni-H2 Ni-H2 Li-ion\nSpecific energy (W h/kg) 57.14 61.26 175\nCapacity (A-h) 96 91.5 50\nCell dimensions:\n\nDiameter (cm) 9.03 8.89 5.3\nLength (cm) 23.62 23.67 25.0\n\nCell mass (kg) 2.1 1.867 1.1\n\nat high depth of discharge with a large number of cycles. It has been adopted for GEO\nspacecraft and is the adopted battery technology for the Eurostar 3000 platform, in which\nit is designed to operate with a depth of discharge of 80%. This far exceeds that of\nNi\u2013H2 technology which typically operates with a DOD of ?50%. The resulting battery\nhas a specific power greater than 110 W h/kg, and due to the deeper discharge provides\nadditional mass saving. The performance of the cells used on Eurostar 3000 is shown in\nTable 10.7, which also includes data for the Ni\u2013H2 batteries for HST and Intelsat VII.\n\n10.5 POWER MANAGEMENT, DISTRIBUTION\n\nAND CONTROL\n\nThe basic features of power control were outlined in Section 10.2. A key aspect of the\npower management system is that it must be designed to operate with both a primary\nand a secondary power system whose characteristics are changing with time as outlined\nin the previous sections. Several philosophies for power management are outlined in\nFigure 10.15.\n\nThe electrical \u2018bus\u2019 may be required to provide a variety of voltages to meet the needs\nof the various equipment. Generally within Europe, the trend has been to have a regulated\ndc power bus, typically at 28, 50 or 100 V (ECSS-E-ST-20C). For example, the bus of the\nsecond generation Meteosat system has a bus voltage of 28.2 V \u00b1 1%, and for Artemis it is\n42.5 \u00b1 0.5 V. Both of these satellites were designed in Europe. In contrast, US spacecraft\ngenerally use unregulated buses; for example, the NASA standard for unmanned spacecraft\nprovides a voltage in the range 21 to 35 V dc. Present spacecraft are being designed with\n\n\n\n348 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\nSolar array\n\nBattery\ndischarge\nregulator\n\nBattery\ncharge\n\nregulator\n\nBattery\ncharge\n\nregulator\n\nShunt\nregulator\n\n(SR)\n\nShunt\nregulator\n\n(SR)\n\nShunt\nregulator\n\n(SR)\n\nBatteries\n\nBatteries\n\nBatteries\n\nUnregulated\nbus\n\nQuasi-regulated\nbus\n\nRegulated\nbus\n\nSolar array\n\nSolar array\n\nFigure 10.15 Schematic bus concepts\n\nhigher bus voltages (?150 V) to reduce resistive losses and harness mass; for example,\nthe nominal bus voltage for the ISS is 160 V. For both regulated and unregulated systems,\ndc\u2013dc converters are required to provide the variety of voltages needed; this conversion\nfrequently takes place at equipment level rather than centrally.\n\nAn ac bus is sometimes used to augment the dc one. The hybrid system can provide\nmass savings due to both the simplicity of conversion from ac to a variety of dc levels, and\nalso the fact that it is possible to run the power distribution harness at higher voltages if an\nac supply is used. Indeed it has been noted [25], that the equivalent wiring cross-section\nis six times smaller for a three-phase ac network than for a dc one. An ac distribution is\nmainly applicable to high-power spacecraft and where a large number of dc voltages are\nrequired at equipment level. The voltages in ac buses generally have a square waveform,\nan example being Hipparcos. A notable exception was on the Shuttle Space-lab, where\nthe ac bus was more sophisticated, providing a three-phase sinusoidal voltage at 400 Hz.\n\nAs noted above, the bus can be either regulated or unregulated; in some circumstances\nit can be quasi-regulated. The fully regulated bus provides voltage regulation during both\nnormal sunlight operation (battery charge cycle) and during an eclipse (discharge cycle).\nWith quasi-regulation, the regulation occurs only during sunlight operation.\n\nThe primary units\n\nThe main units used in a power system are described below for a typical configuration\nused on European communications spacecraft. The terminology may differ slightly for\nUS spacecraft. Figure 10.16 shows the overall power system layout.\n\n\n\nPOWER MANAGEMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL 10.5 349\n\nSPA (1)\n\nSPA (2)\n\nSPA (3)\n\nSPA (n)\n\nPower\ntransfer\ndevice\n\nShunt\nregulator\n\nPCDU\nMain bus\n\nBMU BCR MCU\nBDRBDR control\n\nBattery pack\n\nOverload detect\n\nBattery status data\n\nswitches\n\nSun\n\nState\n\nData/control line\n\nPower line\n\nHeater\nbus\n\nCharge\nrate\n\nSolar array\n\nFigure 10.16 Power system layout\n\n\u2022 Array regulator . As the power available from an array varies during a mission, or the\npower demanded by the payload varies, it is possible to switch in or out segments of\nthe solar array. Switching out is achieved by grounding the individual segments in\nthe shunt regulator module. The array itself can be structured into various modules,\nsometimes called solar power assemblies (SPA). The regulation of power output\nfrom the array bus is typically achieved by using either a pulse-width modulation\nscheme, or a sequential switching-shunt regulation, known as S3R [26]. A consider-\nable number of satellites have used this latter approach. The voltage sensing that is\nused to control the shunt regulator module is termed the mode control unit (MCU).\nAn additional strategy used on some spacecraft is maximum power-point tracking.\nAs can be seen from Figure 10.5, the power output from an individual cell shows a\ndistinct maximum. Maximum power-point trackers control the operating point of a\nstring of cells by varying the voltage at which the string operates. As an example [27]\nof a solar array regulator, the unit on the Artemis satellite, which has a sunlight load\nof 3.3 kW and an eclipse load of 2 kW, provides shunt regulation. This regulator has\na mass of 6.5 kg and dissipates 117 W at a nominal load of 2.65 kW. During eclipse\noperations the regulator requires 18 W.\n\n\n\n350 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Battery control . Three units are typically associated with battery control. These\nare the battery management unit (BMU), the battery charge regulator (BCR) and\nthe battery discharge regulator (BDR). The BMU\u2019s functions are to monitor the\nbattery\u2019s temperature and voltage as well as individual cell voltages, pressures and\ntemperatures. It is the interface between the power subsystem and the data-handling\nsubsystem, and also provides control inputs to the charge regulation of the batteries,\ncarried out by the BCR. The principal function of the BCR is to provide a constant\ncurrent charge of the battery during sunlight operation, whilst that of the BDR is\nto supply a constant current to the spacecraft bus during eclipse operation. Control\nof this current is derived from the MCU, typically with further protection from the\nBMU. Whilst the charge/discharge rate of the battery may be controlled in a fairly\nsimple manner through current regulation, the monitoring of the state of charge\nin a battery is more complex. The principal methods that may be used to sense\ncharge-state are cell voltage, cell temperature, or cell pressure. It should be noted that\nthe level of full charge noted by each of these methods results in a different level of\novercharging. Pressure and temperature sensing results in overcharging by 20 to 30%,\nwhereas voltage sensing may indicate 10 to 20% overcharge. A principal problem\nwith voltage sensing arises because of the voltage\u2013charge\u2013temperature characteris-\ntics that may cause significant errors in determining the state of charge of the battery.\nAgain taking the Artemis spacecraft as an example, the overall battery control unit\nhas a mass of 25.5 kg. In sunlight, the power required to operate this is 63.5 W and\nin eclipse, 282 W. The efficiency of the BDR is 89%, and the BCR is 91%.\n\n\u2022 Power control and distribution unit (PCDU ). This unit provides monitoring and\nprotection for the bus current. Protection is normally achieved either by current\nlimiting or by fusing, the latter generally requiring a redundant path to be switched\ninto operation, normally by command from ground-control.\n\n\u2022 Power conversion unit (PCU ). This unit supplies the individual voltage/current char-\nacteristics required for loads. The typical low voltage outputs (e.g. \u00b115 V and 5 V)\nwill be regulated using solid-state switches that are pulse-width modulated. This unit\nmust also be able to cope with transient protection for over- and under-voltage and\nin-rush current limiting when units are switched on or off.\n\n10.6 POWER BUDGET\n\nThe foregoing sections have outlined the principles of the technology behind a power\nsystem for use on a spacecraft system. In this section the methodology used to provide\nthe size of a power system is outlined.\n\n10.6.1 Mission specific design issues\n\nThe starting point for any power system is in the definition of spacecraft electrical loads.\nIn general these will not be constant throughout the mission, or even throughout a single\norbit. The initial analysis must therefore take into account the mission profile and hence the\npower demand. The three critical issues that need be considered are the orbit parameters,\nthe nature of the mission (communications, science, or other) and the mission duration.\n\n\n\nPOWER BUDGET 10.6 351\n\nThe orbit selection has a major influence upon the radiation environment experienced,\nand hence the degradation anticipated in any solar array-based solution. Further, the\norbit will define the duration of eclipse periods (see Section 5.3.2 of Chapter 5), which\ntogether with the number of eclipses anticipated, will define battery requirements and the\ndegradation that might be expected to occur during the mission. Clearly in deep-space\nmissions an investigation of the most appropriate technology for the primary power source\nwill be influenced by the orbit.\n\nThe nature of the mission will have significant impact on the type of loads expected.\nThus for a communications satellite, independently of the orbit specification, it can be\nanticipated that the primary payload will be required at all times. Further, the power\ndemand in eclipse may well exceed that in sunlight, owing to the need both to operate the\npayload and to meet the additional burden from active, or power augmented elements, in\nthe Thermal Control System (TCS). Navigation and broadcast satellites will have similar\nrequirements to these. In contrast, a remote sensing spacecraft during eclipse may well not\nrequire the whole payload to be operational, particularly if there are passive optical instru-\nments. For such satellites, there may be a very great range of power demands owing to the\nmission requirements, especially if there are active microwave instruments. These instru-\nments may operate for only limited portions of the orbit, perhaps when communication of\ndata to a ground station is available; this can provide a very high peak load for the power\nsystem. Scientific satellites may have very specific payload operational requirements, with\nadditional complexity being provided by the need to download scientific data only when\nthe vehicle is within sight of a ground station. Deep-space missions will inevitably face\nthe temperature extremes that may require additional power for environmental control if\nthe spacecraft either goes very close to or very far from the Sun.\n\nThe mission duration will provide a major influence on the degradation of the power\nsystem. The two most significant influences are\n\n1. The total radiation dose expected which may determine, for a satellite carrying a\nsolar array, the amount of shielding required, and hence influence the specific mass\nof the power system.\n\n2. The number of eclipse cycles, which will influence the system reliability and its\ndegradation. Solar cell failure through open-circuit losses will clearly increase with\nincreased number of thermal cycles, driven by the entry to and from eclipse. Battery\ndegradation will progress with number of eclipse cycles; indeed for any given tech-\nnology there is only a maximum number of charge/discharge cycles that a battery\ncan sustain before failure.\n\n10.6.2 Power budget evaluation\n\nThe format of a typical power budget is shown in Table 10.8. In this each of the subsystems\nare identified, with, in this example, power shown simply in terms of eclipse and sunlight\nloads and peak loads. It is notable that the power subsystem itself also places a load on\nthe spacecraft.\n\nThe method adopted for deriving suitable values to insert in this table is as follows:\nSuppose data is available for each subsystem. Initially such data will exclude the power\nsubsystem. For each subsystem, data must be provided for both the sunlit orbit phase,\n\n\n\n352 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\nTable 10.8 Typical structure of a power budget\n\nSubsystem Peak Sunlight Eclipse Intelsat Average GEO\npower power Psun power Peclipse VIIa (%) comms.satellite (%)\n\nAOCS 5.0 3.6\nPower 10.4 11.2\nThermal control 4.9 6.4\nComms. n/a n/a\nData handling 0.6 1.6\nPayload 79.1 77.2\nAverage total power 100 100\n\nhaving, say an average value of Psun and the eclipse phase having an average value\nof Peclipse. Since the satellite must be provided with power throughout the mission, this\nspecifies the EOL requirement.\n\nIn reality this approach is highly simplified, since there will be specific events that\nmay place a high transient load on the power system. One such event is the firing of a\npyrotechnic device followed by the actuation of some form of deployment mechanism. As\nan example, the firing of a pyrotechnic release, followed by the deployment of a boom on\nthe Ulysses spacecraft, provided a transient load of nearly two thirds of the total available\npower from the RTG at the BOL.\n\nIn the principal operational phase of a mission, generally not all the spacecraft equip-\nment will be operating at one time. As a result the potential power demand, identified by\nsumming all the spacecraft loads, will never be a realistic value for the peak demand load.\nIndeed in many cases it will be found that such a summation exceeds the total power\navailability from the power bus. One subsystem that has widely varying requirements\nduring a mission is the thermal system. This subsystem must meet both a hot and cold\ncase, which may require very different levels of heater input. Again taking the Ulysses\nmission as an example, the \u2018hot\u2019 case heater power (8.7 W) was only one third that of the\n\u2018cold\u2019 case heater load (24.7 W).\n\nFor telecommunications spacecraft operating in GEO there is a fairly well-defined\npower profile between subsystems. Increasingly, as noted in Chapter 6, electric propulsion\nis being used on such missions for station keeping control, which results in an increase\nin the power required for the propulsion subsystem. Power for propulsion in Table 10.8\nis included in the AOCS subsystem in the power profile. This is shown as a percentage\nfor each of the subsystems for recently launched GEO communications satellites. The\nspecific profile for Intelsat VIIa is also shown.\n\n10.6.3 Approximate power system sizing\n\nA simplified block diagram for the power system is shown in Figure 10.17, in which\nthe efficiencies of various components are also identified. Representative values for the\nefficiencies may be found in Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5.\n\nConsider a general case for sizing a power system. Assuming that the orbit period is ? ,\nwith the time spent in sunlight ?sun, and the time spent in eclipse ?eclipse, then the power\n\n\n\nPOWER BUDGET 10.6 353\n\nPrimary\npower source \n\nPArray (W/m\n2) \n\nPower management\nBCR :  hBCR\nBDR :  hBDR\nArray regulator : hAR\n\nBattery\n      charge/\n\n        discharge:\nhcharge  \n\nPower distribution: hd \n\nRegulated bus \n\nFigure 10.17 Definition of system efficiencies\n\nrequired from the array to meet the eclipse load is clearly given by Pcharge, where\n\nPcharge?sun = 1\n?\n\nPeclipse?eclipse (10.5)\n\nand ? is the product of the efficiency terms shown in Figure 10.17,\n\n? = ?BDR?BCR?AR\n\nThe total power required to be available from the array is thus approximately given by\n\nParray = Psun + Pcharge (10.6)\n\nIn the limit, if all the efficiencies are equal to unity, it is apparent from equations (10.5)\nand (10.6) that if the eclipse power demand is the same as that in sunlight then the array\npower is simply given by\n\nParray = Psun\n(\n\n?\n\n?sun\n\n)\n(10.7)\n\nThus for LEO orbits where the fraction of the orbit in eclipse is large, typically of the\norder of 30 min out of 90 min, the array needs to be oversized relative to the sunlight\nprovision by a factor ?/?sun of approximately 1.5. Hence, in this approximate scenario,\nthe array power in LEO is required to be 50% in excess of the bus load. This may be\ncontrasted with the GEO case where a maximum eclipse duration of ?70 min in the\n\n\n\n354 ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEMS\n\n24- hour orbit arises. In this case the \u2018oversizing\u2019 of the array amounts to only 5%. This\nfeature clearly has significant influence over the design of a solar array.\n\nIf the orbit period is ? (hours), the battery-stored energy will be given approximately\nby EB (W-hrs)\n\nEB = Peclipse(? ? ?sun)/(?chargeDOD) (10.8)\nwhere the DOD is the depth of discharge of the battery. The battery mass can be estimated\nby dividing the stored energy (W-hrs) by the energy density (W-hrs/kg) for the chosen\nbattery technology. For example, for Li-ion the energy density is approximately 120 to\n175 W-hrs/kg.\n\nIn any particular case, the individual loads that will be switched in and out need to be\nconsidered. We can then modify equation (10.5) to obtain the total energy required from\nthe array. This may be written in the form ?array where\n\n?array = Parray?sun = 1\n?sun\n\n(\nk?\n\ni=1\nPi ti\n\n)\n+ 1\n\n?ecl\n\n(\nn?\n\ni=k+1\nPi ti\n\n)\n(10.9)\n\nin which the Pi , i = 1, . . . , n , gives the typical power profile for payload and subsystem\noperation throughout the orbit. A typical profile may be as illustrated in Figure 10.18.\nThe battery charge requirement during sunlight is explicitly excluded from this profile,\nsince the eclipse profile (second term in equation 10.9) is equivalent to the battery charge\nenergy (see equation 10.5). For the purposes of a first estimate of the array size, the\nefficiency factors have typical values of ?sun ? 0.8, from array to loads, and ?ecl ? 0.6,\nfrom batteries to loads.\n\nIn terms of calculating the array size, allowance needs to be made for any pointing-\nangle offset of the array relative to the sun line. This results in the array area being given\nby Aarray where\n\nAarray = Parray/(S cos ???cell?packing(1 ? D)) (10.10)\n\nHere S is the solar flux (?1400 W/m2 in a near-Earth orbit); ?? is the array pointing error\nwith respect to the Sun, which will typically be of order 1?, but is highly dependent on\n\nPower (W)\n\nTime \n\nP1 \n\nP2 \n\nP3 \n\nPk \n\nPk + 1 \nPn \n\n tsun  teclipse \n\nt1 t2 t3 tk tk + 1 tn \n\nFigure 10.18 Approximate power profile for payload and subsystem operation\nthroughout the orbit\n\n\n\nREFERENCES 355\n\nthe mission; ?cell is the solar cell efficiency; ?packing is the cell packing efficiency that is\ntypically 0.90; D is the array degradation factor over the spacecraft lifetime, which may\nbe calculated in the manner described in Section 10.3.1.\n\nIn a specific design, the sizing of the array given by the equivalent of equation (10.7)\nwill be modified to include specific mission profiles for \u2018hot\u2019 and \u2018cold\u2019 cases. These\ndiffering cases arise during the year, as a result of variation in solar insolation, which will\ninfluence the array temperature (see Chapter 11); this variation occurs due to the influence\nof the angle between the orbit plane and the ecliptic. As a result, the final EOL array\nand battery capacity can be specified. To define the BOL characteristics, loss factors due\nto radiation damage, micrometeorite damage and battery hysteresis losses must included.\nThus this process evidently requires the array and battery capacity to be oversized initially\nto meet the EOL power demands. Typically these loss factors may rise to 25% of the\ninitial provision, although this figure is highly dependent upon both mission duration and\nthe type of orbit, with Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEOs) being particularly affected by\nradiation damage.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] SPS Concept Development and Evaluation Programme Reference System Report (1978) US\nDOE and NASA DOE/ER 0023.\n\n[2] Landis, G.

Savage\n\nEuropean Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), European Space\nAgency\n\n11.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nSpacecraft thermal control\u2014that is the control of spacecraft equipment and structural\ntemperatures\u2014is required for two main reasons: (1) electronic and mechanical equip-\nment usually operate efficiently and reliably only within relatively narrow temperature\nranges and (2) most materials have non-zero coefficients of thermal expansion and hence\ntemperature changes imply thermal distortion.\n\nSpacecraft equipment is designed to operate most effectively at or around room tempera-\nture. The main reason for this is that most of the components used in spacecraft equipment,\nwhether electronic or mechanical, were originally designed for terrestrial use. It is also\nmuch easier and cheaper to perform equipment development and, eventually, qualification\nand flight acceptance testing at room temperature. Typically, operating electronic equip-\nment requires to be maintained in a temperature range between about ?15?C and +50?C,\nrechargeable batteries between about 0?C and +20?C and mechanisms (solar array drives,\nmomentum wheels, gyroscopes etc.) between about 0?C and +50?C. There are, of course,\nexceptions to this\u2014for example, some detectors within astronomical telescopes that need\nto be cooled to very low temperatures.\n\nMany spacecraft payloads require very high structural stability, and therefore thermally\ninduced distortion must be minimized or strictly controlled. For example, the search for\never-higher resolution from space-based telescopes means that temperatures stable to\nwithin a fraction of a Kelvin are often required within telescope systems several metres\nin size.\n\nHeat is generated both within the spacecraft and by the environment. Components pro-\nducing heat include rocket motors, electronic devices and batteries. Initial ascent heating\neffects are minimized by the launch vehicle\u2019s nose fairing. Heat from the space environ-\nment is largely the result of solar radiation. Heat is lost from the spacecraft by radiation.\nThe balance between heat gained and lost will determine the spacecraft temperatures.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n358 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nThe configuration of a spacecraft is dictated by many factors and \u2018thermal control\u2019 is\nonly one of them. The task for the thermal control engineer consists, in fact, of three\nmain parts. Firstly, analysis \u2014they must be able to analyse a given spacecraft configu-\nration and predict equipment and structural temperatures for all phases of the mission.\nSecondly, design \u2014in the rather likely circumstance that the results of the analysis show\ntemperatures falling outside allowed limits, the engineer must devise suitable solutions,\nfor example, by modifying heat-flow paths or implementing heaters, radiators and so on.\nFinally, testing \u2014the engineer must perform sufficient and appropriate testing to confirm\nthe accuracy of the analysis and of the thermal predictions for the mission.\n\nModern spacecraft, particularly those exploring the Solar System or involving human\ncrews, will often be composed of hardware supplied by different organizations, often from\ndifferent parts of the world. Customers and those responsible for the various stages of\nspacecraft integration will usually require such hardware to be developed according to\nrecognized standard practices and procedures. For Europe, the controlling authority for\nsuch standardization is the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS ). The\nrequirements for the specific discipline of spacecraft thermal engineering are covered in\nECSS-E-ST-31C [1].\n\n11.2 THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nAn important characteristic of the space environment is its high vacuum. Spacecraft are\ngenerally launched into orbits where the residual atmospheric pressure, and hence drag, is\nvery small (although often not negligible\u2014the International Space Station (ISS) requires\nregular re-boosting to compensate for air drag). Fortunately for the thermal control engi-\nneer, the very low level of drag implies also the absence of any significant aerodynamic\nheating . For an orbiting spacecraft, aerodynamic heating and indeed any convective inter-\naction between spacecraft and environment can be ignored.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s atmospheric pressure falls approximately exponentially with altitude, drop-\nping more than six orders of magnitude in the first 100 km above sea level [2]. Spacecraft\nin orbit around the Earth usually orbit at altitudes higher than 300 km where the residual\natmospheric pressure is typically less than 10?7 mb. During the launch phase, the transi-\ntion from being fully protected within the launch vehicle to autonomous operation in space\nis the result of a compromise. The sooner the nose fairings can be jettisoned, the more\npayload a given vehicle can launch. However, if they are jettisoned too early, dynamic\npressure and aerodynamic heating will damage the spacecraft. Fairings are normally jet-\ntisoned at the point where residual aerodynamic heating is the same as or less than the\nincident solar heating. This occurs at around 100 km altitude, depending on the charac-\nteristics of the launch vehicle and trajectory. Hence, once again, aerodynamic heating\neffects can be ignored by the spacecraft thermal designer. During re-entry or aerobraking\nmanoeuvres (see Chapter 5), specific protection is provided, which ensures that these\nphases do not drive the spacecraft thermal design.\n\nA spacecraft in space can interact with its environment only by radiation and this\ninteraction is characterized by the exchange of energy by means of the following (see\nFigure 11.1):\n\n\u2022 direct solar radiation;\n\u2022 solar radiation reflected from nearby planets (albedo radiation);\n\n\n\nTHE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT 11.2 359\n\n\u2022 thermal energy radiated from nearby planets (planetary radiation);\n\u2022 radiation from the spacecraft to deep space.\n\nThe spacecraft will experience thermal equilibrium when the sum of the radiant energy\nreceived from the first three sources listed above, together with any thermal dissipation\nwithin the spacecraft, is equal to the energy radiated to deep space. It is this balance that\nwill determine the physical temperature of the spacecraft.\n\n11.2.1 Solar radiation\n\nThe solar radiation parameters of interest to the thermal design engineer are (1) spectral\ndistribution, (2) intensity and (3) degree of collimation. The spectral distribution can\nbe considered constant throughout the solar system and the solar irradiance, or spectral\nenergy distribution, resembles a Plank curve with an effective temperature of 5800 K\n(see Chapter 2). This means that the bulk of the solar energy (99%) lies between\n150 nm and 10 ?m wavelength, with a maximum near 450 nm (in the yellow part of the\nvisible spectrum).\n\nThe solar radiation intensity outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and at the Earth\u2019s average\ndistance from the Sun (1 AU) is called the solar constant and is about 1371 \u00b1 5 W/m2.\nThe solar radiation intensity Js at any other distance d from the Sun can be found from\nthe simple relationship\n\nJs = P\n4?d2\n\n(11.1)\n\nwhere P is the total power output from the Sun, 3.856 \u00d7 1026 W. Table 11.1 shows the\nresulting variation in solar intensity that can be expected at the average distance from the\nSun of each of the planets in the solar system.\n\nSolar radiation\n\nSun Direct radiation to space \n\nAlbedo radiation\n\nPlanetary radiation\nPlanet\n\nFigure 11.1 Typical spacecraft thermal environment\n\n\n\n360 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nTable 11.1 Planetary solar constants and albedo values [3, 4]\n\nPlanet Solar radiation intensity, Js Planetary albedo, a\n(percentage of solar intensity at 1 AU)\n\nMercury 667 0.06\u20130.10\nVenus 191 0.60\u20130.76\nEarth 100 0.31\u20130.39\nMoon 100 0.07\nMars 43.1 0.15\nJupiter 3.69 0.41\u20130.52\nSaturn 1.10 0.42\u20130.76\nUranus 0.27 0.45\u20130.66\nNeptune 0.11 0.35\u20130.62\nPluto 0.064 0.16\u20130.40\n\nThe angle subtended by the Sun in the vicinity of the Earth (at 1 AU from the Sun) is\nabout 0.5?. This means that the sunlight incident on a spacecraft can, for thermal control\npurposes, be regarded as a parallel beam emanating from a point source. This is not true,\nhowever, for spacecraft whose mission takes them very close to the Sun.\n\nThe fraction of the solar radiation that is reflected from the surface and/or atmosphere\nof a planet is known as the planetary albedo. Its value is highly dependent on local\nsurface and atmospheric properties. For example, for the Earth, it varies from as high as\n0.8 from clouds to as low as 0.05 over surface features such as water and forest [3, 4].\nFortunately for the thermal engineer, such changes occur rapidly in relation to the thermal\ninertia of most spacecraft, and an orbital average value, a , can be used for thermal design\npurposes. For the Earth, this is in the range 0.31\u20130.39. Table 11.1 lists the albedo values\nfor the planets of the solar system. The reader should be aware that measuring the albedo\nof the more distant planets is not an easy task and that the quoted figures should be\ntreated with caution. Although the spectral distribution of albedo radiation is not identical\nto that of the Sun, as is evidenced by the diverse colours of planetary surface features,\nthe differences are insignificant for thermal engineering purposes and can be ignored.\n\nThe intensity of the albedo radiation, Ja , incident on a spacecraft is a complex function\nof planet size and reflective characteristics, spacecraft altitude and the angle ? between\nthe local vertical and the Sun\u2019s rays. This can be expressed in terms of a visibility factor\nF as follows\n\nJa = JsaF (11.2)\n\nFor the purpose of calculating albedo radiation inputs, the Earth can be regarded as\na diffuse reflecting sphere, in which case the visibility factor varies approximately as\nshown in Figure 11.2.\n\nIt is emphasized that the above treatment is approximate. For complex spacecraft,\nparticularly in low orbits, accurate calculation of albedo inputs may need to be performed\nas a function of orbital position for each external surface element. These are complicated\ncalculations for which specific software tools are available.\n\n\n\nTHE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT 11.2 361\n\n105\n\n10?4\n\n104\n\n103\n\n102\n10?3 10?2 10?1 100 101\n\nVisibility factor F\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n160\u00b0\n\n150\u00b0\n\n140\u00b0\n\n130\u00b0\n\n120\u00b0\n\n110\u00b0\n\n100\u00b0\n90\u00b0 80\u00b0 70\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0\n30\u00b0\n0\u00b0 = b\n\nFigure 11.2 Spacecraft albedo irradiation. ? is the angle between the local vertical and\nthe Sun\u2019s rays\n\n11.2.2 Planetary radiation\n\nSince the planets of the Solar System all have non-zero temperatures, they all radiate heat.\nBecause of its relatively low temperature, the Earth radiates all of its heat at infrared wave-\nlengths, effectively between about 2 and 50 ?m with peak intensity around 10 ?m. For this\nreason, the radiation is often referred to as thermal radiation . The spectral distribution\nof the Earth\u2019s thermal radiation is shown in Figure 11.3 [3]. The atmosphere is essen-\ntially opaque over much of the infrared spectrum, with important transparent windows at\naround 8\u201313 ?m. The radiation that a spacecraft sees is hence composed of radiation from\nthe upper atmosphere, radiating with an effective black-body temperature of 218 K, with,\nsuperimposed upon it, radiation passing through the infrared windows from the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. Since terrestrial temperatures vary with time and geographical location, the inten-\nsity Jp of the thermal radiation incident on orbiting spacecraft can also be expected to\nvary with time and position around the orbit. In fact, due to the Earth\u2019s large thermal\ninertia with respect to diurnal and seasonal changes and the spacecraft\u2019s large thermal\ninertia with respect to its orbital period, only very small errors occur if averaged values\nare used. For most practical purposes, the thermal engineer can assume that the Earth\nradiates with an intensity of 237 W/m2 and that the thermal radiation emanates uniformly\nfrom the whole cross-sectional area of the Earth.\n\nSince the intensity falls with altitude according to the inverse-square law, the approxi-\nmate value of Jp in W/m2 at a given altitude can be found from\n\nJp = 237\n(\n\nRrad\nRorbit\n\n)2\n\n\n\n362 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\n288 K black body\n\n218 K black body\n\nApproximate radiation\nfrom earth atmosphere\n\nS\npe\n\nct\nra\n\nl e\nm\n\nis\nsi\n\nve\n p\n\now\ner\n\n (\n10\n\n?3\n W\n\n/c\nm\n\n2  \n?m\n\n)\n\nWave length (?m)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0 10 20 30\n\nFigure 11.3 Typical spectral emissive power for the thermal radiation from Earth.\n(Note: The 288 K black-body curve approximates the radiation from the Earth\u2019s surface,\nand the 218 K black-body curve approximates the radiation from the atmosphere in\nthose spectral regions where the atmosphere is opaque)\n\nwhere Rrad is the radius of the Earth\u2019s effective radiating surface and Rorbit is the orbit\nradius. The precise value of Rrad is not easy to determine and for most practical purposes\nit can be assumed equal to the radius of the Earth\u2019s surface, RE . For other planets, care\nneeds to be taken to verify the validity of these assumptions on a case-by-case basis.\nFor example, Mercury, with a sidereal day of the same order of magnitude as its year\n(59 and 88 Earth-days, respectively), sustains temperature differences of hundreds of\ndegrees between sunlit and shadowed sides, with a slow-moving terminator. Its orbit is\nalso sufficiently eccentric for its solar constant to more than double between apohelion\nand perihelion, giving rise to large seasonal variations.\n\n11.2.3 Spacecraft heat emission\n\nThe spacecraft itself has a finite temperature, so it will also radiate heat to space. Since the\nspacecraft temperature will be similar to that of the Earth (if the thermal engineers have\ndone their job properly), it too will radiate all its heat in the infrared region of the spectrum.\n\n11.3 THERMAL BALANCE\n\nAs already noted, the temperature of a spacecraft depends on the balance between the\nheat received from external and internal sources, and the heat radiated to space. In order\n\n\n\nTHERMAL BALANCE 11.3 363\n\nto control spacecraft temperatures, it is necessary to control the heat absorbed, the heat\nradiated or (usually) both.\n\nIf spacecraft were black bodies , that is, radiated as black bodies and absorbed all the\nradiation that fell on them, they would acquire a certain temperature and that would be\nthe end of the story. Thermal control would be impossible, except perhaps by varying\nthe internal heat dissipation. However, spacecraft are not black bodies but absorb only a\nfraction ? of incident energy. They also emit as a grey body , radiating a fraction ? of the\nradiation of a black body at the same temperature. This may be expressed as\n\nJabsorbed = ?Jincident (11.3)\nJradiated = ??T 4 (11.4)\n\nwhere ? and ? are known as the absorptance and the emittance, respectively, and ? is\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann constant equal to 5.67 \u00d7 10?8 W m?2 K?4.\n\nFor a spacecraft with no internal heat dissipation, an effective absorbing area (projected\narea facing the Sun) A? , and emitting area A?, thermal equilibrium is achieved when\n\nA?Jabsorbed = A?Jradiated (11.5)\n\nwhich from equations (11.3) and (11.4) gives\n\nA??Jincident = A???T 4\n\nso that the equilibrium temperature T is given by\n\nT 4 = A?\nA?\n\nJincident\n?\n\n(?\n?\n\n)\n(11.6)\n\nSince A? , A? and ? are constants, and for a given value of Jincident, the value of T can\nbe controlled by varying the value of ?/?.\n\nIn fact, things are not quite as simple as that, as ? and ? are not independent vari-\nables. Over any given wavelength range, the laws of thermodynamics require that ? = ?\n(Kirchoff\u2019s law). Thus for any surface, its absorbtivity at a given wavelength is equal to\nits emissivity at the same wavelength.\n\nFortunately for the thermal control engineer, absorptivity and emissivity generally vary\nwith wavelength and we have already learnt that the radiation environment of a spacecraft\nis basically composed of radiation either at \u2018visible\u2019 wavelengths or in the infrared. It is\nthis feature that makes spacecraft thermal control possible. For the spacecraft thermal\ncontrol engineer:\n\n? means the absorptance of a surface illuminated by solar radiation (peak intensity at\nabout 0.45 ?m)\u2014it is therefore often referred to as the \u2018solar absorptance\u2019.\n\n? means the emittance of a surface radiating in the infrared region (peak intensity at\nabout 10 ?m)\u2014it is therefore often referred to as the \u2018infrared emittance\u2019.\n\nNote that, according to Kirchoff\u2019s law, the absorptance of a spacecraft to planetary\nradiation is equal to its infrared emittance, ?.\n\n\n\n364 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nBy way of an example, let us consider a simple spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\nFor the sake of convenience, let us assume a polar orbit that does not suffer from eclipses\n(a so-called dawn-dusk orbit\u2014see Chapter 5) and let us furthermore assume that our\nspacecraft has a high thermal inertia and is isothermal. We have\n\nheat received directly from the Sun = Js?Asolar\nalbedo contribution = Ja?Aalbedo\nplanetary radiation contribution = Jp?Aplanetary\nheat radiated to space = ?T 4?Asurface\ninternally dissipated power = Q\n\nwhere Asolar, Aalbedo and Aplanetary are the projected areas receiving, respectively, solar,\nalbedo and planetary radiation, and Asurface is the spacecraft total surface area. If we\nassume that Js , Ja , Jp and Q remain constant, our spacecraft will acquire an equilibrium\ntemperature T given by\n\n(AsolarJs + AalbedoJa)? + AplanetaryJp? + Q = Asurface?T 4?.\nHence\n\nT 4 = AplanetaryJp\nAsurface?\n\n+ Q\nAsurface??\n\n+ (AsolarJs + AalbedoJa)\nAsurface?\n\n(?\n?\n\n)\n(11.7)\n\nSo once again we see that the spacecraft temperature is dependent on the ratio ?/?,\nparticularly for spacecraft for which Q is small. For simplicity, let us assume a spherical\nspacecraft, radius r, for which\n\nAsurface = 4?r2, Asolar = Aalbedo = Aplanetary = ?r2, Q = 0\nJa = 0.33FJs (Earth albedo a = 0.33),\nJp = 220 W/m2(corresponding to an orbit altitude of around 240 km).\n\nThen equation (11.7) reduces to\n\nT 4 = 9.70 \u00d7 108 + 4.41 \u00d7 106(1 + 0.33F )Js\n(?\n\n?\n\n)\n\nFor Js = 1371 W/m2, F = 0.15 (from Figure 11.2) and a black paint finish for which\n?/? = 1, our spacecraft equilibrium temperature is about 293 K or 20?C.\n\nIf we now turn the orbit plane until the spacecraft passes through the Earth\u2019s shadow,\nthe heat absorbed from the Sun (directly and as albedo) will be reduced. Assuming a\nsufficiently high thermal inertia, a new equilibrium temperature will be obtained. Let\nus consider the case in which the Earth-Sun vector lies in the plane of the orbit. This\nwill evidently give the minimum time in sunlight, which, for a LEO spacecraft at an\naltitude of 240 km, is about 59% of its orbit period. Under these conditions, an average\nalbedo visibility factor can be estimated from Figure 11.2 for the illuminated part of the\norbit, F ? 0.7. Note that the albedo radiation is zero during eclipse.

They\nare certainly not isothermal and often contain components (e.g. the solar arrays) with a\nrelatively low thermal inertia, which will change temperature significantly around an orbit\n(particularly when entering or leaving an eclipse).

Calculation of the internal thermal balance, involving\nradiative and conductive exchanges between all the spacecraft components, is complex\nand is covered in some detail in the next section.\n\n11.4 THERMAL ANALYSIS\n\n11.4.1 Thermal mathematical model (TMM)\n\nSpacecraft are generally very complex structures within which temperatures are varying\ncontinuously as a function of location and time. Calculating these temperature fields in rig-\norous detail is, for all practical purposes, impossible. In order to progress further, it is first\nnecessary to simplify the problem. This is done by generating an approximate represen-\ntation of the spacecraft that is amenable to mathematical treatment. Such a representation\nis known as a thermal mathematical model (TMM).\n\nIn order to construct a TMM, the spacecraft is considered as being composed of a\nnumber of discrete regions within which temperature gradients can be neglected. These\nregions are known as isothermal nodes . Each node is characterized by a temperature,\nthermal capacity, heat dissipation (if any) and radiative and conductive interfaces with the\nsurrounding nodes. Nodes that can \u2018see\u2019 space directly will also have radiative interfaces\nwith the external environment.\n\n11.4.2 Conductive heat exchange\n\nThe conductive heat flow rate, Qc, is given by\n\nQc = ?A\nl\n\n?T (11.8)\n\nwhere ? is the thermal conductivity, A the cross-sectional area, l the conductive path length\nand ?T the temperature difference. The term ?A/l is known as the thermal conductance,\nhc, and hence the temperature difference can be written as\n\n?T = Qc 1\nhc\n\n(11.9)\n\nIn most engineering applications, A and possibly ? may vary significantly along the path\nlength. If the conductive path is considered as a number of discrete conductive paths\nconnected in series, the temperature difference can be rewritten as\n\n?T = Qc\n(\n\n1\n\nh1\n+ 1\n\nh2\n+ 1\n\nh3\n+ . . . .\n\n)\n= Qc 1\n\nhc\n\nand hence the effective thermal conductance, hc , for the path can be found from\n\n1\n\nhc\n= 1\n\nh1\n+ 1\n\nh2\n+ 1\n\nh3\n+ . . . . (11.10)\n\n\n\nTHERMAL ANALYSIS 11.4 367\n\nFor a spacecraft composed of n isothermal nodes, the heat conducted from the i th to the\nj th node is given by\n\nQcij = hij (Ti ? Tj ) (11.11)\n\nwhere hij is the effective conductance between nodes i and j and Ti and Tj are the\ntemperatures of the i th and j th nodes, respectively.\n\n11.4.3 Radiative heat exchange\n\nRadiative heat exchange between two surfaces is determined by three important\nparameters\u2014the surface temperatures, the radiative view factors and the surface\nproperties. For diffuse surfaces, the amount of radiation leaving a surface i and absorbed\nby a surface j can be shown [7] to be of the form\n\nQrij = Ai Fij ?ij ?(T 4i ? T 4j ) (11.12)\n\nwhere Ai is the area of the surface i , Fij is the view factor of surface j as seen from\nsurface i and ?ij is a parameter known as the effective emittance. Note that it is assumed\nin the above that the value of the view factor Fij remains constant over the surface i .\n\nView factors\n\nThe radiative view factor Fij is defined as the fraction of the radiation leaving one surface\nthat is intercepted by another. It follows that from any node i inside a spacecraft, the sum\nof the view factors to surrounding equipment must be unity,\n\nk?\nj=1\n\nFij = 1 (11.13)\n\nwhere k is the number of surrounding surfaces.\nConsider two surfaces A1 and A2 as indicated in Figure 11.4 and let us assume that\n\nthey are both diffuse surfaces. The radiation emitted from A1 in the direction of A2, per\nunit solid angle and per unit area of A1, is given by\n\nI1 = I0 cos ?1 (11.14)\n\nwhere I0 is the radiation intensity normal to A1.\nFor the elementary surfaces ?A1 and ?A2, the total radiation leaving ?A1 and falling on\n\n?A2 is given by\n\n?Qr12 = I0?A1 cos ?1\n?A2 cos ?2\n\ns2\n\nHence, the total radiation reaching A2 from A1 is given by\n\nQr12 = I0\n?\nA1\n\n?\nA2\n\ncos ?1 cos ?2\ns2\n\ndA1dA2\n\n\n\n368 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nA1\n\nA2\n\ns\nf1\n\nf2\n\nFigure 11.4 View factor geometry between surfaces A1 and A2\n\nHowever, from equation (11.14) it can be easily shown that the total radiation leaving A1\nis given by\n\nQrtot = A1I0\n?/2?\n\n0\n\n2? sin ? cos ? d? = A1?I0\n\nThe view factor, F12, is then\n\nF12 = Qr12\nQrtot\n\n= 1\nA1\n\n?\nA1\n\n?\nA2\n\ncos ?1 cos ?2\n?s2\n\ndA1dA2 (11.15)\n\nwhich can be rewritten more generally in the form\n\nAi Fij =\n?\nAi\n\n?\nAj\n\ncos ?i cos ?j\n?s2\n\ndAi dAj (11.16)\n\nFrom an examination of the symmetry of this equation, an important reciprocity relation-\nship can be deduced\n\nAi Fij = Aj Fji (11.17)\n\nThe calculation of view factors is a tedious process and many examples of standard\nconfigurations are available in the literature [6] to make the task easier. For simple space-\ncraft designs, view factors can also be obtained experimentally, for example, by observing\nshadows cast by scale models [8] or using a device known as a factometer [9]. Although\nthese techniques still have a place in the thermal engineer\u2019s arsenal, sophisticated soft-\nware tools, such as ESARAD [10, 11], capable of handling large and complex spacecraft\nconfigurations, have largely superseded them.\n\n\n\nTHERMAL ANALYSIS 11.4 369\n\nEffective emittance\n\nThe effective emittance between two surfaces has a complicated dependence on surface\noptical properties, mutual reflections and reflections via other nearby surfaces. Its detailed\ntreatment is beyond the scope of this book but can be found in Reference [7]. In the simple\ncase in which all surfaces are perfectly black (i.e. ? = 1 for all surfaces, not just surfaces\ni and j ), the effective emittance reduces to the trivial result ?ij = 1. Specular surfaces\nand/or emittance values less than unity give rise to more complicated expressions for ?ij .\nFor the relatively simple case of two parallel, diffuse surfaces, separated by a distance\nthat is small compared with their surface areas, it can be shown that\n\n?ij = ?i?j\n?i + ?j ? ?i?j (11.18)\n\nIn spite of the fact that this is a special case, seldom encountered in practice, errors\nintroduced by its use are small, provided the surfaces involved are diffuse and have\nrelatively high ? values. This expression is commonly used for the calculation of practical\neffective emittance values and is acceptable for normal purposes in which the spacecraft\ninterior is painted (?i = ?j ? 0.9, ? ?ij ? 0.82). The use of specular and/or low-emittance\nsurfaces will involve complicated analysis, which will need to be repeated for every\nchange in the spacecraft internal configuration, and this should be avoided where possible.\n\n11.4.4 Calculation of nodal temperatures\n\nLet us consider, at a particular time, the heat balance of the i th node of a TMM consisting\nof n nodes. The net heat absorbed by node i per unit time is given by\n\nQexternal,i + Qi ? ??i Aspace,i T 4i ?\nn?\n\nj=1\nhij (Ti ? Tj ) ? ?\n\nn?\nj=1\n\nAi Fij ?ij (T\n4\ni ? T 4j )\n\nwhere\nQexternal,i = Js?i Asolar,i + Ja?i Aalbedo,i + Jp?i Aplanetary,i\n\nis the external heat input. Asolar,i , Aalbedo,i and Aplanetary,i are the effective areas receiving,\nrespectively, direct solar, albedo and planetary radiation, Aspace,i is the effective area with\nan unobstructed view of space and Qi is the internal heat dissipation. If the mass and\nspecific heat of the node are mi and Ci , respectively, the heat balance equation for node\ni can be written as\n\nmi Ci\ndTi\ndt\n\n= Qexternal,i + Qi ? ??i Aspace,i T 4i ?\nn?\n\nj=1\nhij (Ti ? Tj )\n\n??\nn?\n\nj=1\nAi Fij ?ij (T\n\n4\ni ? T 4j ) (11.19)\n\n\n\n370 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nThe thermal behaviour of the complete spacecraft is thus described by the set of n\nsimultaneous non-linear differential equations as above, with i varying from 1 to n .\nIt should be noted that, in most practical cases, Qexternal,i and Qi will also vary with time.\n\nGenerally speaking, the above set of equations is not amenable to analytical solution,\nand numerical methods must be used. A common approach relies on first linearizing the\nequations as follows.\n\nIf Ti ,0 is the temperature of the i th node at some arbitrary time, t0, the temperature of\nthat node a short while, ?t , later is given by\n\nTi = Ti ,0 + ?Ti ,0 where ?Ti ,0 = dTi ,0\ndt\n\n?t\n\nFrom the first of these equations and assuming that ?Ti ,0 is small compared with Ti ,0 we\nsee that\n\nT 4i = (Ti ,0 + ?Ti ,0)4 ? T 4i ,0 + 4T 3i ,0?Ti ,0\n\nand hence that\n\nT 4i ? Ti (4T 3i ,0) ? 3T 4i ,0 (11.20)\n\nSteady-state calculations\n\nIn the special case of steady-state calculations, where Qexternal,i and Qi are constant and\ndT/dt is zero, use of equation (11.20) allows us to write equation (11.19) in the linearized\nform as follows:\n\nTi\n\n[\nn?\n\nj=1\nhij + 4?T 3i ,0\n\n(\nAspace,i ?i +\n\nn?\nj=1\n\nAi Fij ?ij\n\n)]\n?\n\nn?\nj=1\n\nTj [hij + 4?T 3j ,0Ai Fij ?ij ]\n\n= Qexternal,i + Qi + 3?T 4i ,0 Aspace,i?i + 3?(T 4i ,0 ? T 4j ,0)\nn?\n\nj=1\nAi Fij ?ij\n\n(11.21)\n\nThis is a set of linear equations in n unknowns Ti , where i = 1 to n , and can be solved by\nstandard matrix inversion techniques. The calculated temperatures can then be substituted\nfor the original values of Ti ,0 and the calculation repeated until the difference between\nnewly calculated and previously calculated temperatures is sufficiently small for steady-\nstate conditions to be assumed, that is, dTi /dt is sensibly zero. It should be noted that,\nalthough the criterion that ?Ti ,0 should be small may not be met initially, it will be so for\nthe final iterations and hence the final calculated temperatures will be correct.\n\nTransient calculations\n\nA similar approach can be used to analyse non-steady-state conditions. However, the\nleft-hand-side of equation (11.19) must be replaced by the term\n\nmi Ci\n(Ti ? Ti ,0)\n\n?t\n\n\n\nTHERMAL DESIGN 11.5 371\n\nand the temperatures and heat inputs by their average values over the time interval\n?t , given by (Ti ,0 + Ti )/2, (Tj ,0 + Tj )/2, (Qexternal,i ,0 + Qexternal,i )/2 and (Qi ,0 + Qi )/2,\nrespectively.\n\nReplacing the values of Ti ,0 by the newly calculated values Ti and repeating the calcu-\nlation will provide the temperature history at successive intervals of time ?t . It should be\nnoted that, for this to be accurate, ?Ti ,0 must be small since, at a given time, the tempera-\ntures are the result of a single calculation and not the result of multiple iterations as in the\ncase of the steady-state calculation. In practical terms, this means that ?t should not be too\nlarge and that the initial temperature values Ti ,0 should be as realistic as possible. In the\nlatter context, the temperature distribution resulting from a steady-state calculation using\norbital-average heat inputs is often used as the starting point for a transient calculation.\n\nMany software codes have been developed over the years to perform the above\ncalculations. The one most commonly used in Europe is the ESA-sponsored ESATAN\npackage [12, 13]. For small TMMs, a spreadsheet-based programme is also available,\nTHERMXL [14].\n\n11.5 THERMAL DESIGN\n\n11.5.1 Requirements and constraints\n\nThe first task is to examine the proposed spacecraft concept and assemble the thermal\nparameters for the on-board equipment. The equipment designer should provide upper and\nlower safe operating temperatures for his equipment and should also specify the oper-\nating power dissipation or dissipation ranges. Detailed drawings and materials lists will\nbe required in order to calculate nodal thermal capacitances, conductance paths and view\nfactors. Orbital and other operating constraints must also be defined. For example, an\nEarth observation spacecraft may well need to be in a near-polar orbit with the plane of\nthe orbit set at a specified angle to the solar vector in order to emphasize ground features\n(shadow effects). There may also be constraints on allowable attitudes. For example, an\nEarth observation spacecraft must turn so that its instruments always face the Earth, a solar\nobservatory will be oriented such that its instruments always face the Sun and an astro-\nnomical spacecraft must ensure that its telescopes never come too close to the solar vector.\n\nAs an example, let us look again at our spherical spacecraft. For simplicity, let us assume\nthat its mission is to enable upper atmospheric density to be inferred from measurements\nof the orbit decay over a period of a few weeks. The example chosen is relevant, and yet\nsimple enough to show thermal design methodology in action. The principal investigator\nrequires the external geometry to be a clean spherical surface that is as inert as possible\nto try to minimize any possible chemical effects (the spacecraft will be flying through\na residual atmosphere which is nearly 100% atomic oxygen\u2014see Chapter 2). The ideal\nwould be a gold-plated sphere with a diameter of 1 m. Launch site and launch vehicle\nconstraints require that the spacecraft be spinning and that it will be in a polar orbit, but\nthe angle between the orbit and solar vector is unknown. The angle between the spin axis\nand solar vector is also unknown and not controllable. The spacecraft systems engineers\ndetermine that the spacecraft will be tracked via a battery-powered beacon, located at\nthe centre of the sphere, which dissipates 5 W. This is mounted through a circular panel\nacross the spacecraft\u2019s \u2018equator\u2019 and supported by two tubes along the spin axis, as shown\n\n\n\n372 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\n8\n\n10\n\nSpin axis\nExternal white\n\npaint\n\nBattery-beacon\npackage\n\nGold plated\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n9\n\nFigure 11.5 Spacecraft configuration and nodal breakdown\n\nschematically in Figure 11.5. The two hemispheres on each side of the equatorial panel\nact as the beacon\u2019s antenna. The battery supplier confirms that, for the short lifetime of\nthe spacecraft, the batteries can tolerate temperatures between ?15?C and +60?C. We\nhave already seen that the thermal analysis process involves approximations, particularly\nconcerning the establishment of the TMM. We should, therefore, take an appropriate\nmargin here, and design to stay within the range ?5?C\u2014+50?C.\n\n11.5.2 Definition of worst-case conditions\n\nThe task of the thermal designer is not usually to achieve a specific temperature but\nrather to ensure that equipment stays within certain acceptable limits. To do this, worst-\ncase conditions should be defined. These would typically be the orbits with maximum\nand minimum periods of sunlight, combined with certain extreme spacecraft attitudes\nand operational modes. In most cases, these worst-case conditions are established by\ninspection and experience. In the case of our air density spacecraft, we must design for\nboth full-sun (hot case) and 59% sun (cold case) orbits, and for any attitude with respect\nto the solar vector.\n\nFrom an inspection of Table 11.2, it is clear that our principal investigator will have\nto accept some compromise concerning the external surface of the sphere. A gold plated\nsphere will have an average temperature between 138?C and 176?C, neglecting the internal\nheat dissipation. It is evidently necessary to apply a low-?/? surface coating, say a white\npaint, to part of the external surface. However, this should be the minimum area consistent\nwith keeping the battery-beacon package below 50?C. A paint pattern consisting of several\n\n\n\nTHERMAL DESIGN 11.5 373\n\nsegments (see Figure 11.5) is relatively easy to apply and gives the necessary degree of\nsurface uniformity.\n\n11.5.3 The TMM\n\nFigure 11.5 shows a simple nodal breakdown for the air density-measuring spacecraft. It\nconsists essentially of a gold-plated aluminium sphere with a honeycomb panel across its\nequator, which supports the battery-beacon package at its centre. Two aluminium tubes\nare used to provide additional support along the spacecraft spin axis. Since the spacecraft\nis spinning and the only source of internal dissipation is at the centre, we may assume\nthat temperatures vary only with spacecraft \u2018latitude\u2019. Each hemisphere can therefore be\nmodelled as a number of isothermal nodes (zones) generated by planes parallel to the\nspacecraft equator. For our example, each hemisphere is divided into three such nodes\nas shown in Figure 11.5. The various conductance terms, view factors and nodal thermal\ncapacitances can now be calculated as indicated previously. Table 11.4 lists the resulting\nview-factor area products and conductance terms.\n\n11.5.4 Results and discussion\n\nFor the analysis, the incident heat flux densities were the same as those used for the\nexample worked in Section 11.3. That is,\n\nJs = 1371 W/m2, Jp = 220 W/m2,\nJa = 67.9 W/m2 [? 0.33(0.15)Js]\n\nfor the 100% sunlit orbit and 316.7 W/m2 [? 0.33 (0.7) Js] for the sunlit part of the\n\u2018cold\u2019 orbit.\n\nThe internal surfaces of the spacecraft were assumed painted with a matt white paint\nwith ? = 0.9, whence ?ij = 0.82. The paint pattern on the external surface consists of\nseveral (the number is not important) segments, each of which is defined by planes\n\nTable 11.4 View factors and conductance terms\n\n         j\n     i \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n1 0.068 0.079 0 0 0 0 0.013 0.215 0.058\n2 1.03 0.089 0 0 0 0 0.018 0.241 0.031\n3 0 2.10 0 0 0 0 0.016 0.246 0.018\n4 0 0 2.54 0.089 0.079 0.018 0.016 0.246 0\n5 0 0 0 2.10 0.068 0.031 0.018 0.241 0\n6 0 0 0 0 1.03 0.058 0.013 0.215 0\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0.18 0.0027 0.031 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.16 0.054 0.0027\n9 0 0 1.41 1.41 0 0 0 0.94 0.031\n10 0.18 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.16 0\n\nView-factor \u00d7 area products (m2)\n\nConductance terms (W/K) \n\n\n\n374 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\ncontaining the spin axis. This means that the percentage painted area of each node is the\nsame. For this example, a silicate-based white paint with ?/? = 0.16 has been used.\n\nTable 11.5 and Figures 11.6 and 11.7 show the results (obtained using the ThermXL [14]\nsoftware) for the case in which 15% of the external surface is covered with white paint,\ngiving an effective ?/? = 1.38 for the external surfaces of nodes 1 to 6.\n\nIt can be seen that the maximum predicted temperature of the battery-beacon package\n(Table 11.5) is comfortably inside the 50?C maximum. If required, the design can be\ntrimmed, for example, by modifying the external paint coverage, and the analysis re-run\nuntil the desired maximum predicted temperature has been attained.\n\n?10\n?5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000\n\nSphere_1+Z\nSphere_2\nSphere_3\n\nSphere_4\nSphere_5\n\nSphere_6?Z\nTube?Z\nBattery\n\nDisc\nTube+Z\n\nSeconds\n\n\u00b0C\n\nFigure 11.6 Temperature evolution, side-to-Sun, maximum eclipse\n\n?10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000\n\nSphere_1+Z\nSphere_2\nSphere_3\nSphere_4\nSphere_5\nSphere_6?Z\nTube?Z\nBattery\nDisc\nTube+Z\n\nSeconds\n\n\u00b0C\n\nFigure 11.7 Temperature evolution, top-to-Sun, maximum eclipse\n\n\n\nTHERMAL TECHNOLOGY 11.6 375\n\nTable 11.5 Calculated temperatures for 100% sunlit orbit\n\nNode Location Temperature (?C)\nNumber Side-to-Sun case Top-to-Sun case\n\n1 external surface 40.6 72.3\n2 external surface 44.6 57.2\n3 external surface 45.8 43.8\n4 external surface 45.8 32.1\n5 external surface 44.6 25.3\n6 external surface 40.6 22.1\n7 support tube 43.3 30.7\n8 battery-beacon 46.7 45.5\n9 Support platform 44.6 42.3\n\n10 support tube 43.3 59.2\n\nFor the cold cases (Figures 11.6 and 11.7), the battery-beacon package remains well\nabove the ?5?C lower allowed limit. We may therefore conclude that our thermal design\nis adequate for this spacecraft and its mission.\n\nMore complex spacecraft with more complex missions and more variable environments\nwill require more complicated thermal design. Reliance on thermal conduction, radiation\nexchange and insulation systems is known as passive thermal control and is the initial\nstarting point for most spacecraft thermal design. However, where this proves inadequate,\nactive thermal control techniques can be used. These are predominantly concerned with\nthe active control of internal dissipation, for example, by the use of heaters, and of\nradiative, conductive and forced convective heat flows as a function of temperature. These\nactive techniques are described in more detail in the next Section.\n\nIn the event that temperature requirements cannot be met, or can be met only at great\nexpense or with significant risk, it will be necessary to revisit the requirements. This may\ninvolve re-qualifying hardware for different temperature ranges, or changes in spacecraft\nsystem design or mission profile. Project managers will expect such feedback earlier rather\nthan later. Consequently, thermal design should start early with simplified TMMs, only\nmoving to more detailed models once the overall concept has been shown to be sound.\n\n11.6 THERMAL TECHNOLOGY\n\n11.6.1 Passive control\n\nPassive thermal control techniques available to the engineer consist essentially of the\nselection of surface properties, the control of conduction paths and thermal capacities and\nthe use of insulation systems.\n\nSurface finishes\n\nAlthough a wide range of ?/? values is, in principle, available (see Table 11.3), the\npractical selection of surface finishes is often restricted by their ageing characteristics.\n\n\n\n376 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nContamination of low-? surfaces (white paint, polished or electroplated metal surfaces)\nwill increase the ? value and should be avoided. Paints generally consist of a binder\nthat is transparent to visible light and a filler material that gives it its colour. Often the\nbinder will be opaque in the infrared, which implies that most paints have high ? values.\nUnfortunately, many binders degrade and discolour under the influence of solar ultraviolet\nradiation, becoming less transparent to visible light. White paint on the outside of a\nspacecraft will suffer an increase in its ?/? value with time and care must be taken to select\nthe most suitable formulation [5, 6]. The presence of contamination (grease, oil etc.) will\nexacerbate the situation. Reflectors such as Second Surface Mirrors (SSMs) (plastic film,\naluminized or silver coated on the back side) or Optical Solar Reflectors (OSRs) (similar\nto SSM but using thin sheets of glass instead of plastic film) are less sensitive to solar\nradiation and are easier to clean. Compared to paints, however, SSMs and OSRs are more\ndifficult to apply to spacecraft surfaces, particularly those with complicated geometry.\n\nSuitable allowance must be made for any likely changes in surface optical properties\nduring the design lifetime of the spacecraft.\n\nConduction paths\n\nSolid conduction needs little discussion. Joints, however, need special consideration. The\nthin air gap between the non-contacting areas of a simple bolted joint contributes signifi-\ncantly to the effective conductance of the joint. Under vacuum conditions, this contribution\ndisappears. The conductance of such a joint under vacuum conditions is strongly depen-\ndent on the quality of the mating surfaces and on the bolt tension. These uncertainties\ncan be minimized by the use of interface fillers such as soft metals (e.g. indium foil) or\nloaded polymers (e.g. silver-loaded silicone) [5, 6].\n\nHeat pipes and two-phase systems\n\nTwo-phase heat transport systems, such as heat pipes, loop heat pipes (LHPs) and\ncapillary-pumped loops (CPLs), are devices which transfer heat in the form of the latent\nheat of vaporization, using a volatile working fluid that is circulated by capillary action\nin a porous wick structure. They are capable of large heat transport rates at very low\ntemperature gradients (i.e. very large effective conductance).\n\nA basic heat pipe is shown schematically in Figure 11.8. It consists essentially of a\nsealed tube possessing a porous structure (the wick) on its inside surface and containing\na volatile liquid (the working fluid) in thermodynamic equilibrium with its vapour.

The working fluid and\nwick material are chosen to ensure mutual wetting (i.e. a small contact angle), which\nguarantees retention of the working fluid in the wick. If a temperature gradient exists\nbetween, say, one end of the heat pipe and the other, heat will be absorbed as latent heat\nat the hot end (the evaporator section), as the working fluid evaporates, which will then\nbe given up again by condensation at the cold end (the condenser section). Continued\nevaporation causes the liquid-vapour interface to withdraw into the wick and it is the\nresulting curved meniscus that generates the pressure drop needed to drive the condensed\nworking fluid back to the evaporator.\n\nAssuming that the working fluid perfectly wets the wick material (i.e. contact angle is\nzero), the maximum capillary pressure that can be generated by the wick is given by\n\n?Pmax = 2?\nr0\n\nwhere ? is the surface tension and r0 is the effective pore radius of the wick.\nWith reference to Figure 11.9, the maximum rate dm/dt at which the working fluid\n\ncan be recycled is then governed by\n\n2?\n\nr0\n= (leff sin ?)?g + leff\n\nAwick\n\n?\n\n??\n\ndm\n\ndt\n+ ?Pvap (11.22)\n\nwhere\n? = density of the liquid phase, g = acceleration due to gravity,\n? = dynamic viscosity of the liquid phase, ? = permeability of the wick structure,\n\nleff = heat pipe effective length = ladia + 1/2(levap + lcond),\nAwick = cross-sectional area of wick, ?Pvap = pressure drop in the vapour flow.\n\nlcond\n\nladia\n\nlevap\n\na\n\nFigure 11.9 Heat pipe oriented with evaporator above condenser\n\n\n\n378 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nIn most practical applications, the pressure drop in the vapour is small compared to\nthat in the liquid phase. Equation (11.22) can then be rearranged as follows:\n\ndm\n\ndt\n? Awick\n\nleff\n\n??\n\n?\n\n(\n2?\n\nr0\n? ?gleff sin ?\n\n)\n\nHence, if Hv is the latent heat of vaporization, the maximum rate of heat transport Qmax\nis given by\n\nQmax ? Awick\nleff\n\n??Hv\n?\n\n(\n2?\n\nr0\n? ?gleff sin ?\n\n)\n(11.23)\n\nWhen operating in space (g = 0), it should be noted that the product Qmax leff is a\nconstant for a given heat pipe design\u2014the longer the heat pipe, the smaller its heat\ntransport capability. For this reason, heat pipe performance is often specified in units of\nWatt-metres. The second thing to note in equation (11.23) is the dependence on the angle\nof tilt ? when operating on the ground. Capillary forces are relatively weak forces and\na heat pipe with a performance of several hundreds of Watt-metres under zero-gravity\nconditions may cease to operate on the ground if its evaporator is raised more than a\nfew mm above its condenser section. On the ground, a heat pipe only approximates to its\nzero-gravity performance when tested horizontally. The effect of gravity on performance\nmust be taken into account fully during system design, particularly if a system of several\nheat pipes (e.g. in a radiator) is used or heat pipes are required to be bent into complex\nshapes. It is easy to design heat-pipe-based thermal control systems that prove to be\nunverifiable on the ground!\n\nAs noted above, the pressure drop in the vapour is relatively small. Since the vapour\npressure is a strong (exponential) function of the temperature at the liquid-vapour interface\n(as described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation), the temperature drop in the vapour\nwill also be small. For the purposes of analysing the effect of a heat pipe in a TMM,\nlittle error is introduced by assuming the vapour space to be isothermal and an effective\nconductance heff can be defined, given by\n\n1\n\nheff\n= 1\n\nhevap\n+ 1\n\nhcond\n\nwhere hevap and hcond are the radial conductance values through the wall and wick in\nthe evaporator and condenser zones, respectively. Unlike normal thermal conduction, the\neffective conductance of a heat pipe is not a function of its length. Figure 11.10 shows a\nconstant conductance heat pipe developed for the European Automated Transfer Vehicles\n(ATVs) used to re-supply the ISS.\n\nLHPs and CPLs are variations on the basic heat pipe, designed to improve ultimate\nperformance and/or to improve flexibility of application. In a LHP, the working fluid is\nreturned to the evaporator via an external pipe. The CPL takes the process a step further\nand several evaporators, operating in parallel, may be attached to the same liquid return\nline. This enables the thermal control of complex configurations that would otherwise\nrequire the use of active systems such as pumped liquid loops. Heat pipes, LHPs and CPLs\noften use anhydrous ammonia as the working fluid, since it permits operation over a wide\ntemperature range from approximately ?50?C to about +80?C. Other working fluids are\n\n\n\nTHERMAL TECHNOLOGY 11.6 379\n\nFigure 11.10 Typical constant conductance heat pipe used to conduct heat to a\nradiator. (Reproduced by permission of Euro Heat Pipes, Belgium)\n\navailable, however, allowing heat pipe devices to operate from cryogenic temperatures\nup to several hundred degrees.\n\nDeeper discussion on the subject of two-phase heat transport systems is, unfortunately,\noutside the scope of this text. The interested reader is referred to References [15\u201319].\n\nPhase change materials\n\nPhase change materials (PCMs) can be used where increased thermal capacity is required,\nfor example, to minimize temperature excursions during eclipse or other transient condi-\ntions such as occasional high power dissipation in equipment. They work by absorbing\nor releasing latent heat during solid-liquid phase changes. Care needs to be taken to\nensure that there is sufficient free volume (ullage) to accommodate the volume changes\naccompanying phase change. There should also be sufficient internal structure to ensure\nadequate thermal conduction throughout the PCM material, especially under zero-gravity\nconditions. Typically, a PCM consists of a hydrocarbon wax but many substances are\navailable [20] covering a wide range of temperatures.\n\nInsulation systems\n\nExtremely effective insulation systems can be designed to minimize radiative exchanges in\nthe vacuum of space. These are normally referred to as super-insulation systems or multi-\nlayer insulation (MLI) blankets. They consist typically of several layers of aluminized\nplastic film (e.g. Mylar of Kapton) acting as radiation shields, each separated by a low-\nconductance spacer (e.g. silk, Nylon or glass-fibre net). In practice, in many applications\nthe spacers are omitted and instead alternate layers of aluminized film are crinkled or\nmechanically dimpled to minimize contact between adjacent layers. A typical insulation\nblanket might consist of 40 or more layers, each about 10 ?m thick and aluminized on\n\n\n\n380 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\n0.05\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\nTheoretical\ncurve\n\n0.001\n\n0.0005\n\n0 20 40 60\n\nNumber of aluminized mylar layers\n\n80 100\n\nE\nffe\n\nct\niv\n\ne \nem\n\nitt\nan\n\nce\n  \n\nE\nF\n\nF\n\n?\n\nFigure 11.11 Effective emittance versus number of aluminized Mylar layers\n(theoretical)\n\nboth sides. This would have an effective emittance value of about 0.001. The theoretical\nvalues of effective emittance as a function of number of layers, neglecting the effects of\nconduction between layers, are shown in Figure 11.11.\n\nIt should be remembered that, in practical systems, full account must also be taken\nof edge effects, joints and fasteners. The design of MLI blankets and their method of\ninstallation must also ensure adequate venting, particularly during the rapid depressuriza-\ntion accompanying the launch phase. Further extensive information concerning insulation\nsystems can be found in the literature [6].\n\n11.6.2 Active control\n\nActive thermal control systems are generally more complex than passive systems and\noften consume power and sometimes telemetry resources. Such systems are typically less\nreliable and often heavier. As a general rule, active systems should be used only when it\nhas proved impossible to meet requirements by passive means alone. Active systems will\ntypically be used for very temperature-sensitive equipment (telescopes, scientific instru-\nments, atomic clocks etc.), missions in which environmental conditions are very variable\n(to Mercury, Mars, Europa etc.) or where heat dissipations are large/variable/random (e.g.\nin the cabin of a manned space vehicle). Active thermal control may also be required for\nspecialized payload elements such as infrared sensors.\n\nHeaters\n\nHeaters constitute, probably, the simplest and most obvious active thermal-control\ndevice. A passive thermal-control design may lead to minimum predicted temperatures\nfalling below permissible limits for a given equipment or subsystem. A thermostatically\n\n\n\nTHERMAL TECHNOLOGY 11.6 381\n\ncontrolled heater can be used to prevent this. In view of the high reliability of modern\nthermostats, such a solution may well be considered competitive with alternative passive\napproaches, such as use of PCM units. Other typical applications for heaters include the\npropulsion subsystem (thrusters, fuel lines and valves, tanks etc.), batteries, experiment\nsensors and mechanical actuators. Heaters may be in the form of compact metal-mounted\nresistors, metal co-axial cables in which the heating element forms the core of the cable\n(thermo-coax), or adhesive sheets in which the element is configured rather like a Printed\nCircuit Board (PCB) between two layers of Kapton foil.\n\nVariable conductance heat pipes (VCPHs) and diodes\n\nA variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP ), shown schematically in Figure 11.12,\nis a variant of the simple heat pipe described previously. A non-condensable gas,\ntypically nitrogen, is used to progressively block the condenser section as a function of\nevaporator temperature.\n\nThere are several forms of VCHP\u2014the one illustrated in Figure 11.12 is known as a\ncold, wicked reservoir design. During operation, the vapour always streams from evap-\norator to condenser, so driving the non-condensable gas always towards the reservoir.\nThe reservoir is cold and hence the partial vapour pressure of the working fluid is low.\nMost of the gas in the reservoir is hence composed of the non-condensable gas. Since\nthe vapour can only travel through this gas by diffusion, the vapour flow is effectively\nstopped when it meets the non-condensable gas. Hence, the heat flow to regions of the\ncondenser section that are down-stream of the vapour-gas front is very much reduced.\nThe reservoir is equipped with a wick structure that connects with the main heat pipe\nwick. This ensures that any vapour that does enter the reservoir and condenses will be\nremoved by capillary action. In operation, any increase in evaporator temperature will\ncause the internal pressure to rise. This will compress the non-condensable gas, causing\nthe vapour-gas front to retreat down the pipe and expose a greater length of condenser\nto the vapour flow. The device thus acts as a thermostat and, configured as described,\noperates completely passively. Such a VCHP, used to control the temperature of equip-\nment in the avionics bays of the ATVs, is shown in Figure 11.13. Figure 11.14 shows the\nVCHPs integrated into the avionics bay of ATV-3 (left-hand-side of the picture). Also\nshown (hanging from the crane) is the avionics bay for ATV-2 (Johannes Kepler) in its\nfinal configuration, complete with radiators.\n\nThe ultimate temperature stability that can be obtained using a VCHP depends on the\nratio of the reservoir and condenser volumes\u2014the larger the reservoir, the better the\n\nEvaporator\nsection\n\nAdiabatic\nsection\n\nCondenser\nsection\n\nNon-condensable\ngas reservoir\n\nVapour flow\n\nVapour-gas front\n\nFigure 11.12 Schematic drawing of a cold, wicked VCHP\n\n\n\n382 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nFigure 11.13 A VCHP designed for the European Automated Transfer vehicle (ATV).\n(Reproduced by permission of Euro Heat Pipes, Belgium)\n\nFigure 11.14 VCHPs integrated in the ATV avionics bay radiators\u2014lower left, during\nintegration and, upper right, a completed avionics bay. (Reproduced by permission of\nEADS Astrium)\n\nstability. If even greater temperature stability is required, a heater can be attached to the\nreservoir to control the partial vapour pressure of the working fluid and hence control\nthe position of the vapour-gas front. This enables the vapour-gas front to be moved as a\nfunction of the temperature of the equipment being cooled, allowing temperature-control\nprecision to fractions of a degree.\n\nConsider now the effect of removing the connection between the heat pipe and reservoir\nwicks and omitting the non-condensable gas. Such a device, known as a liquid trap heat\npipe diode [21], is shown schematically in Figure 11.15. When section \u2018A\u2019 is hotter than\nsection \u2018B\u2019, liquid accumulates by condensation in the reservoir until the heat pipe dries\nout and stops conducting. When \u2018B\u2019 is hotter than \u2018A\u2019, the liquid evaporates from the\nreservoir, re-condenses in the heat pipe and the heat pipe works normally. Such a device\ncan be useful, for example, for switching between radiators to prevent backflow of heat\n\n\n\nTHERMAL TECHNOLOGY 11.6 383\n\nA B\n\nHeat pipe Reservoir\n\nFigure 11.15 Schematic drawing of a liquid-trap heat pipe diode\n\nfrom a temporarily sunlit radiator. Use of a heater on the reservoir enables the heat pipe\nto be operated as a thermal switch.\n\nMechanically-pumped two-phase loops\n\nMechanically-pumped two-phase loops are similar to CPLs with the addition of a mechan-\nical pump in the liquid return line. This increases the heat transport capability and also\nrenders the loop less sensitive to instabilities caused, for example, by gas bubbles in the\nliquid lines or nucleation within the evaporators. Such systems would normally be consid-\nered for complex thermal control applications involving large heat transport requirements\nsuch as might be encountered on a large space station.\n\nLiquid loops\n\nPerhaps the simplest concept for the active transport of heat is to use liquid loops , such as\nis used for cooling automobile engines or in the domestic central heating system. Liquid\ncoolant is pumped between the various heat sources (dissipating equipment) and sinks\n(e.g. radiators or inter-loop heat exchangers) by, typically, an electrically-driven centrifu-\ngal pump and temperature control is effected by using by-pass valves. Gas-pressurized\naccumulators , in which flexible diaphragms separate gas and coolant, are used to control\nthe pressure and gas traps are included to minimize the risk of damage from bubbles.\nSince the pump is both a single-point failure risk and the most vulnerable item in the\nloop, the pump package will usually consist of two pump units in cold redundancy.\n\nLiquid loops are inherently rather massive. They would normally only be used where\ntheir particular attribute of system and operational flexibility is required. They find most\napplication in manned spacecraft such as the Shuttle and the ISS. The liquid-loop-based\nactive thermal-control system for the Columbus module on the ISS is shown schematically\nin Figure 11.16.\n\nThe choice of liquid should be made with some care. In order to minimize power\nconsumption, the specific heat should be high (low mass flow rate) and dynamic viscosity\nlow (low drag forces). In order to minimize system mass, the boiling point should be high\n(to minimize containment pressure). However, there must be no risk of freezing during\nany phase of operation, particularly if water is considered, which expands on freezing. For\nuse in cabins containing a human crew, toxicity in the event of leaks must be taken into\naccount. Consequently, water is used in all the manned volumes of the Shuttle and ISS.\nBecause of its undesirable freezing characteristics and high freezing temperature, water\nis not used outside the pressurized modules. Instead, the water loops interface with the\nradiator assemblies via heat exchangers and separate external loops that use low freezing\npoint fluids. The Shuttle uses Freon-21 in its external loop and the ISS uses ammonia.\n\n\n\n384 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nF\nD\n\n1\n\nF\nD\n\n2\n\nF\nD\n\n3\n\nF\nD\n\n4\n\nCore 1\n\nCore 2\n\nCHXASSY\n\nWOOV6W\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n08\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n07\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n06\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n05\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n03\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n04\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n02\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n01\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n09\n\nW\nF\n\nS\nV\n\n10\n\nWater pump assembly\n\nWater modulating valve\n\nWater flow selection valve\n\nWater on-off valve\nWet temperature sensor block\n\nDelta pressure sensor block\n\nLocated on ISS\n\nWTSB1\n\nWTSB2\nWMV2\n\nWOOV9\n\nWOOV10\n\nWOOV8\n\nWOOV4\n\nWOOV3\nWOOV1\n\nWOOV2\n\nW\nO\n\nO\nV\n\n5\nW\n\nO\nO\n\nV\n7\n\nWTSB4\n\nWTSB3\n\nWMV1\n\nWMV4\n\nWTSB6\n\nWTSB5\n\nWMV3\n\nLT\nHX\n\nMT\n\nHX\n\nWPA1\n\nWPA2\n\nDPSB\nC\n\nP\nF\n\nW\nD\n\nC\nP\n\nA\nW\n\nD\n\nA\nD\n\n4\n\nA\nD\n\n3\n\nA\nD\n\n2\n\nA\nD\n\n1\n\nO\nA\n\n1\n\nO\nA\n\n2\n\nFigure 11.16 Schematic diagram of the Columbus water loop. (Reproduced by\npermission of EADS Astrium)\n\nLouvres and shutters\n\nA louvre [6] is a device that varies the effective emittance of a radiator in response to\ntemperature. It is usually\u2014but not always\u2014mounted on the outside of a radiator panel\nand typically consists of an array of metallic blades rather like a venetian blind. The\nconcept is shown schematically in Figure 11.17. When the blades are open (perpendicular\nto the radiator surface), the radiator has a good view of space and radiates accordingly.\nWhen they are closed, however, the radiator sees a low-emittance surface and most of\nits radiated heat is reflected back. The blades may be activated individually, for example,\nby bimetallic springs or by liquid-filled Bourden spiral actuators thermally connected to\nthe radiator, or as a complete assembly by a single actuator. Actuators can be bimetallic,\nhydraulic or electrical, and operate in response to equipment temperatures, radiator tem-\nperatures or computer- or ground-generated commands. Figure 11.18 shows a photograph\n\nLouvre blades (low e)\n\nRadiator surface (high e)\n\nFigure 11.17 Schematic illustration of a louvre\n\n\n\nTHERMAL TECHNOLOGY 11.6 385\n\nFigure 11.18 Louvre assembly developed for ROSETTA. (Reproduced by permission of\nSENER)\n\nof a lightweight louvre assembly driven by bimetallic springs, which was developed for\nthe ROSETTA spacecraft. Louvres operate most effectively when mounted on radiators\nthat are not illuminated by the Sun. In sunlit locations, complex reflections occur that\nmake the prediction of louvre performance complicated and unreliable. Under these cir-\ncumstances, an alternative approach, which was used on the GIOTTO spacecraft during its\nmission to Halley\u2019s Comet, is to partially cover the radiator surface with a motor-driven\nlow-emittance roller-blind made from a sheet of metallized Kapton film.\n\nRefrigerators and heat pumps\n\nA heat pump may be used to increase the temperature of a radiator. Since the amount\nof heat radiated from a surface increases with the fourth power of its temperature, quite\nsmall temperature rises are sufficient for a significant increase in heat dissipation rate.\nThe penalties for this are the mass and power consumption of the heat pump and any\nancillary interfacing equipment such as liquid loops. Under normal circumstances, the\nengineer will find that it is usually better to try to find more radiator area. Exceptions\nwould be where the amount of radiator area is fundamentally limited or where heat must\nbe rejected in a relatively warm environment such as might occur on the lunar or Martian\nsurface during daytime.\n\nThe most common applications are to cool sensors or other equipment in order to\nreduce signal-to-noise ratio and, in the specific case of manned space activities, to provide\nrefrigeration for food and biological specimens resulting from scientific research.\n\nRefrigeration requirements tend to fall within one of four categories, corresponding to\ntemperature ranges.\n\n1. + 4 oC \u2014?20oC . This range is basically concerned with food storage and is\nnormally provided by thermoelectric cooling or mechanical two-phase heat pumps\nbased on the Rankine cycle. Thermoelectric refrigerators are simple, rugged\nand reliable (no moving parts). They are not very efficient thermodynamically,\nhowever, and become very power-hungry when heat loads or the temperature-lift\n\n\n\n386 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\n(i.e. the difference between the cooled equipment and heat sink) become large.\nTwo-phase heat pumps, such as those used in domestic refrigerators/freezers, are\nmore efficient but much more complicated [22], a particular issue being to avoid\ndamage to the vapour compressor due to accidental ingestion of liquid under\nzero-gravity conditions.\n\n2. ?80 ?C. This temperature is used for long-duration storage of biological specimens.\nIt is too cold for thermoelectric cooling and a two-phase refrigerator would require\nseveral stages, involving substantial mass, power and reliability penalties. Instead,\nsingle-phase gas cycles such as the Stirling or Brayton cycles are used [23, 24].\nThe Brayton cycle is a continuous loop, whereas the Stirling cycle is reciprocating\none. The Brayton cycle is inherently easier to interface with a large refrigerator,\nalthough it is not as thermodynamically efficient as the Stirling cycle. The MELFI\nspecimen storage freezer (see Figure 11.19) on the ISS and the NICMOS cooler on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope both use the Brayton cycle.\n\n3. 80 K (?193 ?)C. This is an important temperature for Earth observation spacecraft\nsince it is the temperature needed by the infrared detectors of instruments designed\nto look through, for example, the 8-?m atmospheric window (see Section 11.2.2).\nIf heat loads are low and there is an unrestricted view of space, carefully designed\nradiators can achieve these temperatures. The METEOSAT spacecraft, orbiting at\ngeosynchronous height, use such radiators. In LEO, however, the effect of the Earth\u2019s\nplanetary radiation is difficult to avoid, and mechanical coolers using the Stirling\ncycle are now common [25]. Interest in these temperatures is not limited to Earth\nobservation missions, however. Figure 11.20 shows the Stirling-cycle coolers devel-\noped for the gamma-ray spectrometer on board the Integral space observatory.\n\n4. <4 K . Temperatures in this range are predominantly of interest to astronomers wish-\ning, for example, to measure the cosmic infrared background or detect the infrared\nemission from planets orbiting other stars. Depending on the application, cooling\nmay be required down to the mK range, although it is an arguable point as to whether\nthe achievement of such low ultimate temperatures is legitimately the responsibility\nof thermal control or more properly the province of the instrument developer. Tech-\nniques available for these temperatures [23, 24] include Joule-Thomson, Brayton and\nrelated Claude cycles, sorption cooling, dilution refrigeration, and adiabatic demag-\nnetization (ADR). The Planck spacecraft uses a cascade of radiators, a 20 K sorption\ncooler, a 4 K Joule-Thompson cooler (see Figure 11.21) and finally a Helium dilution\nrefrigerator to achieve the 0.1 K temperature required by its microwave detectors.\n\n11.7 THERMAL DESIGN VERIFICATION\n\nThermal design verification consists of two fundamentally different activities: (1) quali-\nfication of the hardware making up the thermal-control subsystem and (2) verification of\nthe accuracy of the TMM. The latter enables the TMM to be used to make reliable temper-\nature predictions for any particular mission scenario (orbit, attitude, payload operational\ntime-lining etc.).\n\n\n\nTHERMAL DESIGN VERIFICATION 11.7 387\n\nFigure 11.19 Reverse-Brayton-cycle cooler for the MELFI freezer.

(Reproduced by permission of ESA. Image by Alphons Arts)\n\n11.7.1 Hardware verification\n\nAs with any other spacecraft components, thermal-control hardware must be shown to be\nsuitable for its purpose. The optical properties of thermal-control surfaces, the effective\nconductance of joints, and the performance of insulation systems, must be measured.\nThe performance of heat transport loops, heat pipes, cryogenic systems, and so on, must\nbe verified. It is also necessary to verify that the hardware will operate once it is in\nspace (launch vibration tests, vacuum tests, temperature exposure tests) and will continue\nto operate correctly for the life of the mission (life tests). This is achieved by exposing\nqualification samples or units to conditions more severe than will be encountered in flight,\nto verify that the design is suitably robust. The flight hardware will then be tested to limits\nthat also exceed expected flight conditions but are less severe than the qualification values.\nIn many cases the thermal control engineer will be using hardware that has a proven track\nrecord in space (paints, insulation etc.), in which case qualification can be established by\nsimilarity with past applications. However, care should be taken on a case-by-case basis\nto ensure that previously established qualification limits remain valid for the current case.\nFor example, external thermal-control paints that have good performance in an Earth\norbit will probably prove unacceptable in the vicinity of Mercury, because of the high\ntemperatures and intense solar ionizing radiation encountered. It should also be noted\nthat, although the atmosphere is extremely thin at LEO altitudes, it is composed almost\nentirely of atomic oxygen with a very high kinetic temperature (because of the satellite\nvelocity). This environment, particularly when combined with solar UV radiation, can be\nvery damaging for some thin film materials [5].\n\n\n\nTHERMAL DESIGN VERIFICATION 11.7 389\n\n11.7.2 Thermal model verification\n\nIt will be recalled that the TMM is an approximation to the real situation, devised by\nthe thermal control engineer to enable temperature predictions to be made. It is essential\nto verify the accuracy of these models and, where inaccuracies are found, to amend the\nTMM accordingly. This is done by performing thermal balance tests that make use of\nsub-scale or full-size models of spacecraft or parts of spacecraft (e.g. a payload module\nmay be tested on its own if the spacecraft service module to which it is to be attached is\nalready a well-established design).\n\nA spacecraft thermal balance test requires high vacuum conditions to minimize air\nconduction/convection, a heat sink to simulate the cold radiative environment of space\nand heat source(s) to simulate the external heat inputs (Sun, albedo, planetary infrared\nradiation). Facilities to test even small spacecraft are extremely expensive, both to man-\nufacture and to operate. There are therefore relatively few of them and, in Europe, their\nuse is co-ordinated by ESA/ESTEC [26] via the web-based European Environmental Test\nFacility Inventory (EETFI) (http://eetfi.esa.int/). The thermal engineer needs to consider\ncarefully just how accurately the environment needs to be simulated, in order to verify his\nTMM, since the higher the required accuracy the higher will be the cost. It may be neces-\nsary to use a well-collimated and calibrated solar simulator to verify the external thermal\ninterface between spacecraft and environment (including shadowing effects and multiple\nreflections). The absolute value of the simulated solar input is not so important, however,\nprovided it is known. The same applies to the surrounding heat sink\u2014most facilities\nuse matt-black painted shrouds cooled by liquid nitrogen for this purpose. The shroud\ntemperatures are monitored and suitable allowance made in subsequent analysis. Albedo\nand planetary infrared radiation are seldom simulated, although a slightly higher solar\nconstant may be used to ensure that the test article (particularly if it is a real spacecraft)\ndoes not run too cold. A typical test sequence will consist of several steady-state tests at\ndifferent spacecraft attitudes, together with a transient test (e.g. simulating eclipses). Such\na test on a full-size development model of a spacecraft (or, indeed, on the proto-flight\nspacecraft) should provide sufficient information to enable the TMM to be verified and,\nif necessary, \u2018trimmed\u2019.\n\nThese full-size solar simulation tests are expensive, however, and for large modern\nspacecraft problematic owing to the difficulty of getting a very large diameter solar sim-\nulation beam of the required quality. In such cases, adequate verification of the TMM\ncan usually be obtained by a combination of (1) a full-size spacecraft test using infrared\nheaters instead of a solar simulator [27] and (2) verification of the external thermal inter-\nface using a sub-scale model specially designed for the purpose and sized to fit within\nthe beam of available solar simulators.\n\nAs a general rule, the more testing that can be done, the better. However, in practice\nthe amount of testing which a project manager will sanction will be based on compromise\nand will depend on such parameters as criticality of the thermal design, size of current\ntemperature margins, complexity of external geometry, mission operational complexity\nand the project budget. However, the availability of reliable active thermal-control tech-\nniques and increasingly sophisticated thermal analysis tools, and the tendency to base\nnew spacecraft on past well-proven designs, is steadily reducing the need for detailed\nextensive thermal balance testing. Experience indicates that the thermal control engineer\nwill always request more testing than the project manager is prepared to pay for.\n\n\n\n390 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\n11.8 EXAMPLE OF SATELLITE THERMAL\n\nDESIGN\u2014XMM/NEWTON\n\nIn this chapter we have attempted to describe the techniques that are used to devise,\nanalyse and verify a spacecraft thermal design. In practice, every spacecraft is different\nand each thermal design tends to be unique. It will be a compromise between the thermal\nengineer\u2019s desire for perfection and other constraints such as mass, cost and available\npower and telemetry resources. Although designers will attempt to make use of the legacy\nof past successful designs, there is no \u2018standard thermal-control subsystem\u2019. As a rule of\nthumb, the thermal control system will usually constitute between 2 and 5% both of\nspacecraft mass and development cost [28]. An example helps to illustrate the way in\nwhich these design techniques are used on modern spacecraft.\n\nThe X-ray Multi-mirror Mission (XMM) spacecraft [29], subsequently renamed \u2018New-\nton\u2019 and shown schematically in Figure 11.22, is an advanced X-ray observatory that uses\nthree grazing-incidence mirror modules, each containing 58 concentric mirror assemblies,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFocal plane platform\n\nCamera radiators\n\nTelescope tube\n\nOptical monitor\n\nService module\n\nX-ray mirror assemblies\n\nFigure 11.22 \u2018Exploded view\u2019 of the XMM/Newton spacecraft.

The spacecraft \u2018housekeeping\u2019 subsystems are located in the service module\nthat surrounds the mirror modules. The solar arrays are attached to the service module.\nThe mirror modules and focal plane instrumentation are separated by the telescope tube\nthat is about 6.8 m in length. XMM has an overall length of around 10 m and a mass of\nabout 10 tonnes.\n\nIn order to avoid interference from the Earth\u2019s trapped radiation, XMM is in a highly\nelliptical orbit and only performs its observations when well outside the radiation belts.\nSpecifically, it is a 48 h orbit with apogee at 114 000 km and perigee at 7000 km. Obser-\nvations are made during the 40 h of each orbit when it is above 40 000 km. Spacecraft\nattitude is controlled to within \u00b120? of \u2018side-to-Sun\u2019. The inclination of the orbit is 40?,\nso it suffers from periodic eclipse seasons. The eclipses always occur well below the\naltitude at which observations are made, however, and never exceed 1.7 h. Under these\ncircumstances, the external thermal environment is rather stable. There is little influence\nfrom the Earth, even during an eclipse season, and none during observing periods, and\nthis has been taken advantage of in the thermal design.\n\nThe most critical requirement of the thermal design [30] was to ensure that thermal dis-\ntortions would not jeopardize the alignment of the X-ray telescope (which has a 7.5 m focal\nlength) or the relative alignment between this telescope and, for example, the star track-\ners. This translated into a requirement to control the temperature of the mirror modules\nand mirror support platform (which also supports the star trackers) at an average tem-\nperature of 20?C, and to limit temperature gradients to less than 2?C. This was achieved\nby equipping each mirror module, the mirror support platform and the entry and exit\nbaffles with heaters controlled by the mirror thermal control unit (MTCU). The heaters\nare pulse-modulated with a duty cycle that is updated periodically by command from the\nground. This approach was made possible by the large thermal mass and stable external\nenvironment. The surrounding service module is maintained at an average temperature of\n15?C by a combination of equipment dissipation and thermostatically controlled heaters.\nThe service module (Figure 11.23) is insulated from the environment by multi-layer super-\ninsulation blankets, except for the panel radiators. At the other end of the spacecraft, the\nfocal plane instrumentation compartment is controlled passively under normal operating\nconditions. If an instrument is turned off, its thermal dissipation is automatically replaced\nby switching on equivalent heaters. Contingency thermostats are also provided, which\nwill switch these heaters on or off if an instrument approaches its non-operating tempera-\nture limit for any reason. The sunlit side of the compartment is fully insulated\u2014thermal\nbalance is achieved by adjusting the heat rejected from the shadowed sides. Special cone-\nshaped radiators are provided to cool the camera detectors to cryogenic temperatures. As\nshown in Figure 11.24, these are inclined away from the sun at an angle of 20? to avoid\nany risk of sunlight entering them, as well as being located behind the fully insulated\nsun-shield. The telescope tube is constructed from carbon fibre (high-? surface) and is\nfully insulated externally. This results in a very stable environment with gradients across\nthe tube diameter not exceeding 3?C. No heaters were implemented on the telescope tube.\n\nAs can be seen from the photographs, the thermal design of XMM involves extensive\nuse of MLI blankets. These were typically constructed from 20 double-sided aluminized\nlayers, separated by Dacron net spacers, together with an outer layer of carbon-\nimpregnated Kapton. This black outer layer, which gives XMM its rather sinister black\nappearance, is electrically conducting and is intended to prevent the build-up of static\n\n\n\n392 THERMAL CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT\n\nFigure 11.23 XMM/Newton lower module showing mirror entry baffles and\nsurrounding service module.

Clarke. He\ndescribed the concept of using geostationary satellites for communications in a paper\nentitled Extra-Terrestrial Relays\u2014Can Rocket Stations Give World-wide Radio Coverage?,\npublished in Wireless World in October 1945 [1]. In the years following the launch of\nSputnik 1, the demand for global communications systems was one of the main driving\nforces\u2014along with military and political considerations\u2014in the rapid development of\nspace technology. Today the need for communication satellites, boosted by the increasing\nrequirement for communications and entertainment services, is at the heart of the space\nindustry growth.\n\nThe birth of telecommunications by satellite can be seen, perhaps, in the launch of\nTelstar I in 1962. Echo 1, NASA\u2019s first passive communications satellite, was launched\nin August 1960 but Telstar I permitted, for the first time, transoceanic communications by\nsatellite. By today\u2019s standards it was, of course, a very modest affair. Just under a metre\nin diameter and weighing 77 kg at launch, the satellite had one channel with a 50 MHz\nbandwidth, providing about 12 telephony circuits. But it was the start of a revolution in\ninternational communications.\n\nThe low elliptical orbit of Telstar I limited usage for transatlantic communications to\nthree or four half-hour periods in each day. The first successful geosynchronous communi-\ncations satellite was Syncom II, used for experimental transmissions between America and\nJapan. This again had a rather limited capacity, but the design after further improvements,\nbecame the basis for the first commercial communications satellite, Early Bird or, as it\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W. Stark.\n\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n396 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nwas later called, Intelsat I. This satellite, launched in 1965, was similar in size and\nmass to Telstar I but was capable of providing 240 telephony circuits or a high-quality\ntelevision channel.\n\nThe first worldwide satellite communications system was not established, however,\nuntil 1969 when Intelsat III satellites were in position over the Atlantic, Pacific and\nIndian Oceans, giving coverage of all parts of the globe other than the polar regions.\n\nThe subsequent development of satellite communications has been a response to a\ndramatic increase in the demand for international telephone, video and Internet traffic.\nThis extraordinary increase in demand has been matched by a rapid increase in the\nsize, power capability and traffic capacity of the spacecraft, as well as in the number\nof satellites in simultaneous use. There has also been a large increase in the number\nof spacecraft operators, although the global leaders are Intelsat Ltd and SES. In 2001,\nIntelsat changed from a treaty-based organization to a privately held company. As of\n2010 it operates a fleet of over 50 satellites. SES, is a network of satellite operators\nacross the world, with SES Astra operating in Europe and SES World Skies in North and\nSouth America.\n\nGeostationary satellites were first used in 1981 to provide mobile communications to\nthe maritime sector. The initial service provided by the International Maritime Satellite\nOrganisation (INMARSAT ) was based on frequency modulation (FM) telephony and was\nknown as the Standard-A service, which was later renamed Inmarsat-A. Over the last\nthirty years, Inmarsat has evolved its family of services such that aeronautical and land\nenvironments are also served by its network of eleven satellites. Inmarsat won the 2010\nMacRobert award for its Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) service. This pro-\nvides internet data connectivity globally and is used for remote connectivity for business,\ngovernment, broadcasters, aid and relief agencies, and emergency services.\n\nDriven by the huge potential market offered by the introduction of mobile telephones,\nthe end of the twentieth century was notable for a new direction in satellite communi-\ncations, with the introduction of non-geostationary satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\nUnfortunately, by the time these multi-satellite constellation systems (see also Chapter 5)\nwere introduced, terrestrial cellular networks had already substantially eroded the antic-\nipated markets. The existing Iridium, Globalstar and Orbcomm networks all filed for\n\u2018Chapter 11 bankruptcy\u2019 protection shortly after becoming operational but have since\nbeen restructured and continue to provide a service. Further evidence for the growing\ninterest in the mobile communications market was the award in 2010 for a contract for 81\nsatellites to Thales Alenia Space for the Iridium NEXT constellation. The first launches\nare scheduled for 2015.\n\nThe success of satellite navigation has demonstrated the viability of non-geostationary\nsatellite technology. In particular, the US Global Positioning System (GPS ) and the\nRussian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS ) constellations, both of which\nhave their origin in military applications, have successfully been applied to civilian use.\nThe growing reliance of many terrestrial systems on navigation led to the decision by the\nEuropean Union (EU) to develop its own satellite navigation system. With the backing\nof the European Space Agency (ESA) and the EU, Europe will deploy the GALILEO\nnetwork of non-geostationary satellites in 2014. A contract was awarded in 2010 to\nOHB-System and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) to build the first\n14 operational satellites.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 12.1 397\n\n12.1.2 The role of the communications payload\n\nSome early experimental systems, such as Echo 1, used orbiting objects as passive reflec-\ntors or scatterers in order to achieve intercontinental communications. It quickly became\napparent, however, that in order to meet the demand for high traffic capacities it would\nbe necessary to use active satellites containing transponders that receive the signals trans-\nmitted from the ground, change their frequencies and amplify them before re-transmitting\nthem to Earth. Figure 12.1 is a very much simplified block diagram of such a link. The\npower amplification factor (or gain) provided by the satellite is typically in the region of\n1012 \u20131015 (120\u2013150 dB).?\n\nThe most striking difference between a satellite link and a terrestrial link is in the length\nof the transmission path. This is typically about 50 km for a terrestrial microwave link, but\n36 000 km from a ground station to a satellite in geostationary orbit (GEO), or 10 000 km\nto 20 000 km for a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) or 700 km to 2000 km for a LEO.\n\nThe immediate result of this enormous increase in path length is that the most critical\nparameter in a satellite system is normally the available transmitter power\u2014particularly\non the downlink, in which the transmitter power is in turn one of the major demands\non the primary satellite power. For broadcast or multicast services, the huge coverage\narea offered by a geostationary satellite, combined with its fixed position in the sky,\nmakes it particularly suitable for this mode of service delivery. For mobile services,\nthe selection of one particular orbit over another is not so straightforward. The smaller\ncoverage area offered by a non-geostationary satellite, which continuously moves over\nthe Earth, necessitates the need for multi-satellite constellations to guarantee continuous\ncoverage on a regional or global basis. This, in turn, increases the complexity of the\nnetwork infrastructure. However, the reduced transmission distance in comparison with\na GEO, allows the power requirements to be relaxed and results in a reduction in the\nlatency of the link.\n\nSatellite communication is not restricted to the use of circular orbits. For instance,\nsatellites of the Russian Molniya series are in elliptical, high-inclination, zero-drift orbits\nthat allow good coverage of high latitudes. During the slow apogee transit, near GEO\naltitude, the satellite appears almost stationary in the sky, allowing continuous operation\nfor up to about two-thirds of the orbital period (see Chapter 5).\n\nThe system illustrated in Figure 12.1 is one of a large variety of telecommunications\napplications of artificial satellites. The main types of systems are as follows:\n\n\u2022 trunk telephone and television services;\n\u2022 broadcast services;\n\u2022 videoconferencing and other business services;\n\u2022 communication with mobiles (hand-held, ships/aircraft/land vehicles);\n\u2022 data transmission (between ground stations);\n\u2022 data relay (between other satellites and ground stations);\n\u2022 internet access;\n\u2022 navigation;\n\n? In telecommunications engineering, a power ratio (in this case the ratio of output power to input power) is often\nexpressed on a logarithmic scale with decibels (dB) as units. On this scale the ratio P1/P2 is represented by\n10 log10(P1/P2) dB. Thus, for instance, a power ratio of 10 is 10 dB and a factor of 2 is about 3 dB.\n\n\n\n398 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nService\nmodule\n\nCommunications\nrepeater 11 GHz\n\nfilter\n\nLow noise\namp.\n\nTransmit\nfilter\n11 GHz14.5 GHz\n\nfilter\n\nReceiver\nnoise\n\nAntenna\nsubsystem\n\nSky\nnoise\n\nTracking\n\nAntenna\nnoise\n\nReceiver\nnoise\n\nGround\nstation 2\n\nGround\nstation 1\n\nDemodulator\n\n11 GHz\nReceiver\n\n14.5 GHz\ntransmitter\n\nDuplexer\n\nModulator\n\nInput from\nsignal source\n\nUser\ninterface\n\nOutput to\nsignal destination\n\nGround\nsegmentControl\n\nstation\n\nReceiver\nnoise\n\nRanging\n\nDuplexer\n\nTC\nRx\n\nTM\nTx\n\nTT&C\nTrans-\nponder\n\nSpace\nsegment\n\nPower\nsupply\n\nHigh Power\nAmplifier\n\n(HPA)\n\nPrimary\npower\n\nLocal\noscillator\n\nFigure 12.1 Simplified block diagram of a satellite communications link (using the 14.5\nand 11 GHz bands)\n\n\u2022 remote monitoring and meter reading;\n\u2022 fleet management and tracking.\nA single satellite may include transponders for more than one of these functions.\n\n12.1.3 System constraints\n\nThe design of a satellite communications system involves considerations not normally\nrequired for a terrestrial system. In general these design constraints can be divided\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 12.1 399\n\ninto three broad categories: customer requirements, technical requirements and interna-\ntional regulations.\n\nCustomer requirements form the starting point of the design, and are as many and as\nvaried as the customers themselves. Among the parameters that one might expect the\ncustomer to specify would be:\n\n\u2022 type of signals (voice, television, data and so on);\n\u2022 capacity (i.e. number of channels of each type)\u2014or bandwidths and frequencies;\n\u2022 coverage area served by the satellite and the site(s) of the control station(s);\n\u2022 uplink and downlink signal strength and quality\u2014or types of ground terminals to\n\nbe served;\n\u2022 connectivity between different channels and traffic routes;\n\u2022 availability (i.e. times of day/year, permitted outage times and so on);\n\u2022 lifetime (typically seven years for LEO, 12 years for MEO and 12\u201315 years\n\nfor GEO satellites currently in service, but likely to be about 20 years or more for\nfuture designs).\n\nThere may be a further requirement that some of these parameters can be altered in\norbit by command from a ground station and there may also be other limitations such as\na need for a high level of security, both against illicit interception and decoding of signals\nand against interference, jamming and illegal telecommands.\n\nAs with all major engineering projects, however, the most important constraints imposed\nby the customer and market are usually those of cost and timescale.\n\nThe technical constraints (such as transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, interference,\nenvironment, available components etc.), which apply to a terrestrial link generally apply\nalso to a satellite link, but with some additional restrictions. The most significant are those\nimposed by the payload mass, the available power and the need for equipment to survive\nthe launch phase and operate unattended in the space environment.\n\nThe interplay between technical and cost factors is often crucial. In most terrestrial\nsystems, it is possible to guarantee adequate overall performance by allowing generous\nmargins in the design. Such extravagance in the case of a satellite system will result in\nan increase in mass and power consumption and hence increased launcher costs. On the\nother hand, the cost of developing and space-qualifying new tailor-made equipment or of\nelaborate integration and test procedures may mean that the best technical design is not\nthe most cost effective.\n\nInternational regulations for communications systems are required to control possible\ninterference between different systems and to ensure compatibility between the various\nnational systems that may need to be connected end to end.\n\nThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which is now part of the United\nNations Organization exists for the purpose of defining and enforcing international stan-\ndards. More than 190 nations are signatories to its Convention that has the status of\na formal international treaty. Within the ITU, there are two consultative bodies that\ncollate information and formulate policy in relation to telephony and radio communi-\ncations, respectively. These are the ITU\u2014Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) and the\nITU\u2014Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T). A third body, the Telecommu-\nnication Development Sector (ITU-D), is concerned with the technical requirements of the\ndeveloping world.\n\n\n\n400 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nThe recommendations of the ITU-R are in turn considered by the World Radio Con-\nference (WRC) [2] which may then be incorporated into the ITU Radio Regulations [3].\nThese are binding on signatories of the ITU Convention.\n\nAmong the important system parameters subject to international regulation are the\navailable frequency bands, the orbital location and the maximum permitted power flux\ndensity (PFD) at the Earth\u2019s surface. The bulk of telephony and television traffic has been\nin the C-band (4/6 GHz) and Ku-band (11 GHz). Due to overcrowding there is increasing\nuse of the K- and Ka-band between 26 and 40 GHz. New Ka-band satellite broadband\nservices have already started in the US and Canada (e.g. WildBlue \u2014a high speed satellite\ninternet provider), and are expected shortly in Europe with the launch of the HYLAS and\nKaSaT satellite systems.\n\nThe position of a satellite in the GEO is negotiated through the Space Service Depart-\nment. The main requirement is that there should be sufficient separation between locations\nto allow a ground-station antenna of reasonable size (and hence beamwidth) to discrim-\ninate between adjacent satellites. For C- and Ku-band satellites this implies a separation\nof at least 2\n\n?\nof longitude between satellites using the same frequency. Some parts of the\n\norbit are relatively empty, but in others, such as the Atlantic region, where traffic density\nis very high, the choice of location may be very restricted.\n\nIn what follows, we will be concerned primarily with the technical aspects of the system\ndesign. Later we will look at some of the units that make up the telecommunications\npayload but first we must examine some of the principles underlying the operation of the\nsystem as a whole.\n\n12.2 TECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS\n\n12.2.1 Introduction\n\nAlthough most of the important elements of a satellite communications link are shown in\nFigure 12.1, this is a very much simplified picture. In particular, only two communications\nground stations are shown and the system is a simplex (i.e. one-way) link. Nevertheless,\nthe block diagram illustrates some of the features that are common to practically all\nsystems. In fact, the extension to two-way (duplex) operation is often trivial. The same\nsatellite transponder may carry both outgoing and return traffic provided that the same\nuplink and downlink frequencies are available at the two ground stations. However, this\nis not always the case. For instance, in a system serving mobiles, the satellite\u2013mobile\nlink may operate at L- or S-bands (1.5\u20131.7 GHz), and the satellite-fixed Earth station\nlink at C/Ku/X (4\u201318 GHz) or Ka-band (26\u201340 GHz) In this case the satellite must carry\nseparate forward and return transponders.\n\n12.2.2 Modulation\n\nTypes of modulation\n\nThe signals to be transmitted by a communications system normally consist of a band\nof rather low frequencies, ranging, for instance, from a few tens of Hz to a few kHz in\nthe case of speech or from a few tens of Hz to a few MHz in the case of television.\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 401\n\nThese baseband frequencies\u2014those which constitute the original signal\u2014are unsuitable\nfor direct transmission as radio waves.\n\nFor transmission purposes, the signal is imposed on a carrier wave of much higher\nfrequency\u2014a process known as modulation . This is represented in Figure 12.1 by the\nmodulator block in ground station 1. The reverse process\u2014recovery of the baseband\nsignal from the received signal\u2014is known as demodulation . If we represent the high\nfrequency signal by a cosine wave,\n\nV = Vc cos(?ct + ?c) = Vc cos(2? fct + ?c), (12.1)\n\nthen the baseband signal may then be represented by a variation with time of either the\ncarrier amplitude (Vc), its frequency (fc) or its phase (?c).\n\nFigure 12.2 illustrates these three basic types of modulation for the simple case where\nthe baseband signal is itself a cosine wave. As shown in the algebraic expressions repre-\nsenting the waveforms in Figure 12.2, the magnitude of the modulation is represented by\na modulation index , m (also called modulation depth) in the case of amplitude modulation\n(AM) and ? in the case of phase modulation (PM) or frequency modulation (FM). PM\nand FM are different forms of \u2018angle modulation\u2019. Any FM waveform can be represented\nas phase modulation (albeit by a slightly different baseband signal) and vice versa . For\na sinusoidal modulating waveform, ?, the peak phase deviation (in radians), is equal to\n?f /fm where ?f is the peak frequency deviation and fm the modulating frequency.\n\nModulating\ntone\n\nAmplitude\nmodulation\n\nFrequency\nmodulation\n\nPhase\nmodulation\n\nm(t ) = cos(wmt ) = cos(2pfmt )\n\nV = Vc (1 + m cos wmt ) cos[wct + f]\nm = \u2018modulation index\u2019\n\nV = Vc cos[wct + bsin(wmt ) + f]\n    = Vc cos[wct  + Df / fm sin(wmt ) + f]\n b = \u2018modulation index\u2019\n   ?f  = \u2018frequency deviation\u2019\n\nV = Vc cos[wct + bcos(wmt ) + f]\nb = \u2018modulation index\u2019 or\n\n\u2018phase deviation\u2019\n\nFigure 12.2 Types of analogue modulation. (In the interest of clarity the frequency of\nthe carrier is shown very much reduced compared to that of the modulating signal)\n\n\n\n402 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nAnalogue and digital signals\n\nThe modulated carrier waves illustrated in Figure 12.2 are examples of analogue signals.\nThey are characterized by the fact that the instantaneous value of the baseband signal\nmay lie anywhere within a certain range.\n\nThe majority of telecommunications traffic consists of digital signals, that is, signals that\ncan take only a finite number of discrete values\u2014often only two values, corresponding to\nthe binary digits 0 and 1. When the signals are in this form, the three types of modulation\ndescribed above are known as amplitude-shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift keying (FSK)\nand phase-shift keying (PSK).\n\nWithin these general categories there are many variants whose different characteris-\ntics make them suitable for differing applications. Some of the more commonly used\ntechniques are illustrated in Figure 12.3 where, for instance, ASK is shown as \u2018on\u2013off\nkeying\u2019, with a binary 1 represented by full amplitude and a 0 by zero amplitude. FSK is\nillustrated by continuous-phase fast frequency-shift keying (FFSK) in which there are no\ndiscontinuous changes in phase at the frequency transitions and the two frequencies are\nseparated by half the bit rate (i.e. number of binary digits per second).\n\nThis choice of frequency separation has certain advantages concerned with the ease of\ndetection of signals in the presence of noise (see Sections 12.2.4 and 12.2.5).\n\nModulating signal\n\nAmplitude shift keying\n(ASK)\n\nFrequency shift keying\n(FSK)\n\nPhase shift keying\n(PSK)\n\n1 1O O\n\nFigure 12.3 Examples of digital modulation. The examples illustrated are:\nASK\u2014on\u2013off keying; FSK\u2014fast frequency-shift keying; PSK\u2014phase reversal keying (In\nthe interest of clarity, the frequency of the carrier is shown to be very much reduced\ncompared to that of the modulating signal)\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 403\n\nPSK often uses two phases separated by ? radians (as illustrated in Figure 12.3) and\nis then known as phase-reversal keying (PRK) or Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK).\nHowever, another important type of PSK uses four phases separated by ? /2 radians. This\nis quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK). More complicated multi-phase or multi-phase\nplus multi-amplitude schemes may also be used, particularly where there is a need to\nachieve high data rates in a limited bandwidth. The bandwidth is the width of the range\nof frequencies included in the signal, and transmitted by the system.\n\nDigital signals occur naturally, for instance, in the transmission of numerical data or\nin communication between computers. It is also possible to convert analogue signals into\ndigital form. Most telephone traffic is transmitted by digital techniques, and digitized\ntelevision and audio broadcasts are now becoming the norm.\n\nThe conversion of analogue signals into digital form may be described in terms of three\ndistinct steps\u2014sampling, quantization and encoding .\n\nThe sampling process is illustrated in Figure 12.4. Clearly, if it is known that the\nsignal varies with sufficient smoothness between the sample times, the entire signal can\nbe reconstructed with considerable accuracy from the sample values. It can be shown that\nthis is guaranteed if the signal to be sampled contains no frequencies greater than half\n\n(a)\nSignal to\nbe sampled\n\n(b)\nSample\nvalues\n\n(c)\nQuantized\nsamples\n\n(d)\nEncoded\nsignal (PCM)\n\n100\n011\n010\n001\n000\n\nB\nin\n\nar\ny\n\nre\npr\n\nes\nen\n\nta\ntio\n\nn\n\nO O P P P P P P P PO O O O O O O O O O OO\n\nFigure 12.4 Sampling and digitization. The process illustrated here is an example of\npulse code modulation (PCM). Each sample value is represented by a binary number\nwith, in this case, three digits and one extra bit for parity checking.

The\nsymbols marked \u2018P\u2019 are parity bits\n\n\n\n404 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nthe sampling frequency. This is known as the Nyquist criterion . If the sampling speed\nis insufficient an effect called aliasing is observed. This leads to spurious frequencies\nbeing generated.\n\nThe process of quantization involves rounding off each sample to one of a finite number\nof allowed values. This introduces errors that cannot be compensated in subsequent pro-\ncessing of the signal. In order to reduce this quantization noise to an acceptable degree it\nmay be necessary to increase the number of allowable signal levels. However, the greater\nthe number of levels, the greater is the number of digits that are necessary to identify a\nparticular level and hence the greater the required bit rate. This reduces the transmitted\nenergy associated with any one bit, which tends to enhance the signal degradation caused\nby mechanisms other than quantization (see Section 12.2.5). The system designer must\nseek a balance that results in best overall signal quality.\n\nThe final step, that of encoding, may take many forms. The simplest is to express\neach sample value directly as a binary number and then combine the numbers (normally\nwith some extra digits for synchronization\u2014that is, to allow the receiver to identify the\nstart of each binary word) to form a long sequence of binary digits. This is the system\nusually understood by the term pulse code modulation (PCM). However, a number\nof more subtle techniques may be introduced at this stage with a view, for instance, to\nmaking the signals less vulnerable to transmission impairments, providing encryption or\nmodifying the spectrum. Thus digital modulation is in many ways much more flexible\nthan its analogue counterpart.\n\nSpectrum and bandwidth\n\nIn the design of a telecommunications system, one of the most important signal parameters\nis the bandwidth. It is this (among other things) that determines the design of the various\nfilters shown in Figure 12.1. The effect of modulation of a carrier wave is to produce\nfrequencies other than that of the unmodulated carrier, and the resultant spectrum depends\nboth on the baseband signal and on the type of modulation in use. Some particular\nexamples are considered below.\n\nIn the case of amplitude modulation by a co-sinusoidal signal, the spectrum may be\ninferred from standard trigonometrical identities, for example,\n\nVc(1 + m cos ?mt) cos ?ct = Vc[cos ?ct + (m/2) cos(?c + ?m)t\n+ (m/2) cos(?c ? ?m)t] (12.2)\n\nThe components at frequencies (?c + ?m) and (?c ? ?m) are known as sidebands and\nthe term Vc cos ?ct is the carrier component . An increase in the modulation index m\nresults in increased sideband levels but no change in the range of frequencies present in\nthe signal. This is illustrated in Figure 12.5(a).\n\nA simple development of equation (12.2) shows that if the baseband signal, m(t),\ncontains more than one frequency, each component of the baseband produces a pair\nof sidebands. In general, if m(t) is not composed of discrete frequencies, its spectrum\nmay be represented by its Fourier transform, M (?) = ? m(t) exp(?j?t) dt . Whatever\nthe baseband spectrum, the spectrum of the modulated carrier has the same form but in\nbands located symmetrically above and below the carrier frequency. The required channel\nbandwidth is twice the base bandwidth (irrespective of modulation depth).\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 405\n\nModulated carrier\n\nHigh modulation\nindex\n\nLow modulation\nindex \n\nBaseband\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nfm\n\nfm\n\nfb 2fb\n\nfc ? fm fc + fm \nfc\n\nfc ? fm fc + fm \n\nfc ? fb \n\nfc\n\nfc fc + fb \n\nfc? fm fc+ fm \nfc ? 2fm fc fc + 2fm \n\nFigure 12.5 Spectra of modulated signals: (a) amplitude modulation (amplitude\nspectrum); (b) frequency modulation (amplitude spectrum) and (c) phase-reversal\nkeying (power spectrum). The AM and FM spectra show modulation by a single tone of\nfrequency fm. The PRK spectrum is for a random binary sequence at a bit rate\nof fb bits/s\n\nThe spectrum of a frequency (or phase)-modulated signal is considerably more compli-\ncated. In the case of co-sinusoidal modulation with a small modulation index, ?, the pres-\nence of sidebands similar to those for AM may again be demonstrated by standard trigono-\nmetrical identities. If, however, the index is not small, the spectrum of FM is in striking\ncontrast to that of AM. Fourier analysis of expressions, such as cos(?ct + ? sin ?mt),\nyields an infinite set of components at frequencies (fc \u00b1 nfm) (where n takes all integer\nvalues) and with amplitudes that can be evaluated from Bessel functions of the first kind.\nThe number of side frequencies having significant amplitude (and hence the effective\nbandwidth) increases with increasing ? (Figure 12.5b).\n\nWhen the baseband is not a single sine wave, the side frequencies are no longer related\nin a simple way to the baseband frequencies. For instance, if the baseband contains\n\n\n\n406 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\ntwo frequencies f1 and f2, the modulated signal contains all frequencies of the form\nfc \u00b1 nf1 \u00b1 mf2 (where n , m are integers). In strictly mathematical terms, the bandwidth\nis infinite but there is a useful semi-empirical expression (Carson\u2019s formula) for the\nbandwidth containing about 98% of the power:\n\nCarson bandwidth = 2(?f + fm) (12.3)\n\nwhere ?f is the peak frequency deviation and fm is normally taken to be the highest\nfrequency present in the baseband. Frequency modulation with index sufficiently small\nso that only the first-order sidebands are significant (? less than about 0.5) is known as\nnarrow-band FM (NBFM), while for larger ? the term wide-band FM (WBFM) is used.\n\nIn the case of phase-shift keying the spectrum depends both on the type of modulation\n(PRK, QPSK etc.) and on the encoding procedure used in producing the bit stream. As an\nexample, we may consider PRK by a random binary signal (i.e. by a random sequence of\n0s and 1s occurring with equal probability). A signal of this type does not have a Fourier\ntransform but we may define a power-density spectrum S (f ) that is the power per Hz of\nbandwidth at the frequency f . For the random binary signal, we have\n\nS (f ) = V 2T (sin ? fT )2/(? f T )2 (12.4)\n\nwhere V is the signal voltage and T is the length (in time) of one bit.\nSince PRK may be regarded as a type of ASK (the amplitude is switched between +A\n\nand ?A), the spectrum of the modulated signal is similar to the baseband spectrum but\ncentred on the carrier frequency. This is illustrated in Figure 12.5(c). Strictly speaking,\nthe overall bandwidth is infinite because, in this case, the baseband has infinite bandwidth.\nHowever, the power in the \u2018tails\u2019 of the spectrum is not very significant, the first subsidiary\nmaxima already being some 13 dB below the central peak. In practice, therefore, it is usual\nto transmit at most, that part of the spectrum that lies between the first zeros. In many\ncases less will suffice. This has the effect of partially smoothing out the phase transitions,\nthough without destroying the baseband information completely. Since 1/T is the number\nof bits per second, the effective bandwidth for the random binary signal is between one\nand two times the bit rate.\n\nIf the binary signal results from digitizing an analogue signal, the bit rate depends both\non the base bandwidth and on the required level of quantization errors. For instance, for\nspeech (bandwidth 4 kHz) quantized to 256 levels, the bit rate is 64 kbit/s since there\nmust be at least 8000 samples per second with 8 binary bits per sample.\n\nMuch effort has been concentrated on devising digital techniques that make more\nefficient use of bandwidth in particular applications. An important example is speech\nencoding, when used in mobile communications. PCM is an unnecessarily powerful and\ngeneral technique for this purpose, since it can reproduce all waveforms satisfying the\nNyquist criterion\u2014including waveforms that are not produced by the human voice and\nmake no contribution to the intelligibility of speech. Encoding techniques modelled on\nthe mechanisms of voice production or sensitive to the statistics of the speech waveform\nallow speech transmission of adequate quality at a rate of 2.4 kbit/s. Digital television,\nby using the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG-2) coding standard, requires bit rates\nof the order of 5\u20137 Mbit/s, and about 25 Mbits/s for High Definition Digital Television\n(HDTV). In both cases, this is a significant reduction compared to the 100 Mbit/s that\nwould be required if a simple PCM approach were to be adopted.\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 407\n\n12.2.3 Multiple access\n\nIt is a requirement of most systems that several users (in some cases very many users)\ncan pass signals through the satellite simultaneously. There are three main techniques\nfor doing this. In frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) each user transmits a signal\non a different carrier frequency, and at the receiving station the signals are separated by\nfrequency-selective filters. The signals in this case are often analogue in nature.\n\nIn the case of digital signals, time-division multiple access (TDMA) or code-division\nmultiple access (CDMA) may be used. In TDMA, an individual user transmits short bursts\nof digits in a particular time-slot within a repeating time-frame. Other users occupy\ndifferent time-slots within the same time-frame. Synchronization signals are included,\nwhich allow the receiver to identify the start of the frame, and select those time-slots that\ncontain a particular \u2018message\u2019. The concentration into short bursts has the result that each\nsignal occupies the whole of the channel bandwidth. However, no two signals occur at\nthe same time. The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital cellular\nsystem, currently the most popular mobile system in the world uses this technique.\n\nIn CDMA, each signal uses the full channel bandwidth but the signals may well all\nbe present at the same time. In Direct Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA), the carrier signal\nis modulated twice, first by the required signal and then by a pseudo-random sequence\nof binary digits at a much higher bit rate. A receiver using the correct pseudo-random\ncode can undo the effect of the second modulation and so recover the original signal.\nIt does not, however, recover the signals of other users who have employed different\ncodes. An alternative to DS-CDMA is frequency hopping. This involves changing the\ntransmission frequency pseudo-randomly across the available bandwidth. At the receiver,\nthe same pseudo-random sequence is used to synchronize with the transmitted frequency,\nto allow demodulation of the original signal. Most satellite applications employing CDMA\nuse DS-CDMA. In both cases the net result is that the signal transmitted is spread over\na much larger bandwidth than the original signal and these techniques are known as\nspread spectrum systems . Hybrid multiple access schemes, comprising combinations of\nthe three techniques, are also employed. For example, a FDMA\u2013TDMA scheme involves\nthe division of the available bandwidth into channels (FDMA), each of which contains a\nTDMA frame.\n\n12.2.4 Noise\n\nTelecommunications would present few problems were it not for the presence of \u2018noise\u2019 in\nall electrical systems. In radio communications, electrical noise is a result of the random\nthermal motions of atoms and electrons in matter, which reveal themselves as small\nrandomly varying electromotive forces and currents. Each resistive element in a circuit\nis a source of thermally generated electrical power of kT watts per Hz of bandwidth\nin the radio frequency (RF) range, where k = 1.38 \u00d7 10?23 J/K (Boltzmann\u2019s constant),\nand T is the temperature (in Kelvins) of the resistor (throughout this section it should\nbe assumed that temperatures are measured on the absolute scale, that is, at 0\n\n?\nCelsius,\n\nT = 273 K).\n\n\n\n408 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nSignal\n\nPDF\n\nPn (x)\n\nNoise x\n\nFigure 12.6 Signal and noise voltage waveforms\n\nQuantum mechanics predicts a power spectral density given by the expression,\n\nP0(f ) = hf\nexp(hf /kT ) ? 1 +\n\nhf\n\n2\n(12.5)\n\nwhere h = 6.625 \u00d7 10?34 J s is Planck\u2019s constant. If hf <<kT this reduces to P0(f ) = kT .\nThe essential differences between a noise voltage and a typical signal are illustrated in\n\nFigure 12.6. The signal has a regular quasi-periodic structure whereas noise is essentially\nirregular and unpredictable. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value may be used as a measure\nof noise magnitude, but a complete specification must include the probability density\nfunction (PDF), that is, the probability pn(x)?x that the instantaneous voltage lies in the\nrange from x to x + ?x . For many sources of noise the PDF is approximately Gaussian,\nin which case pn(x) takes the form\n\npn(x) = 1\n?n\n\n?\n(2?)\n\nexp\n\n(?x 2\n2? 2n\n\n)\n(12.6)\n\nwhere ?n is the r.m.s. value.\nWhen two independent sources of noise are combined, it is their powers (or mean\n\nsquared values) that must be summed. In particular, the noise powers contained in different\nfrequency ranges are additive, so that for a constant power spectral density, P0(f ) = kT\nW/Hz, the total power in bandwidth B is given by\n\nP = kTB (12.7)\n\nThe importance of noise is that it sets a fundamental limit to the sensitivity of a telecom-\nmunications receiver. The crucial factor that determines the overall performance of the\nsystem is not just the signal power itself, but rather the ratio of signal power to noise\npower, that is, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\n\nIn any communications system there are many possible sources of noise. However,\nthe signal power reaches its lowest level at the end of the transmission path and it is\ntherefore the noise generated in the input circuit of the receiver which is most critical in\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 409\n\nP = GkT\nPin = kT\n\nPout = Gk (T + Tamp) \n\nP = GkTamp\n\nGain G\n\n(Temperature T ) \n\nFigure 12.7 Definition of noise temperature\n\ndetermining the system performance. For this reason, noise is shown in Figure 12.1 as an\nextra input to each of the receivers\u2014a convenient fiction that has much the same effect\nas the reality.\n\nThere are two commonly used ways of expressing the \u2018noisiness\u2019 of an amplifier (or\nradio receiver). In the first, the expression for thermal noise power available from a\nresistor, P0(f ) = kT , is used to express the noise output as an equivalent temperature.\nThe concept is illustrated in Figure 12.7.\n\nIf the amplifier were an ideal noise-free device, the noise power density kT delivered\nby the source resistance would give an output power density GkT , where G is the gain.\nIn practice, the output is greater than this and we can write\n\nPout(f ) = Gk(T + Tamp) (12.8)\n\nwhere Tamp is known as the noise temperature of the amplifier. The noise temperature\nis thus the additional noise power originating in the amplifier expressed as an equiva-\nlent increase in the source temperature. Note that noise temperatures, like noise powers,\nare additive.\n\nIn the second method of expressing the noise performance of the amplifier, we assume\nthat (in the arrangement of Figure 12.7) the source resistance is at a standard temperature\nT0. Were the amplifier noise-free, the output power spectral density would then be kT 0G\nbut in reality it is greater than this by a factor F , the noise factor (or noise figure):\n\nPout(f ) = FGkT0 (12.9)\n\nFrom equations (12.8) and (12.9) it can be seen that\n\nF = 1 + (Tamp/T0) (12.10)\n\nThe standard choice of T0 is 290 K\u2014a typical \u2018room temperature\u2019.\nA receiver may consist of a chain of amplifiers with different gains and noise temper-\n\natures. As might be expected, the total noise temperature can never be better than that\nof the first stage, and moreover for a given first stage noise temperature, the total noise\ntemperature is minimized by making the first stage gain, G1, as large as possible.\n\nIn addition to the noise originating in successive amplifier stages, the overall system\ntemperature Tsys will include background noise received by the antenna (usually\nrepresented by an antenna temperature) and a (usually small) contribution transmitted\nwith the signal.\n\nAntenna noise results mainly from thermal radiation from various surfaces, which may\nbe either in the \u2018main beam\u2019 of the antenna or in the less sensitive \u2018sidelobes\u2019 (see\n\n\n\n410 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nSection 12.2.8). These include, for instance, the Earth\u2019s surface (at about 300 K), the\nMoon (about 200 K) and the Sun (about 6000 K). Also, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere emits\nthermal radiation when its attenuation becomes significant, as during a rainstorm (see\nSection 12.2.7). If the attenuation factor in a rainstorm is ? (>1), the contribution of the\natmosphere to antenna temperature is\n\nTatmos = T (1 ? 1/?) (12.11)\n\nwhere the temperature, T , of rain is about 275 K. In the majority of geographical locations,\nin order to achieve the required limits on outage times, it is necessary to design the system\nfor operation with significant atmospheric attenuation (see Section 12.2.7). Under these\nconditions the atmosphere may sometimes be one of the main sources of antenna noise\n(and indeed of system noise) for a ground station, where the receiving antenna is pointing\ntowards the normally \u2018cold\u2019 sky. For an uplink, however, in which the satellite antenna\npoints towards the Earth\u2019s surface, the antenna temperature is always in the region of\n290 K and is little affected by the atmospheric attenuation (though of course the signal\nlevel is affected).\n\nIn the case of a satellite downlink, in which a transparent satellite transponder is\nemployed, the transmitted signal is contaminated by noise originating on the uplink.\nThe system is often designed so that the contribution of the uplink to the system noise is\nabout 10 dB or more below that of the downlink. Under these conditions the transmitted\nnoise causes a 0.4 dB degradation of downlink SNR.\n\n12.2.5 Output signal-to-noise ratio\n\nIn digital systems , the mechanism by which system noise affects the output of a commu-\nnications link differs markedly from the analogue case where noise always degrades the\nsignal. The demodulator must contain one or more threshold detectors, which allocate to\neach received symbol one of the permitted values. If the symbol is correctly identified, the\nnoise has no effect whatsoever. Occasionally, however, the noise voltage is large enough\nto cause the receiver output to lie on the wrong side of the detector threshold and so\nresult in an error in interpretation.\n\nThe probability of error in any one bit\u2014known as the bit error rate (BER)\u2014depends\non the product of the received signal power and the length of the bit interval\u2014that is,\non the received energy per bit. For typical transmission systems the BER, Pe, may lie in\nthe range 10?3 \u201310?9. The dependence of BER on the ratio of bit energy to noise power\ndensity (Eb/N0) is shown for two types of binary PSK demodulation in Figure 12.8. These\nare ideal theoretical curves. In practice the value of Eb/N0 needed for a given error rate\nmay be 1\u20132 dB higher than shown.\n\nThe BER Pe can be significantly improved by the use of encoding techniques that per-\nmit error detection and correction at the receiver (this is forward error correction\u2014FEC ).\nThe simplest form of error detection is illustrated in Figure 12.4(d). The values of the\nparity bits are assigned so that the number of 1s in each binary \u2018word\u2019 is (in this case)\neven. If at the system output a word is received with an odd number of 1 s, it is known\nthat an error has occurred (it is assumed in this case that the probability of two errors\nin the same word is negligible). The same principle\u2014that of transmitting more bits than\nare strictly required by the data\u2014is used in more sophisticated coding techniques, which\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 411\n\n10?2\n\nCoherent PRK\n\nDPSK\n\n10?4P\ne\n\n10?6\n\n10?8\n2 4 6\n\nEb/N0(dB)\n\n8 10 120\n\n100\n\nFigure 12.8 The effect of noise on digital systems. (a) BER versus Eb/N0 for two types\nof system. In coherent PRK, the phase of each received bit is compared with that of a\nreference carrier derived separately from a long sample of the signal. In differential PSK\n(DPSK), the phase of each bit is compared with that of the preceding bit. White\nGaussian noise, perfect synchronization and optimum detection are assumed\n\nnot only reveal the presence of errors but also (except in very improbable circumstances)\nmake it possible to identify and so correct the offending bits. The consequent reduction\nin error rate more than offsets the effect of the required increase in bit rate.\n\nThere are two main types of FEC codes; block and convolutional codes. If a block\ncode is used the input data is divided into pre-determined fixed length data symbol blocks\nand the code added converts them into fixed-length code blocks. This type of code is\nparticularly appropriate if bursts of errors are expected. Convolutional codes work on\nbit or symbol streams of arbitrary length and work particularly well if the errors occur\nrandomly. The two types of code are often used together in a concatenated code that is\ntypically used for interplanetary missions where power is very limited.\n\n12.2.6 Choice of modulation and access systems\n\nThe output SNR is one of the main factors in determining the choice of modulation\ntechnique. Other factors of primary importance are the equipment complexity, the payload\nelectrical efficiency, the spectral occupancy and the general system efficiency, flexibility\nand adaptability.\n\nIf simplicity of the equipment and efficient use of spectrum were the only significant\nrequirements, the natural choice would be AM. However, currently, this is rarely, if ever,\nthe final choice.\n\nWide-band FM allows a specified S/N0 to be achieved with considerably less power\nthan is required for AM. Moreover, unlike in AM, the transmitter may be operated in a\nmore efficient non-linear mode. Wide-band FM has been used extensively in the past for\ntranscontinental television and multi-channel per carrier (MCPC) telephony, but today\nthe approach is to employ digital methods. When many small Earth stations or mobile\n\n\n\n412 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nstations are involved, it is usual to employ PSK with a single channel per carrier (SCPC).\nAs with FM, the use of PSK results in a constant amplitude signal, hence it does not rely\non strict linearity to avoid signal distortion, as would be the case in AM. The composite\nsignal formed by adding several individual carriers is not itself of constant amplitude.\nDistortion of the amplitude waveform by a non-linear circuit results in the generation\nof intermodulation (IM) products the frequencies of which are related to (but not the\nsame as) the input frequencies (see Section 12.3.2). It is usually necessary to operate the\ntransmitter at reduced efficiency in order to keep the in-channel carrier-to-intermodulation\npower ratio (C /I ) above a specified value\u2014typically 15\u201320 dB\u2014when the transponder\nis fully loaded.\n\nThe most effective way of avoiding IM products is to use TDMA. In this system no\ntwo signals are amplified at the same time, so there is no IM even when the transmitter\nis operated in a highly non-linear mode. The increased transmitter efficiency is partially\noffset by the need to transmit extra pulses for synchronization, for channel identification\nand to give the demodulators time to lock on to each signal in turn.\n\nWhen the signals originate in analogue form, TDMA suffers from the fact that PCM\nrequires more bandwidth than analogue modulation. However, there is compensation in\nthe much greater flexibility of TDMA in switching and routing signals and in multiplexing\nsignals of differing bandwidths and differing types in a variety of configurations.\n\n12.2.7 Radio propagation\n\nLatency\n\nRadio waves consist of a system of electric and magnetic fields that travel through free\nspace at a velocity of about 3 \u00d7 108 m/s. The transit time for a round trip to a satellite\nin GEO and back is thus about 0.24 s. If other normal delays from network sources\nare included this gives a typical one-way connection latency of 500\u2013700 ms from the\nuser to the internet service provider (ISP) for an internet link\u2014much greater than the\npropagation delays normally encountered in communication links. A number of techniques\nhave been used to reduce the overall latency encountered. Whilst the speed of light is\nconstant, the protocols used can be modified to reduce the number of round trips to\nthe satellite that are required. In addition recent technology developments have led to\nTransparent Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) acceleration being used to increase\nthroughput without requiring any changes in end-system TCP implementations.\n\nPolarization\n\nIn propagation through uniform isotropic media, the electric and magnetic fields are at\nright angles both to each other and to the direction of propagation. In a plane-polarized\nwave, the direction of the electric field lies in a fixed plane as shown in Figure 12.9(a). If\na second wave travelling in the same direction has its plane of polarization at right angles\nto the first, then the two waves will propagate independently and indeed may carry quite\ndifferent signals. A suitable (ideal) receive antenna could absorb all the power from one\npolarization while completely rejecting the other. The two polarizations are said to be\northogonal.\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 413\n\nElectric field E\n\nDirection of\npropagation\n\nDirection of\npropagation\n\nDirection of\npropagation\n\n(a)\n\nE1 (phase 0\u00b0) E1 (phase 0\u00b0)\n\nE2 (phase 90\u00b0)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nE\nE\n\nP P\nH\n\nH\nH H\n\nE2 (phase 90\u00b0)\n\nMagnetic\nfield H\n\nFigure 12.9 Field vectors in electromagnetic waves: (a) a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of a linearly\npolarized wave at a particular instant in time. The electric and magnetic fields are\nrepresented here by geometrical vectors; (b) representation of the E- and H-fields at a\nparticular point, P, in space in a circularly polarized wave and of the E-fields of\ncomponent linearly polarized waves with a 90? phase difference and (c) the same for\nelliptical polarization\n\nIf the two orthogonal plane-polarized waves are identical, apart from a phase difference\nof ? /2 radians, then the combination can be regarded as a different type of polarization.\nIn this case the electric field vector at any point in the propagation path rotates, the tip (in\na geometrical representation) following a circular path if the two plane-polarized waves\nare of equal amplitude. This is known as circular polarization . It may be either right- or\nleft-handed, depending on whether the vector rotates clockwise or anticlockwise, when\nviewed by an observer looking in the direction of propagation. Figure 12.9(b) shows\nthe right-handed version. More generally, if the two plane-polarized waves are not of\n\n\n\n414 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nequal amplitude, orthogonal and in quadrature, the result is elliptical polarization (see\nFigure 12.9c).\n\nLeft- and right-handed circular polarizations are orthogonal and may be received inde-\npendently by suitable antennas (see Section 12.3.3).\n\nPropagation in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n\nFor most of their journey the signals from a satellite propagate through what is essen-\ntially free space, and they travel without change, apart from the steady diminution in\nintensity in proportion to 1/r2 as the distance r from their source increases. In the last\nfew kilometres, however, as they pass through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, they encounter\nphenomena of an unpredictable nature that may significantly affect the system perfor-\nmance. These atmospheric effects can be divided into two categories, those that occur in\nthe ionosphere and those that occur in the troposphere. Ionospheric effects are very impor-\ntant at low and medium frequencies but in general their magnitude varies as 1/f 2 and at\nthe microwave frequencies used for satellite links, they can normally be ignored. Tropo-\nspheric propagation phenomena, however, can be of considerable significance. There are\nthree main effects\u2014refraction, attenuation and scintillation\u2014but of these it is usually\nonly attenuation that can cause serious problems to the system designer.\n\nAtmospheric refraction causes a slight shift in the apparent elevation of the satellite.\nThe magnitude of the shift depends on the elevation as well as on the atmospheric pressure\nand water vapour content. For a standard atmosphere, the shift is given approximately by\n\nR = 0.02\ntan[e + 0.14 + 7.32/(e + 4)]degrees (12.12)\n\nwhere e is the true elevation in degrees. Minor variations caused by differing climatic\nconditions can readily be accommodated by causing the ground-station antenna to track\nthe satellite.\n\nAttenuation in the troposphere has two causes. The first is molecular absorption by\ngases, illustrated by Figure 12.10. This shows the attenuation as functions of frequency for\noxygen and water vapour, which together account for nearly all of the gaseous absorption\nin the atmosphere. Both curves display strong absorption bands, and although these occur\nat higher frequencies than have so far found extensive use in satellite communications,\nthe water vapour band centred on 22.2 GHz will certainly be a significant effect at 20 and\n30 GHz. It is also of some interest that the strong absorption by oxygen at 60 GHz makes\nthis frequency very suitable for inter-satellite links, operating above the atmosphere that\nprovides a screen against interference from terrestrial sources. Apart from the microwave\nabsorption bands, the background attenuation shows a steady rise with frequency owing to\nthe tails of absorption bands in the far infrared. This clear-air attenuation is generally neg-\nligible at frequencies below 10 GHz but is not entirely insignificant at Ku-Band and above.\n\nMuch more dramatic attenuation effects are caused by rain. Water droplets both scat-\nter and absorb radiation, the effect being strongest when the drop size is of the order\nof a wavelength. Thus in the microwave range, for which the wavelength is larger\nthan a raindrop, the attenuation increases with frequency. Semi-empirical curves may\nbe obtained showing attenuation as a function of frequency for various rainfall rates\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 415\n\nRange of values\n\nTotal\n\n1 2 5 10 2\n\nFrequency , f (GHz)\n\nSurface pressure: 1 013 hPa\nSurface temperature: 15\u00b0C\nSurface humidity: 7.5 g/m3\n\n510\n?2\n\n102\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10?1\n\n102\n\n103\n\n10\n\n2\n\n5\n\nZ\nen\n\nith\n a\n\ntte\nnu\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(d\n\nB\n)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n5\n\n2\n\n5\n\n2 3.5\n\nDry air Dry air\n\nH2O\n\nH2O\n\nFigure 12.10 Total dry air and water vapour attenuation at the zenith from sea level [4]\n(Reproduced by permission of International Telecommunication Union)\n\n\n\n416 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nassuming reasonable models of drop-size distribution and of rain-cell size. Since attenu-\nation by rain is very variable, the system designer must seek some way of deciding what\nperformance margin is reasonable to allow for the occasional deep fade. It is usual for\nthe customer to specify an allowable outage time and of this some will be allocated to\nloss of signal because of rain. The designer must then attempt to predict the atmospheric\nattenuation that will not be exceeded for more than this allocated time. Ideally, experi-\nmentally determined statistics of attenuation may be available for the site of the ground\nstation. Otherwise, it will be necessary to use an approach such as that provided by the\nITU-R, which has adopted a general method for the conversion of rainfall statistics into\npredictions of attenuation [5]. The method provides attenuation values as a function of\nprobability of occurrence, RF, ground station location and satellite elevation. When local\nrainfall statistics are not available, use may be made of maps of rainfall rate given in\nReference [6]. For temperate climates, typical fade margins are in the region of 2 dB at\n11 GHz and 3.5 dB at 14.5 GHz, for a link reliability of about 99.9%.\n\nScintillation , or rapid fluctuation in signal amplitude analogous to the twinkling of stars,\nis normally a small effect that for most purposes can be ignored. However, at low eleva-\ntions, because of the longer atmospheric path, all propagation effects are greatly enhanced\nand under these conditions scintillation depths of several decibels are not unusual. As a\ngeneral rule, satellite links are not operated at elevations less than about 10? but in some\ncases this cannot be avoided. The importance of scintillation is that, along with clear-air\nattenuation, it causes a slight reduction in capacity (and hence, in a commercial system,\nloss of revenue) at all times. In the long term this may be as serious as the occasional\ndeep signal fade\u2014especially in systems that are able to compensate for short-term fades\nin some of the signals by, for instance, redistributing the power allocated to individual\nchannels or by changes in coding parameters.\n\nAnother consequence of rain is signal depolarization . Because raindrops are slightly\nflattened, they absorb one plane of polarization rather more than the other. Since the\naxis of the drops is in general inclined to the plane of polarization of the signal, this\ndifferential absorption causes a slight rotation of the plane, or in the case of a circularly\npolarized signal, a slight ellipticity of polarization. The resulting power loss due to mis-\nmatch between the signal polarization and that of the receiving antenna is not significant.\nHowever, the presence of the orthogonal polarization, albeit at a level well below that\nof the wanted polarization, can have a serious impact on systems employing frequency\nreuse by polarization discrimination (see Section 12.2.9).\n\nOne further propagation effect that requires mention is multi-path\u2014that is, the simulta-\nneous presence of two or more transmission paths between the satellite and Earth terminal.\nThis may happen occasionally because of abnormal tropospheric conditions but it is more\ncommonly caused by reflections from the ground or buildings. Signals arriving by the\nindirect path may interfere either constructively or destructively with the main signal,\nresulting in signal enhancement or fading. Since the conditions of interference depend on\nthe difference in wavelengths between the path lengths, the transmission loss may vary\nrapidly with frequency across the channel bandwidth, causing signal distortion. Multi-\npath does not usually present any problems in fixed-satellite services where the Earth\nstations are well sited and employ narrow beam antennas (which can select just one of\nthe arrival directions). However, in the mobile services using low gain Earth terminal\nantennas, possibly in an urban environment, additional link margins are required to allow\nfor multi-path (as well as for shadowing by buildings etc.)\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 417\n\n12.2.8 Antennas\n\nThis section covers the general properties of antennas as they affect the telecommunica-\ntions system. Various types of on-board antenna will be discussed later (Section 12.3.3).\nThe description will, in general, be expressed in the terminology of transmission, but it\nwill apply equally well to reception. The main properties of an antenna\u2014such as gain\nand beamwidth\u2014are the same for the two functions.\n\nRadiation pattern and beamwidth\n\nNo antenna is strictly isotropic. That is, no antenna radiates or receives signals with equal\nintensity (or sensitivity) in all directions. Indeed, most antennas are designed specifically\nso that they radiate very strongly in just one direction.\n\nThe directional properties can be represented by a polar plot of the radiated field inten-\nsity or power as a function of direction. A two-dimensional section through this pattern\nis known as a polar diagram (see Figure 12.11). It is seen that most of the radiation is\nemitted within a narrow range of directions known as the main beam . There are other\ndirections in which radiation emerges, albeit at considerably lower level, known as side-\nlobes . Their importance lies in the fact that they may contribute significantly to antenna\nnoise and to interference from, and to, other systems. Figure 12.11(b) also illustrates the\nconcept of beamwidth, which is usually measured between ?3 dB points (as shown) but\nit is sometimes specified between other limits such as ?1 dB, ?4 dB or between the first\nminima in the radiation pattern. Beamwidth is related to antenna size. Many microwave\nantennas consist of a large physical area, or aperture, illuminated by a single primary feed\nor by many small radiating elements. The most common arrangement is a paraboloidal\nreflector illuminated by a horn (see Section 12.3.3). The radiation pattern measured at a\nlarge distance from such an antenna is the Fourier transform of the distribution of the\nelectromagnetic field in the aperture. It follows directly from the scaling property of the\nFourier transform that beamwidth is inversely proportional to antenna size. A useful rule\nof thumb for calculating the beamwidth is\n\n3 dB beamwidth = 70(?/D)(degrees) (12.13)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nBeamwidth\n\n3 dB\n\nFigure 12.11 Antenna radiation patterns: (a) isotropic antenna and (b) directional\nantenna (large aperture)\n\n\n\n418 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nwhere ? is the wavelength and D the antenna diameter. This formula applies to a circular\naperture with a typical distribution of illumination but it may be used as a rough guideline\nfor most antennas of the \u2018aperture\u2019 type.\n\nIt is not usual to design for uniform illumination. By \u2018tapering\u2019 the illumination at\nthe edges of the antenna, it is possible to achieve lower sidelobe levels as well as\nreduced \u2018spillover\u2019 of radiation from the primary feed. The consequent slight increase\nin beamwidth and decrease in gain (see below) is often a price worth paying.\n\nAntenna gain\n\nThe importance of using highly directional antennas is that they provide signal power gain\nas compared with the same system using (hypothetical) isotropic antennas. The relevant\nexpressions for gain are given by\n\ndirective gain = actual power flux density\npower flux density from an isotropic\n\nradiator with the same total radiated power\n\npower gain = actual power flux density\npower flux density from a loss?free isotropic\n\nradiator with the same input power from the generator\n\nIt is assumed that the flux densities are measured at a fixed large distance from the antenna.\nThe power gain is slightly less than the directive gain because of the power dissipated in\nlosses in the antenna.\n\nFor a uniformly illuminated antenna with physical area A, the directive gain at the\ncentre of the main beam is given by\n\nG = 4?A/?2 (12.14)\n\nWe may use the same relation to define an effective aperture Ae for any antenna. Thus,\n\nAe = ?2G/4? (12.15)\n\nNon-uniform illumination results in the effective aperture being less than the physical\narea. We may define an aperture efficiency by\n\n? = Ae/A (12.16)\n\nFor typical microwave antennas ? is in the range 0.5\u20130.7. An overall antenna efficiency\nmay be defined in the same way by using the power gain in place of the directive gain.\n\nIn a satellite system, where the coverage area is specified, the optimum antenna size\ndepends on a trade-off between antenna gain and beamwidth. In order to optimize per-\nformance at the edge of coverage (which is usually the critical requirement in the system\ndesign), the gain in this direction should normally be about 4.2 dB less than at beam centre.\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 419\n\nPolarization axial ratio\n\nMost antennas are designed either for pure circular or for plane polarization, but in practice\nthe radiation is always elliptically polarized. In either case the antenna quality, from this\npoint of view, can be expressed as an axial ratio. This is defined as the ratio (dB) of the\npowers radiated in two orthogonal planes of polarization, in which the planes are chosen\nto maximize the ratio.\n\nFor circular polarization, the axial ratio should ideally be 0 dB. In a ground-station\nantenna, which points directly at the satellite, 1 dB should be achievable, but for an antenna\non-board a satellite the axial ratio may be as high as 2\u20133 dB at the edge of coverage.\n\nBecause the transmitting and receiving antennas may not have their planes of maximum\ngain aligned, allowance must be made for possible polarization loss .\n\nIn the case of a plane-polarized antenna, the axial ratio should be as large as possible\nin order to discriminate against signals that may be present on the other polarization. An\naxial ratio (or cross-polar discrimination: XPD , as it is usually called in this case) as high\nas 30 dB is not unreasonable.\n\n12.2.9 Frequency reuse\n\nIt has already been pointed out that overcrowding of the spectrum has led to a gradual\nshift towards higher frequencies. However, since higher frequency usually means less\ntransmitter power and increased atmospheric loss, there are considerable advantages in\nmaking maximum use of the lower-frequency bands. Many satellites now use the same\nfrequency for two or more signals. This may be achieved either by spatial discrimination,\nin which two signals at the same frequency may be transmitted on separate narrow beams\nto different regions on the Earth\u2019s surface, or by polarization discrimination, in which\nsignals at the same frequency may be transmitted over the same path on orthogonal\npolarizations. In the former case, spot beam frequency reuse is similar to the frequency\nreuse of cellular radio towers. In the latter case, antenna imperfections and atmospheric\nphenomena may give rise to cross-polar interference. Although this can be troublesome,\nspecial receivers can use the signal in one channel to \u2018null out\u2019 the unwanted signal in\nthe other, thus making the technique viable. The saving of space in the radio spectrum\ncan be considerable.\n\n12.2.10 The link budget\n\nWe are now in a position to discuss the calculation of the transmitter power requirement.\nWe have seen that, for a given type of modulation, the overall performance depends upon\nthe RF carrier-to-noise-power-density ratio, C /N0, at the receiver. It remains to show how\nC /N0 is related to the transmitter power.\n\nThe definition of antenna gain implies that a transmitter with output power PT associated\nwith an antenna of gain GT can be replaced, for the purpose of this calculation, by an\nisotropic radiator with output power PTGT. The quantity PTGT is known as the equivalent\nisotropic radiated power (EIRP). From an isotropic radiator, this power would spread out\n\n\n\n420 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nuniformly so that the PFD (i.e. the power flowing through a unit area) at a distance r\nfrom the source is\n\nS = PTGT/(4?r2) (12.17)\n\nIf atmospheric attenuation results in power loss by a factor LA, then the flux density at\nthe receiver is\n\nS = PTGT/(4?r2LA) (12.18)\n\nThe effective area of a receiving antenna with gain GR is\n\nAR = ?2GR/4? (12.19)\n\nThus the signal power at the input to the receiver is\n\nC = PTGTGR(?/4?r)2(1/LA) (12.20)\n\nFinally for a system temperature Tsys the noise power density referred to the receiver\ninput is kT sys, giving a signal-to-noise-power-density ratio of\n\nC /N0 = PTGT(?/4?r)2(1/LA)(GR/Tsys)(1/k) (12.21)\n\nIn this expression, which is known as the telecommunications link budget equation ,\nthe factor PTGT can be regarded as a figure of merit for the transmitter and the term\nGR/Tsys as a figure of merit for the receiving system. Leaving aside the constant 1/k , the\nremaining factors refer to the propagation path. The quantity\n\nLS = (4?r/?)2 (12.22)\n\nis known as the free-space loss . We may think of it as the attenuation between two\nisotropic antennas separated by a distance r . It may seem curious that the space loss\nshould depend on frequency but this is an artefact of the (slightly arbitrary) way in which\nwe have separated out the factors related to the transmitter and to the receiver.\n\nFor a satellite in geostationary orbit (for which r is 3.6 \u00d7 107 m), the space loss from\nthe transmitter to the sub-satellite point is given in decibels by\n\nLS(dB) = 183.6 + 20 log10 f (GHz) (12.23)\n\nIf the ground station is not at the sub-satellite point, the increased path length results\nin additional space loss, depending on the elevation of the satellite as viewed from the\nground station.\n\nIn terms of the space loss, C /N0 is given by\n\nC /N0 = PTGT(1/LS)(1/LA)(GR/Tsys)(1/k) (12.24)\n\nSince the required C /N0 can be determined from the system specification, this expression\nallows us to calculate the required transmitter power, PT. A typical link budget is shown\n\n\n\nTECHNIQUES OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS 12.2 421\n\nTable 12.1 Example of a link budget1\n\nTransmitter output power (per carrier) ?14.4 dBW\nMultiple carrier loss2,3 0.2 dB\nTransmitting circuit loss2 0.9 dB\nTransmitted carrier power ?15.5 dBW\nTransmitting antenna gain 18.0 dBi\nEIRP 2.5 dBW\nSpace loss2,4 206.1 dB\nPolarization loss2,5 0.1 dB\nAtmospheric and multi-path losses2,4 4.0 dB\nTotal transmission loss2,4 210.2 dB\nGround terminal G/T 35.0 dBi/K\nBoltzmann\u2019s constant ?228.6 dBJ/K\nReceived C/N0 55.9 dBHz\nTransmitted C/N06 69.2 dBHz\nResultant C/N07 55.7 dBHz\nCarrier-to-intermod-density ratio, C/I08 67.0 dBHz\nOverall C/N0 (including intermods) 55.4 dBHz\nRequired C/N09 55.3 dBHz\nMargin 0.1 dB\n\n1On the basis of the shore-to-shore link in a study of a maritime satellite system.

For instance, a power of 1 W is 0 dBW (decibels relative to one watt) or 30 dBm (dB\nrelative to one milliwatt), a bandwidth of 1 MHz is 60 dBHz (decibels relative to one Hz)\nand Boltzmann\u2019s constant is ?228.6 dB J/K (decibels relative to one Joule per Kelvin).\nNote also that C /N0, being power/(power per Hz), has the dimensions of frequency and\nmay properly be expressed as dBHz.\n\n\n\n422 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n12.3 THE COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOAD\n\n12.3.1 The transponder system\n\nFigure 12.12 is a simplified block diagram of a typical satellite repeater, which together\nwith its associated antenna subsystem would make up a complete on-board transponder.\nDepending on the purpose of the satellite, there may be just one or perhaps many such\nrepeaters within the same payload.\n\nBefore considering any of the details of the units, we shall trace the signal\u2019s path through\nthe transponder, listing the main subsystems that it encounters and outlining their func-\ntions. The scheme adopted is a dual-conversion payload. Some alternative arrangements\nwill be mentioned later.\n\nThe signal path\n\n1. The antenna subsystem\u2019s function is to collect the incident signal power. Clearly the\nmain requirements are that the aperture should be of sufficient size to receive a signal\nof adequate strength, and that it should be pointed in the right direction (an obvious\nneed but this is often the source of many non-trivial problems in implementation). In\na system relying on frequency reuse, the antenna subsystem must distinguish between\nsignals on the basis of direction of arrival and polarization. Different signals on the\nsame frequency must be presented at different output ports.\n\n2. The low-noise amplifier (LNA) must amplify the weak signals arriving at the antenna\nto a level at which they can be processed without causing degradation of signal\nquality by noise in the electronic circuits. In addition, the LNA usually incorporates\nsome preliminary filtering with the main purpose of attenuating any strong signals\nthat may be present at adjacent frequencies.\n\n3. The down-converter converts the signals to a lower frequency (the intermediate\nfrequency, IF ) at which much of the amplification takes place. This enables the\ncreation of narrow-band channels that are suitable for many types of communication\nand may be essential for the implementation of on-board routing and processing\nfunctions. Frequency conversion also effectively eliminates the possibility of the\namplifiers breaking into oscillation because of coupling between the output and the\ninput of the repeater. The down-converter includes filters at both its input and its\noutput. In Figure 12.1 the input filter is shown as part of the LNA. Its purpose is\nto give a more sharply defined RF passband and to reject the \u2018image channel\u2019 (see\nSection 12.3.5). The output filter rejects the many unwanted frequencies that are\ngenerated in the process of down-conversion, in favour of the one wanted at the IF.\n\n4. The IF processor . The first part of the processor is normally a demultiplexer or set\nof filters that divide the broadband output from the down-converter into a number\nof separate channels. Although the proliferation of equipments in a multi-channel\ntransponder carries a penalty in mass and cost, it also has advantages such as a\nreduction in IM products (see below) in the high-power stages, greater flexibility in\nrouting signals between different antenna beams and different frequency bands, and\nthe provision of graceful degradation of the system (meaning a gradual reduction\nin performance as equipment failures occur, rather than a sudden and total loss\nof capacity).\n\n\n\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOAD 12.3 423\n\nSpare freq.\ngenerator\n\nFrequency\ngenerator\n\nMaster\noscillator\n\nSpare master\noscillator\n\nS\nw\ni\nt\nc\nh\ni\nn\ng\n\nLow-noise amplifier Down converter\n\nCoupler Coupler\n\nDemultiplexer Level\nadjusters\n\nUp converters\n\nConnections to\nand from other\ntransponders\n\nTransmitters\n\nM\nu\nl\nt\ni\np\nl\ne\nx\ne\nr\n\nm\na\nt\nr\ni\nx\n\nFigure 12.12 A simple on-board repeater\n\nThe second part of the processor is a switching matrix to perform routing operations\nand, in the case of equipment failures, to select channels that are still working.\nFinally there are the IF amplifiers, one for each channel, that provide most of the\ntransponder power gain.\n\n5. The up-converter reverses the function of the down-converter by translating the\namplified IF signals to the higher frequency at which they will be transmitted. Like\nthe down-converter, it produces many unwanted outputs as well as the one at the\nright frequency. There is consequently a need for further filtering before the signals\npass on to the final amplifiers.\n\n\n\n424 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n6. The transmitters (or high-power amplifiers, HPAs) raise the signal power to the\nrequired output level. The power amplifiers must achieve this with the maximum\nefficiency (minimum drain on primary satellite power) consistent with acceptable\ndistortion. In a channelized system, the signals must then pass to a multiplexer\nthat re-combines the signal bands to form a single output band. There will then be\nsome filtering to remove the harmonics and other unwanted out-of-band signals that\nare always generated in a non-linear power amplifier. If the same antenna is used\nfor both transmitting and receiving, the transmitter output filter and the receiver\ninput filter may be combined in a single unit, the duplexer , which has the added\nfunction of ensuring that the incoming and outgoing signals are routed to their\ncorrect destinations.\n\nOther payload units\n\nThere are several other units that form part of the communications payload but are not\ndirectly on the signal path. There is the local oscillator that provides continuous sine\nwave (CW) signals used by the down- and up-converters in order to provide the required\nfrequency shifts. Typically the unit would provide several (perhaps many) outputs, one\nfor each frequency converter. Possibly some or all of these will need to be harmonically\nrelated. Even where it is not a system requirement, it is usually good practice to derive\nall the required frequencies from a single master oscillator.\n\nIn order to achieve stable gain and frequencies, highly regulated power supplies are\nneeded. Some power conditioning may be provided in the service module but further\nregulation is normally provided by units within the payload. In particular, where special-\nized power conditioning is needed, as for instance, for a travelling wave tube (TWT) or\nsolid-state power amplifier (SSPA), there will be a dedicated unit for each equipment.\n\nFinally the communications payload may include part of the Tracking, Telemetry and\nCommand (TT&C) equipment. In many cases, once the satellite is on station, the telemetry\nand telecommand signals are transmitted at frequencies within the communications bands.\nThe telecommand signals are extracted at the input demultiplexer or the IF processor and\nmay be further down-converted or partially demodulated for the interface with the TT&C\nsubsystem. Similarly, the telemetry signals are injected into the communications downlink\neither in the IF processor or in the output multiplexer. During the launch and early orbit\nphase (i.e. prior to switching on the communications equipment) and also as a back-up\nwhile on station, the TT&C system uses a dedicated transponder operating at one of the\nstandard space operations frequencies. This is normally part of the satellite bus.\n\nOther types of transponder\n\nA few years ago, the dual-conversion repeater was in most cases the cheapest and most\neffective way of providing the necessary transponder gain and implementing on-board\nrouting and processing. However, there is a useful reduction in complexity if the upcon-\nverter is eliminated, leaving a single conversion from the receive frequency to the transmit\nfrequency. The bulk of the amplification and the other functions of the IF processor must\nin that case be performed at one of the radio frequencies (usually the downlink frequency,\n\n\n\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOAD 12.3 425\n\nsince this is normally lower). For frequencies of Ka-band and above the dual-conversion\nrepeater can still be found.\n\nThe system described above is known as a transparent repeater. An alternative scheme\nis on-board demodulation of the signals followed by modulation of a separate downlink\ncarrier. This arrangement is known as a regenerative transponder. Its use can lead to an\nimprovement in SNR in digital systems where uplink noise is significant. This might be\nthe case, for instance, if very small ground stations are in use so that uplink power is\nlimited. In a regenerative transponder, digital signals can be \u2018cleaned up\u2019 at baseband so\nthat only those noise peaks that are large enough to cause bit errors will be transferred to\nthe output. Since the BER is normally very sensitive to the SNR, there is an advantage in\na system where error rates rather than noise powers are cumulative. A further advantage\nof a regenerative transponder is that it allows sophisticated signal processing at baseband.\nIn addition to routing on an individual signal basis this may include, for instance, changes\nin the coding structure and adaptation of error correcting codes in response to changing\nsignal transmission conditions.\n\nThe use of redundancy\n\nAs is usual in all payload systems, the communications payload includes cold spares\nof the most critical units. The redundancy inherent in a channelized system has already\nbeen mentioned as a source of graceful degradation. Units that are common to all or\nmany of the signal paths, such as (in the payload illustrated in Figure 12.12) the LNAs,\ndown-converters and local oscillators, are usually provided with one or more spares,\nbut where there are several parallel signal paths a lower proportion of spares may be\nappropriate. Wherever possible the spares are connected into the repeater using passive\npower splitters and combiners or hybrid couplers so that the selection of the operating\nunit can be effected simply by switching the power supplies on or off. The use of passive\ncomponents rather than RF switches leads to greater reliability. However, since the use of\nany of these components involves some loss of signal (in the case of a power splitter or\nhybrid coupler, at least 3 dB loss) they cannot be used at the input to the receiver where\nthe noise level is critical or at the output of the HPAs where the loss of transmitter power\ncannot be tolerated. In these positions low-loss switches must be used.\n\nMass and power budgets\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the payload system design, and a determining\nfactor in the choice of payload architecture, is the estimation of the total mass and the\npower requirements. The way these quantities are apportioned between equipments shows\nsubstantial variations from one payload to another. The illustrative budgets shown in\nTables 12.2 and 12.3 should not therefore be considered of general application. They are,\nhowever, broadly representative of fairly large satellites providing a mix of fixed-satellite\nand direct broadcast services.\n\nThe budgets given in the tables are for a 20-channel single down-conversion payload\nproviding regional coverage. Differences between the numbers of equipments assumed\nin the mass budgets and those used for calculating power are due to the inclusion of\nredundant spares. The power budget shows the maximum demand when all 20 channels\nare driven at their highest power level. Particularly striking is the dominant role of the\n\n\n\n426 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nTable 12.2 Example of a spacecraft power budget\n\nQuantity Consumption (W) Dissipation (W)\n\nEquipment Total\n\nReceivers (LNAs, down-converters,\nlocal oscillators)\n\n2 20 20 20\n\nChannel amplifiers 20 70 70 70\nTWTs 20 3310 3310 1250\nPower conditioning units (for channel\n\namplifiers and TWTs)\n20 3710 330 330\n\nTotal payload consumption 3730\nSpacecraft bus DC power (equinox) 340\nLosses/battery charge (equinox) 670\n\nDemand at power source 4740\n\nTable 12.3 Example of a spacecraft mass budget\n\nQuantity Total (kg)\n\nReceivers (LNAs, down-converters, local\noscillators)\n\n4 8.5\n\nDemultiplexers 4 16.0\nSwitch matrix 2 11.0\nChannel amplifiers 28 8.5\nTWTAs (including isolators, output\n\nswitches etc.)\n28 85.0\n\nMultiplexer 2 9.0\nRF cables/waveguides \u2014 10.0\nDC harness \u2014 10.0\nFixing/mounting plates etc. \u2014 7.0\n\nTotal repeater mass 165.0\nAntenna subsystem 60\n\nTotal payload mass 225\nStructure/propulsion 290\nThermal control 60\nAttitude determination and control 50\nTelemetry, telecommand, ranging 50\nSolar array 125\nBatteries 180\nPower conditioning and harness 80\nBalance 3\n\nTotal platform mass 838\n\nSpacecraft dry mass 1063\n\nNote: TWTA.

Thus in calculating other key aspects of performance (such as EIRP and\nG/T) the coverage area and gain are usually regarded as predetermined parameters. Since\nperformance requirements usually apply to the worst case, it is normally the antenna gain\nat the edge of the service area that is critical.\n\nG/T\n\nFor a given antenna gain, improvement in G/T can be achieved only by reducing the\nsystem noise temperature, Tsys. The main contributions to Tsys are noise from the first\namplifier stage and antenna noise due to thermal radiation from the Earth. Assuming that\na \u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 amplifier device is used, there is little that can be done to reduce these\ncontributions. Other contributions more amenable to the control of the designer come\nfrom later stages in the repeater, from noise generated in the transmitter which is not\nfully removed by the output filter and from the receiver input losses.\n\nInput losses include attenuation in the antenna cable or waveguide, loss in the input\nfilter, loss in a test coupler (where fitted) and mismatch losses. In designing the layout of\nthe spacecraft, the LNAs should generally be placed as close as possible to the antennas\nin order to minimize cable losses. Filter loss depends on the filtering requirements and on\nthe type of construction (see Section 12.3.8). Mismatch losses are caused by reflection of\nsignal power at interfaces between equipments whose electrical impedance differs slightly\nfrom the correct design value. Reflections from a single interface can usually be kept as\nlow as 1 or 2% of the power but the combination of several interfaces can result in a\nsmall but not negligible loss.\n\nIf the LNA has sufficient gain, the contribution to the overall system noise temperature\nfrom later stages can be made small. Despite this, however, the IF processor can still\nsometimes make a significant contribution. This is because the first IF amplifier is often\npreceded by power splitters, mixers and filters, which introduce attenuation and so undo\nsome of the effect of the high gain LNA.\n\nDetailed calculations of the system noise temperature are used to demonstrate\ncompliance with the G/T requirement and to apportion the required gain between the\nvarious equipments.\n\n12.3.3 The antenna subsystem\n\nThe antenna subsystem is often a critical factor in the spacecraft design because of its\nimpact on total mass and stability, the possible need for stowage during launch and\ndeployment in orbit and the requirement for Earth pointing, if necessary by the provision\n\n\n\n428 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nTable 12.4 Spacecraft antenna diameters from geostationary orbit\n\nEarth coverage UK coverage\n\nBeamwidth 17? 1.5?\nGain (at edge of coverage) 18.5 dBi 39.8 dBi\n\nDiameter (m)\nFrequency\n1.5 GHz (L-band) 1.0 11.0\n4.0 GHz (C-band) 0.37 4.1\n12.5 GHz (ku-band) 0.11 1.3\n\nof a de-spun platform. From the point of view of communications, the first constraint on\nantenna design is the required coverage area that determines the beamwidth and hence\nthe antenna size (Section 12.2.8). Table 12.4 gives antenna diameters for three down-\nlink frequencies and for two extremes of service area: Earth coverage, corresponding to\nbeamwidth of 17\n\n?\nfrom GEO and a (directive) gain of 18.5 dBi (at the edge of coverage),\n\nand a spot beam covering, say, the British Isles, with a beamwidth of about 1.5\n?\n\nand an\nedge-of-coverage gain of 40 dBi. It is seen that for large coverage areas (comparable with\nEarth coverage) and especially at the higher frequencies, antennas of quite modest size\nare sufficient.\n\nThere are several possible advantages in the use of spot beams:\n\n\u2022 There may be a requirement for a strictly limited coverage area in order, for instance,\nto avoid interference with other services.\n\n\u2022 High antenna gain may be needed in order to serve very small ground terminals. The\ncoverage area may in this case be served by many spot beams.\n\n\u2022 More efficient use can be made of the available transmitter power if areas of high\ntraffic density are served by high gain antennas (requiring relatively little transmitter\npower per carrier).\n\n\u2022 Spot beams may enable frequency reuse by spatial discrimination.\nThe trade-off to decide on the number and size of the spot beams is clearly very com-\n\nplicated and involves many different aspects of the overall system design\u2014the spacecraft\nstructural design, antenna deployment, attitude control, power supplies, thermal control,\nand so on, as well as telecommunications capacity and market prediction.\n\nAntenna types\n\n1. The horn antenna can readily provide the small aperture needed for Earth coverage\nat 4 GHz or higher frequencies. In its simplest form it is a section of rectangular\nor circular waveguide spread outwards at the end to give the required aperture\ndimension (Figure 12.13a). In order to give improved radiation patterns, this simple\nstructure is often modified by, for instance, the inclusion of steps or corrugations in\nthe flared section.\n\n2. Patch antennas (Figure 12.13b) consist mainly of a conductor mounted on a dielec-\ntric over a ground plane. Their use is generally limited to rather wide beams and\ngains less than about 14 dB. They can be used in phase arrays to provide a directive\n\n\n\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOAD 12.3 429\n\nradiation pattern that can be scanned and altered by changing the relative phases of\nthe feed signals.\n\n3. Reflectors , such as a paraboloid illuminated by a horn, are usually the most satisfac-\ntory solution when a narrow beam is required. The most usual configurations are the\nfront-fed arrangement where a waveguide runs through or round the reflector to the\nfocus of the paraboloid (Figure 12.13c), and the offset feed in which the reflector\nis a segment of a paraboloid taken from one side of the axis (Figure 12.13d). The\nfront-fed arrangement has the disadvantage that the feed and its support structure\ncause blockage of the beam, reducing the gain and scattering power into the side-\nlobes. Moreover, the offset arrangement is often mechanically better, since the feed\nhorn can be mounted rigidly on a face of the spacecraft. On the other hand its lack of\nsymmetry results in poorer XPD when linear polarization is used, and in the case of\ncircular polarization it can cause beams of opposite polarizations to point in slightly\ndifferent directions. The Cassegrain system (Figure 12.13e), which is common on\nground stations, is not often used on satellites because blockage by the sub-reflector\nusually makes it unsatisfactory for a small antenna. In some cases, where the service\nregion is irregular in shape, there may be an advantage in forming an appropriately\n\u2018shaped beam\u2019 which, in a reflector antenna, is achieved by replacing the single\nprimary feed by a cluster of horns. The reflector must be large enough to form the\nsmallest features of the beam pattern.\n\n4. Phased arrays are based upon the principle illustrated in Figure 12.14. The aperture\nis excited by many separate radiating elements that individually have only very\nweakly directive properties. Their combination may, however, have a very narrow\nbeam because the radiation in some directions interferes constructively and in others\ndestructively. The figure shows a one-dimensional array but the principle can readily\nbe extended to the two-dimensional case.\n\nThe advantages of this arrangement are that one array can produce a large number\nof beams simultaneously and that these can be steered electronically over a rather\nlarge angular range without the need for mechanical pointing systems. The distribu-\ntion of transmitter power between many output paths reduces the demand on any one\npower amplifier and facilitates the use of solid-state devices. Finally, the array can\nbe mounted rigidly and can often be made to conform to some convenient surface.\n\nThe major disadvantage is the complexity of the associated equipment. Each of\nthe equipment in a signal path to or from an array element must have a precisely\ncontrolled phase and amplitude characteristic and this must be maintained over a\nwide range of temperature, signal level, and so on. Since the number of elements\nmay be large (possibly 100 or more) the programmes for manufacture, alignment\nand testing can be considerable.\n\n12.3.4 The low-noise amplifier (LNA)\n\nThe primary requirements for the LNA are a low-noise temperature and sufficient gain\nto ensure that the noise contributions from the succeeding stages are small. A variety of\namplifier types have been used in the past, including travelling wave tubes (TWT), tunnel\ndiodes, parametric amplifiers and transistors.\n\n\n\n430 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(c) (d)\n\n(e)\n\nFigure 12.13 Antenna types: (a) horns; (b) patch antenna; (c), (d), (e) paraboloidal\nreflector antennas; (c) front-fed; (d) offset feed and (e) Cassegrain\n\n\n\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOAD 12.3 431\n\nPhase\nshifters\n\nf1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6\n\nq\n\n2\nl\n\nFigure 12.14 Phased array antenna. If all of the phase-shifts, ?1, ?2, . . . are equal, there\nis constructive interference in the broadside direction. At a small angle ? from this there\nis no emission since radiation from each element interferes destructively with that from\nan element three spacings away (for the six element array shown here). By changing\nthe ?i , the beam can be steered electronically without any movement of the antenna\n\nIn most current designs a transistor amplifier is chosen for the \u2018front-end\u2019. In the first\nstage of amplification, in which the highest possible performance is required, an individual\ntransistor would normally be used. For the later, generally less critical stages, monolithic\nmicrowave integrated circuits (MMICs) are widely used. These have an advantage both\nin reduced size and mass and in improved reliability and reproducibility.\n\nTo minimize input losses, the LNAs are accommodated as close as possible to the\nreceiver antenna feeds. Cooling the LNAs in order to decrease their noise figure is likely\nto become increasingly common.\n\nOne further requirement for the LNA is good linearity over a wide dynamic range.\nSince the amplifier handles a multi-carrier signal (it is placed ahead of the demultiplexer\nthat separates the signals into channels) any departure from linearity can give rise to IM\nproducts which cannot be removed by subsequent filtering.\n\n12.3.5 Frequency converters\n\nAny non-linear device will, in principle, serve as a frequency converter or mixer since,\nin response to an input containing frequencies f1 and f2, the output will contain every fre-\nquency of the form nf1 \u00b1 mf2 (see Section 12.3.2). Usually the required output frequency\nis f1 + f2 or f1 ? f2. Most conventional mixers depend on resistive diodes and these are\nusually arranged in a symmetric configuration, either singly or doubly balanced, which\nsuppresses some of the unwanted outputs and provides better isolation between ports. In\n\n\n\n432 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\na balanced mixer the signal is applied at one point in the circuit and the local oscillator\nat another, ideally isolated, port.\n\nBest performance is achieved when the local oscillator waveform is at a much higher\nlevel than the signal, so that the signal is in effect switched on and off at the local\noscillator frequency, fLO. As a general rule the local oscillator level should be at least\n10 dB above the maximum signal level in order to minimize the conversion loss (the\nreduction in signal level from input frequency to output frequency), and to keep the level\nof IM products as low as possible.\n\nA mixer produces many output frequencies in addition to the wanted one. It is also\nsensitive to frequencies other than the expected input frequency. In particular, in a down-\nconverter, if the input frequency is (fLO + fIF), then the mixer also responds to (fLO ? fIF),\nwhich is down-converted to the same IF (and vice versa). This is known as the image\nresponse of the down-converter. Noise and interfering signals in the image channel must\nbe filtered out prior to down-conversion.\n\nThe noise temperature of a mixer is closely related to the conversion loss. To a rea-\nsonable approximation, a down-converter can be regarded as an IF amplifier fed through\na resistive attenuator. Semiconductor noise generated by the diodes can usually be made\nrelatively insignificant. Thus the noise figure of the down-converter (in decibels) is given\nroughly by the sum of the IF amplifier noise figure and the conversion loss. Noise figures\nin the region of 2 dB are possible for mixers operating at 14.5 GHz.\n\n12.3.6 Local oscillators\n\nApart from the frequencies and signal levels, the two most significant aspects of a local\noscillator\u2019s performance are the frequency stability and the phase noise. The specification\nof long-term stability usually limits the frequency drift to less than about 1 ppm/year,\nand this requires a crystal controlled source. Since crystal oscillators operate at less than\nabout 150 MHz, frequency multiplication is necessary. A non-linear device such as a\nvaractor diode or step-recovery diode may be used to generate harmonics, the appro-\npriate microwave frequency being extracted either by filtering or by phase-locking a\nhigh-frequency oscillator to the correct harmonic.\n\n12.3.7 IF processors\n\nDigital signal processing (DSP) enables a number of payload functions to be performed\nincluding signal modulation/demodulation, channelization, channel power control, TWTA\nlinearization, antenna control and autonomous packet switching. This results in a flexible\napproach to the service provision to be employed, a key requirement in the digital era,\nin which Internet access and digital audio and video transmissions are likely to vie for\nsatellite resources.\n\nWhere DSP payloads are not employed, the main functions of the IF processor are to\nprovide most of the transponder gain, to define the frequency response of each channel\nand, where necessary, to perform beam-to-beam routing functions. Thus the principal\ncomponents are filters, transistor amplifiers and possibly electronic switching circuits.\nWhere the routing requirements call for the division of the spectrum into many narrow-\nband channels, a rather low IF would be chosen. At IFs less than about 200 MHz, the best\n\n\n\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOAD 12.3 433\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nLo\nss\n\n (\ndB\n\n)\n\nFrequency\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n\nFigure 12.15 Filter types: (a) low-pass; (b) high-pass; (c) band-pass and (d) band-stop\n\nchoice of filter in terms of bandwidth, frequency stability and weight is almost always\nsome type of crystal or surface acoustic wave (SAW) device. For broader channels and at\nhigher frequencies, helical resonators provide satisfactory performance while at frequen-\ncies above 2 GHz, metal rod (coaxial) resonators or a thin-film technique would probably\nbe used (this is a method of forming microwave circuits by etching a metal film deposited\non a substrate of high dielectric constant).\n\n12.3.8 Filters\n\nThe need for RF filters at various points in the transponder has already been noted. Most\nof these can be described by one of the labels, \u2018low-pass\u2019, \u2018high-pass\u2019, \u2018band-pass\u2019 or\n\u2018band-stop\u2019 (see Figure 12.15).\n\nA typical RF filter consists of a series of resonant elements (or reactive elements for\nlow- and high-pass filters) with precisely controlled electrical coupling between them.\nThe most important electrical characteristics are:\n\n\u2022 the attenuation within the passband,\n\u2022 the rate of roll-off (increase of attenuation with frequency outside the passband),\n\u2022 the flatness (lack of amplitude variation) of the in-band response,\n\u2022 the phase linearity or group delay characteristic.\n\nSome of the more important RF filters in the transponder are listed below.\n\n\u2022 The input filter. A band-pass filter with main requirements: low in-band loss with\nadequate attenuation out of band.\n\n\u2022 The channel filter. A band-pass filter with main requirements: rapid roll-off together\nwith moderate loss and a sufficiently flat in-band amplitude and group delay response.\n\n\u2022 The output (harmonic) filter.A low-pass or band-pass filter with main requirements:\nlow in-band loss with adequate attenuation at specified higher frequencies.\n\n\u2022 The multiplexers and demultiplexer. In general these can be regarded as combinations\nof band-pass and band-stop filters. There may be a requirement for very rapid roll-off\nif the channels are closely spaced. The multiplexer, coming after the HPA, must have\nlow in-band loss but this requirement is usually less stringent for the demultiplexer.\n\n\n\n434 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\nThere is much in common in the procedures for the design of the various types of\nfilter. Any of the types shown in Figure 12.15 can be synthesized initially as a low-pass\ndesign, followed where necessary by the application of standard rules to transpose the\nimpedances to those required for a high-pass or band-pass characteristic.\n\nStandard response curves and tabulations of component values are available for low-\npass prototype filters optimized according to various requirements. Two commonly used\ncriteria are maximally flat in-band response (Butterworth filter), and maximum roll-off\nfor a given in-band amplitude variation (Chebyshev filter). These characteristics can be\nobtained by including coupling only between adjacent filter sections. If coupling between\nnon-adjacent sections is allowed, other responses are possible of which the most important\nis the elliptic filter response. This has a very sharp roll-off to attenuation maxima just\noutside the passband.\n\nThe theoretical response curves can be used to determine the number of sections\n(resonators) needed to achieve the required roll-off while maintaining adequate flatness\nin-band. It is then possible to predict other filter properties such as group delay response\nand in-band attenuation.\n\nIn designing a microwave filter for a space application, it is important to allow adequate\nmargins for temperature variations. The main effect is a shift of centre frequency that for\naluminium filters may be as much as 1 part in 103 over a 50?C temperature range. For\nInvar construction the corresponding variation is about 1 in 104 but there is a significant\nmass penalty. Alternatively the filter design may incorporate temperature compensation\nbased on the use of two materials with different coefficients of expansion. Many filters\nare now made of carbon fibre based materials. These have both low mass and low thermal\nexpansion but their use in some applications is limited by difficulties in manufacture.\n\n12.3.9 Transmitters\n\nThere are only two generally accepted means of amplifying the signals to the level required\nfor downlink transmission. These are the TWT and power transistors. The TWT has been\nthe most commonly used but as transistor technology improves, solid-state amplifiers are\nfinding an increasing number of applications, mainly because of their higher reliability\nand lower mass.\n\nTravelling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA)\n\nIn a TWT, amplification is achieved by interaction between an electron beam and a signal\nin the form of an electromagnetic field travelling along an elongated guiding structure. For\na significant effect, the electrons and the signal must travel at almost the same velocity,\nwhich implies that the signal must be slowed down very considerably by the guiding\nstructure. In low- and medium-power tubes the \u2018slow-wave structure\u2019 is a helix of wire\nheld in place by ceramic rods. The signal modulates the density of the beam and the\nbeam in turn transfers energy to the signal, which increases exponentially in amplitude as\nit travels along the tube to the output port. Helix tubes are capable of up to about 200 W\noutput. For higher powers a more robust slow-wave structure may be required, such as\na series of electrically coupled cavities. However, for most space applications, including\ndirect broadcast television, a helix tube is preferred.\n\n\n\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOAD 12.3 435\n\nR.F. input R.F. output\n\nElectron gun Collector\n\nCollector \n?1950 V\n\nChassis\n0 V\n\nSlow wave structure\n\nAnode + 100 V\n\nCathode ?3300 VHeater \n5.2 V\n\n28 V\nbus\n\nOn/off\ncontrol\n\nR.F. switch\ncontrols\n\nTelemetry\n\nPower supply\n\nFigure 12.16 Simplified TWTA configuration\n\nA disadvantage of a TWTA is the requirement for a complicated high-voltage power\nsupply (see Figure 12.16). The accelerating voltage is several kilovolts and must be very\nwell regulated. The efficiency of a TWTA can be high\u2014as much as 70% for the tube\nitself or about 60\u201365% including the power supplies.\n\nTWTs can now be made sufficiently reliable for most missions but they do suffer from a\ngradual deterioration in performance due to loss of cathode emission during their lifetime.\nIn some cases a facility is provided for a telecommandable increase in heater current in\norder to restore performance. Alternatively, the correct cathode current may be maintained\nby a control loop that varies the anode or control grid voltage.\n\nThough attractive from the point of view of gain, efficiency and power output, a TWT\nis a rather non-linear amplifier. When amplifying a multi-carrier signal, it both generates\nIM products and converts signal amplitude variations into spurious phase modulation.\nMore linear operation can be achieved by \u2018backing-off\u2019 the tube to a lower power level,\nbut this also results in a loss of efficiency.\n\nIt is becoming usual where a multi-carrier operation is required to incorporate a lin-\nearizer in the TWTA. This is a non-linear driver amplifier that pre-distorts the signal in\nsuch a way that the non-linear TWT characteristic is partially compensated. The tube may\nbe operated closer to its maximum power (saturation) level (keeping the efficiency high)\nwhilst IM product levels remain low.\n\nTransistor power amplifiers\n\nWhen compared with the equivalent TWTA, a SSPA has lower mass, higher reliability and\nlower cost. There is also the significant advantage of eliminating the need for the TWT\u2019s\ncomplicated high-voltage power supply. The simpler, low voltage supply required for an\nSSPA affords a further improvement in mass and reliability. Transistors are, however, at a\n\n\n\n436 TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\ndisadvantage with respect to efficiency. The microwave power at the input to a transistor\nis a significant fraction of the output power, so that in computing the efficiency, the power\nrequirements of the driver stages cannot be ignored. For an L-band (1.5 GHz) transistor\namplifier under a multi-carrier operation, the overall efficiency might be around 30\u201335%,\nappreciably less than for a saturated TWTA. But the efficiency of a TWTA decreases\nrapidly with back-off. If good linearity is required, the transistor amplifier may in some\ncircumstances prove to be more efficient than a TWTA.\n\nThe employment of phased arrays allows the use of distributed power amplifiers, where\neach individual SSPA has a fairly modest output. As in the case of an LNA, the critical\nstages (in this case the output stages) are implemented using individual transistors but,\nin order to reduce size and mass, the pre-amplifier and driver stages and any necessary\ncontrol functions may be realized in MMIC technology.\n\nTWTs continue to improve in performance, reliability, adaptability and cost but there\nis, particularly at low powers, considerable competition from solid state devices. The\noutput per transponder is typically a few watts to a few tens of watts. Powers up to about\n300 W are within the present capabilities of SSPAs at L-band. SSPAs are available in all\nfrequency bands up to Ka-band.\n\n12.4 CONCLUSION\n\nA modern communications satellite is a far cry from the simple transponders of Telstar\nand Early Bird. What seemed in the 1960s, a bold and imaginative step is now a mature\ntechnology and fuels the continuing growth of the multi-billion pound satellite industry.\nTelecommunication satellites have become a key part of everyday life. Nevertheless, it is\na technology that continues to develop both under the stimulus of advances in component\ntechnology and in response to new markets brought about by the digital era. Geostationary\nsatellites continue to increase in power and moves to higher frequencies have led to a\nproliferation of telephony and TV transmissions, mobile and Internet services. Technol-\nogy advances have not been limited to the geostationary satellite. After a period of over\noptimistic estimates of market potential, the use of LEO constellations of satellites to pro-\nvide specialist services has stabilized. However, in terms of non-geostationary satellites,\nit is the navigation services that are, at present, the most successful. A further stimulus\nis expected with the introduction of the European GALILEO system.\n\nAs the service requirements of the twenty-first century citizen continue to evolve,\nthe unique opportunities offered by satellites will ensure that this form of delivery will\ncarry on playing an important role in the provision of telecommunication services for the\nforeseeable future.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the considerable contribution of Howard Smith to this\nchapter.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Clarke, A.

There are\ntransmission (downlink) and reception (uplink) functions to perform, as well as the tasks\nof gathering and processing data ready for transmission, and the processing and routing\nof command data from the ground station. In addition, there will be a transponder for\nranging, and support services for the payload.\n\nThe mission, orbit, type of payload and the selected ground control station(s) play a\nconsiderable part in determining the nature of the design. This is illustrated by study-\ning the Intelsat and Inmarsat series of satellites, in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)\nwith communication payloads; Earth remote sensing satellites such as Envisat, METOP,\nTerraSAR-X and Sentinel , in a near-polar Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with passive and active\nsensors to monitor the Earth; and the International Space Station (ISS), in a non-sun-\nsynchronous LEO.\n\nThe spacecraft/ground station link from GEO can be a continuous direct one, with\nthe spacecraft visible at all times from an appropriate ground station. This allows for a\nrelaxed transmission link compared with that from a non-geosynchronous orbit. Envisat,\nfor example, is visible to its ground station for only a few minutes at each ground pass.\nIt therefore needs on-board data storage and a rapid data-transfer link. The ISS requires\na continuous link, and this can be provided by a two-way link with any ground station\nin sight, and/or by a relay system [Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS)],\nwhich makes the ground link via special-purpose spacecraft in GEO.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.

The Intelsat spacecraft use a\nworldwide Launch Support Network operating in C-band, both during launch and sub-\nsequently. Other spacecraft may use the ESA network operating in S-band for initial\norbits, with control being transferred to a dedicated station operating in Ku-band when it\nis on-station.\n\nThe telemetry downlink must provide the ground control team with information about\nthe functioning of the subsystems in the craft, so that they may detect whether it has its\ncorrect orientation, or whether any fault has developed, and if so, they must be able to\ndiagnose its cause. It may also be the channel for passing information from the payload\nto the ground when the mission is scientific or Earth-observation. When the payload\ncomprises communications equipment, that equipment will serve as an alternative route\nfor the telemetry data, once it is deployed.\n\nThe command uplink must enable the ground controller to change the role of the\nspacecraft, such as to reorientate it, to correct a fault, to operate a mechanism, or for other\nreasons. It must do so in a highly reliable way, giving confirmation that the instructions\nhave been carried out.\n\nThe ranging transponder forms part of the system by which the ground controller\ntracks the spacecraft and determines its orbit.\n\nThe payload may require significant control, data handling, data storage and processing\nfunctions. As spacecraft designs evolve towards autonomous operation, the bus itself may\nalso require extensive data processing and storage functions.\n\n13.2 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\n\nAll spacecraft need most of the functions described in this chapter. However, the physical\ndistribution and implementation vary considerably.\n\n13.2.1 Relationship with other subsystems\n\nThe context of the telemetry, command and data-handling subsystem with respect to the\nother main subsystems is illustrated in Figure 13.1. Whilst it is usual to consider any\nsubsystem under discussion as the centre of the system, in this case it is true, for it is the\ndigital system that spacecraft operators and users \u2018see\u2019 and interact with.\n\nCommands are received via, typically, an S-band link, decoded and placed in a queue\nfor either internal distribution or distribution to the other subsystems. The verification of\neach command is achieved by the feedback of telemetry, usually from each stage in the\ncommand distribution and after the operation of the command. This telemetry is checked\nto verify that all is well at each stage. The operation of all of the other subsystems\nis achieved in this way. Some subsystems are not demanding in terms of processing\nrequirements but are still critical to the mission, for example, deployment. Others are\nvery demanding but not so critical, for example, instruments. Separate downlinks, at X-\nor Ka-band, may be provided for the payload data, particularly when the data rate is\ntoo great for the normal telemetry link. The system protocol interacts with an on-ground\ncommand centre, and sometimes a separate data-collection centre. The system usually\n\n\n\nSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 13.2 441\n\nPower \nSS\n\nCommand \nlink\n\nDeployment\n\nThermal \nSS\n\nData link\n\nPayload/ \ninstrument\n\nTM/TC,\ndata handling \n& processing\n\nData \ncollection\n\nCommand \ncentre\n\nSpace segment\n\nGround \nsegment\n\nAOCS/ \npropulsion\n\nFigure 13.1 System context\n\noperates in a number of different modes\u2014ranging from a basic \u2018safe\u2019 mode, in which\nthe spacecraft is kept alive from a command, thermal and power point of view, up to a\nfully performing platform and payload.\n\n13.2.2 Avionics\n\nThe term Avionics is often loosely used. It can apply just to the electronic part of\nthe Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) subsystem but sometimes it is used\nto cover all of the platform electronics hardware and software, that is, elements for\nthe AOCS, spacecraft-level telemetry/telecommand (TM/TC), data communications, data\nprocessing, data storage and the transponder. In a modest spacecraft, all of the process-\ning for these functions may be in a single on-board computer. In large spacecraft, a\nnumber of distributed and sometimes different processors and devices are used. Avionics\ndoes not usually include the payload electronics such as that required by instruments\nand experiments, or the processor embedded in some communications payloads for RF\nbeam forming.\n\n13.2.3 On-board data-handling functions\n\nThe emphasis on the data-handling functions required varies according to the mission type.\nA typical communications satellite only has requirements for basic telemetry and telecom-\nmand functions in order to maintain the health and position of the platform on which the\npayloads are situated. Communications satellites with signal processing capability may\nneed a little more interaction with the ground.\n\n\n\n442 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\nFor all other mission types, the primary product of the mission is in the data, which\nis sent to the ground via telemetry. These missions also tend to operate in a number\nof modes according to mission phase or data product required, and thus involve more\ninteraction with ground operations. The data-handling systems are therefore more directly\ninvolved with the mission product generation and tend to be more complex than for\ncommunications satellites.\n\nTypical functions that can be required of the on-board data-handling (OBDH) system\ninclude the following:\n\n\u2022 Enabling the flow of housekeeping and science data.\n\u2022 Receiving and distributing commands.\n\u2022 Performing telemetry and telecommand protocols.\n\u2022 Time distribution around the spacecraft\u2014required for synchronization, and the time\n\nstamping of information (datation). This is usually derived from an ultra-stable oscil-\nlator and a mission-specific epoch.\n\n\u2022 Providing data storage.\n\u2022 Executing commands and schedules.\n\u2022 Controlling payloads and subsystems.\n\u2022 Monitoring spacecraft health.\n\u2022 Making autonomous decisions.\n\u2022 Performing data compression.\n\n13.3 TELEMETRY DATA FORMATTING\n\n13.3.1 Classification of data\n\nTelemetry data fall into three basic categories: housekeeping, attitude and payload.\nHousekeeping data , sometimes known as engineering parameter data, needs to be mon-\n\nitored to keep a check on the health and operating status of the on-board equipment. Such\ndata can arise in many forms and some typical examples are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Temperatures of equipment boxes, solar arrays, attitude-control thrusters and plenum\nchambers, parts of the structure and so forth. Thermistors are used to convert temper-\nature into an analogue voltage. For high temperatures, thermocouples are used and\nthe output of a few mV d.c. is amplified to a level suitable for the telemetry encoder.\n\n\u2022 Pressure in fuel tanks, plenum chambers and so forth. Various forms of pressure\ntransducers are used.\n\n\u2022 Voltages and currents of equipment power supplies. The rail voltages are scaled to\na common full-scale range, which is often 0 to +5.12 V. Current monitoring may\ninvolve a variety of circuit techniques.\n\n\u2022 Individual digital bits representing the operational status of equipment, each indicat-\ning that a particular functional mode is either selected or deselected. For proportional\nstatus information, such as amplifier gain settings, a number of bits are grouped\ntogether into words of appropriate length.\n\n\n\nTELEMETRY DATA FORMATTING 13.3 443\n\n\u2022 Redundancy status that furnishes each relevant relay or switch with a set of contacts\nto provide a status bit provides information on whether the \u2018main side\u2019 or the \u2018cold\nredundant side\u2019 of equipment is in use.\n\n\u2022 Deployment of mechanisms , separation from the launcher and so forth. A microswitch\nis fitted in order to provide an appropriate status bit.\n\nOn a modern, large communications satellite there will be several hundred to about\n1000 engineering parameters to be monitored, and the result of every command is usu-\nally checked via the telemetry. The great majority of these will only need sampling at\ninfrequent intervals of typically 30 s to 2 min, so the bandwidth required is quite small.\nA bit rate of a few hundred bits per second is sufficient to transmit the total information.\n\nAttitude data arises from a variety of sensors such as Sun, Earth and star sensors,\ngyroscopes and accelerometers (see Chapter 9). The data can be analogue, digital or a\nmixture of both.\n\nDuring transfer and intermediate orbit phase, the attitude and velocity will change\nrapidly, and frequent sampling is needed, typically from once to four times per second.\nFor GEO operations, a reduced rate may be provided, selected by command.\n\nAlthough only a few channels of attitude information are required, the high sampling\nrate needed during some mission phases may lead to a bandwidth that exceeds that which\ncan be provided conveniently by a standard pulse code modulation (PCM) data system,\nand a separate wideband high rate system may have to be provided.\n\nPayload data is very variable and each case needs to be considered individually. Sci-\nence and Earth-observation missions may generate very large data volumes, for example,\nimagery is typically very data-intensive. Often only a few channels of data are required,\nbut their rates may be as high as many Mbits or Gbits per second. An entirely separate\nhigh-rate system may then have to be provided, such as on Envisat, and data compression\nmay also be used to reduce the rate. Whilst high-rate downlinks can be made available\nfor LEO missions, deep space images may take hours or even days to transmit to Earth.\nThe capacity to acquire such data may be limited by the amount of on-board storage as\nwell as the bandwidth of the communication links.\n\nA communications payload gives rise to many channels of engineering parameter data\nin addition to that generated in the service module. Because of its complexity and the\nlarge amount of redundancy employed, it is likely to demand considerably more channels\nthan the service module.\n\nTypical monitoring requirements of a communications payload are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Temperatures of travelling wave tube amplifiers and other repeater equipment.\n\u2022 Power supply voltages and currents for each of the main equipment.\n\u2022 Operating and redundancy status monitors for the many waveguide and coaxial\n\nswitches.\n\u2022 Analogue power monitors for the signal levels at each main RF equipment interface.\n\u2022 Telemetry monitoring of the digital gain settings telecommanded to the various chan-\n\nnel amplifiers.\n\n13.3.2 Influence of mission phase\n\nThe phases of a mission run from ground testing through the launch phase to the orbit\nphases. In each of these, the telemetry plays a part.\n\n\n\n444 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\nDuring ground testing , there is access to inter-unit connections, and test and diagnostic\nconnectors, in addition to the normal telemetry data. On satellites with an avionics data\nbus, direct access to the bus may be possible. This allows higher data rates for telemetry\nand command, with the benefit of faster ground testing. However, RF links are still used\nfor overall performance testing.\n\nDuring the launch phase, satellite data is usually minimal and is restricted to a few\nhousekeeping parameters such as battery condition, some key temperatures, reaction\ncontrol equipment (RCE) pressures and deployed item status. Payloads are not usually\nswitched on until in orbit and until out-gassing has been completed as necessary, but\nsome telemetry activities may occur at separation. This data is sent down via the\nlaunch vehicle.\n\nThe in-orbit phases include the transfer and intermediate orbit phases of geostationary\nmissions. In these cases, telemetry contact is not continuous unless relay satellites are\nused. Spacecraft operation must be autonomous as far as possible in order to avoid the\nneed for intervention by ground control. For example, majority-voting techniques may be\nused instead of cold redundancy.\n\n13.3.3 Telemetry data encoding\n\nAll the data considered so far arises in three basic forms: analogue, digital bi-level, and\ndigital serial. The data is time-division multiplexed (TDM) into a PCM bit stream, which\nmodulates the downlink RF carrier (see Chapter 12).\n\nThe first step in conditioning analogue data is to scale the data to a common full-\nscale range, usually 0 to +5.12 V. This is done at the source of the data. Frequency\ncomponents greater than half the sampling frequency need to be removed by a low-pass\nfilter to prevent aliasing errors. It is good practice to include a simple low-pass filter in\neach analogue line.\n\nAfter filtering, the channels are sampled in turn by analogue switches and each sample is\nconverted to a digital word, which is mixed in with the digital data as described later. For\nmost data, an overall accuracy of about 1% is sufficient, and an 8-bit analogue-to-digital\nconverter is used to achieve this.\n\nAnalogue commutation is invariably carried out in two stages: by a mainframe mul-\ntiplexer sampling at a relatively fast rate and a slower sub-multiplexer sampling at a\nbinary sub-multiple of the mainframe rate. The larger number of housekeeping channels\nthat need sampling only once or twice per minute use the sub-multiplexer, and the few\nchannels requiring fast sampling go straight into the main multiplexer.\n\nThis arrangement is very convenient because some of the sub-multiplexers can be\nremotely located in subsystems or payloads, reducing the complexity and mass of\nthe harness.\n\nDigital bi-level data arising from relay contact closures and so forth, is first conditioned\nto appropriate logic levels in which the \u2018off\u2019 state is represented by nominally zero voltage\nand the \u2018on\u2019 state by a positive voltage suitable for the integrated circuit (IC) logic family\nused. Individual bits are then grouped together into 8- or 16-bit words and sampled by\nlogic gates whose outputs are serialized in a parallel-to-serial converter and mixed in with\nthe main PCM data stream.\n\nDigital data is usually acquired in serial form, thereby simplifying the cable harness.\nSuch data is initially stored as an 8- or 16-bit word in a shift register located in the\n\n\n\nTELEMETRY DATA FORMATTING 13.3 445\n\nequipment generating the data. In equipment using processors, blocks of words in random\naccess memory are also used.\n\nIn normal PCM mode, the 8-bit parallel words from the analogue-to-digital converter\nand the serial digital multiplexer are loaded, together with bi-level status data, into a shift\nregister in the parallel-to-serial converter and clocked out at the telemetry bit rate as a\ncontinuous PCM bit stream. Unique synchronization and identification codes are inserted\nin the bit stream so that all data can be identified when it reaches the ground. Finally,\nthe bit stream is bi-phase modulated on to a coherent sub-carrier at an integral multiple\nof the bit rate before routing it to the two TM transmitters.\n\nIn many encoders, an alternative to the above allows sampling to be concentrated on a\nparticular word, to the exclusion of the other data. A \u2018dwell\u2019 mode is achieved by loading\nthe address of the desired channel into the control and timing block, which then sets up the\ninput multiplexers permanently to that channel instead of cycling round all the channels.\n\nWideband analogue signals bypass the PCM section of the encoder altogether, and\nfrequency modulates a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) instead, using one of the US\nInter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) standard centre frequencies. Since the phase-\nshift keying (PSK) sub-carrier and VCO frequencies are different, the PCM and FM\nchannels can operate simultaneously.\n\n13.3.4 Telemetry list and data format\n\nThe first step in designing the telemetry system is to draw up a telemetry list for the\nspacecraft. For each item, this will contain the signal identification, the type of data\n(analogue, digital bi-level, or digital serial), the required accuracy and the sampling rate\nrequired. This list is first established during the initial \u2018Phase A\u2019 feasibility study and it\nevolves with the project. It is important to allow enough spare channels at the outset to\ncater for natural growth as the project matures.\n\nThe next stage is to lay out the format of the PCM message, and a simple format con-\nsisting of eight frames, each containing 64 8-bit words, may be used. The first two words\nof each frame contain a fixed synchronization code, 16 bit long, which the ground station\nequipment will recognize as the start of a frame. The next word is a frame-identification\nchannel. The ground station de-commutation process is then able to identify every channel\nin the format and display the parameter contained in it on the \u2018quick look\u2019 facility at the\nstation. Further processing by computer provides outputs in engineering/scientific form\nfor users.\n\nThe rest of the format consists of data channels. A channel is typically sampled once in\nevery frame, and such a channel is known as a mainframe or prime channel, and could be\nused, for example, for a nutation sensor or other data source needing fast sampling. When\na still higher rate is required, the same data can be put into more than one mainframe\nword\u2014such a channel is said to be super-commutated.\n\nHousekeeping parameters requiring infrequent sampling can be sub-commutated by\nsampling only once per format.\n\nBy extending the principles of sub- and super-commutation over a longer sequence of\nframes, a wide variety of sampling rate needs can be accommodated, and once this is\ndone, the bit rate needed to provide every parameter with at least its minimum sampling\n\n\n\n446 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\nrate can be worked out. The sub-commutation depth of eight frames used in the above\nexample would not be sufficient for a typical communications satellite.\n\nThese PCM systems are used with spacecraft in which there may be existing\ninfrastructure and/or equipment, or where there is no need for the additional utility of a\nConsultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packet system.\n\n13.3.5 Packet telemetry\n\nThe CCSDS has produced a series of recommendations for data systems such as \u2018Packet\nTelemetry\u2019 [1] and \u2018Space Packet Protocol\u2019 [2], which have been adopted by ESA through\nthe European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS-E-ST-50 series). These super-\nsede the PCM Telemetry Standard. They represent the evolution from the time-division\nmultiplex methods used in the past and come into their own on multiagency projects such\nas the ISS, where increased interoperability and standardization are essential. The data\nflow in a packet telemetry system is illustrated in Figure 13.2.\n\nApplication data is first encapsulated by the source into a \u2018source packet\u2019 by prefacing\nthe data with a standard label known as the \u2018packet header\u2019. This is used to route the data\nthrough the system and must therefore contain identification of the source and its particular\napplications process, the number of the packet in the sequence of packets produced by\nthe source (so that the packets can be delivered in the right order at the data sink end\nof the link) and the length of the data field attached to the header. The provision to\nenable source packets exceeding a prescribed length to be segmented into several shorter\n\u2018telemetry packets\u2019 that can then be interleaved with packets from other sources has been\neliminated from the CCSDS standards.\n\nThe next stage is to assign each group of sources to a so-called \u2018virtual channel\u2019. The\npackets are inserted into fixed-length frames known as virtual channel data units (VCDU),\nwhich are then multiplexed into a single transfer frame for transmission on the downlink.\nIf necessary, each virtual channel can be sampled at a different rate, appropriate to the\nbandwidth of that channel.\n\nAfter transmission, the transfer frame can be de-multiplexed in the normal way, and\nthe telemetry and source packets can be reconstructed and routed to their destinations\nusing the headers. Labelling the source packet with all the necessary information about\nits routing and interpretation is the key to the flexibility of the packet system.\n\nA number of extensions to the packet system have been developed, providing even more\nutility and higher levels of protocol. The need is for reliable file transfer and internet-type\noperation. The CCSDS \u2018Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS)\u2019 [3], and \u2018Space Communi-\ncations Protocol Specification\u2019 [4] are two examples (see 13.5).\n\nThe advantage of using packet telemetry is its inherent adaptability to changing data-\ntransmission requirements. This is due to the variable-length nature of the packets and\nthe fact that the packet headers include fields that can be used to identify and interpret\nthe contents of the packet. The data length and periodicity are not constrained by hav-\ning to occupy a particular position within a TDM frame. Bandwidth is not wasted in\nsending periodic data to the ground, which is then discarded. Data packets can be issued\nasynchronously by any data source, and the packets can be of whatever length to accom-\nmodate the data requirements at that instant. The service provided by packet telemetry\n\n\n\nTELEMETRY DATA FORMATTING 13.3 447\n\nap1 ap2\n\nSource A\n\nap1 ap2 ap1 ap2 ap3 ap4\n\nSource C Source D\n\nap1 ap2 ap3\n\nSource B\n\nap1 ap2 ap3\n\nSource E\n\nSegment packets\n\nInsert packets or segments into frames of appropriate virtual \nchannels as required\n\nMultiplex the frames of different virtual channels into one\nsequence of frames\n\nCreate physical data channel\n\nTerminate physical data channel\n\nDemultiplex the frames of different virtual channels\n\nExtract packets or segments from appropriate\nvirtual channels if required\n\nSink A\n\nap1 ap2\n\nSink C\n\nap1 ap2\n\nSink B\n\nap1 ap2 ap3\n\nSink E\n\nap1 ap2 ap3\n\nSink D\n\nap1 ap2 ap3 ap4\n\nReconstitute packets from segments\n\nCCSDS recommendation for packet telemetry\n\nUnsegmented protocol: Segmented protocol:\n\nApplication\ndata:\n\nSource\npackets:\n\nSegments:\n\nVirtual\nchannels:\n\nTransfer\nframes:\n\nFigure 13.2 Packet telemetry data flow.

Space-qualified chip sets, software libraries, and global networks of earth\nstations are available, and there is a great body of expertise within the space industry.\n\n\n\n448 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\n13.3.6 Error-control coding\n\nOn communications spacecraft, there is usually enough transmitter power for a bit error\nrate (BER) of better than 1 in 105 on the downlink. The loss of even a complete frame\nis not catastrophic, so there is no great need for correction of such errors\u2014nevertheless\nan error-checking code is sometimes included in the frame.\n\nIn a typical scheme, this is the 16-bit remainder that results from dividing the data\nportion of the telemetry frame by a specified polynomial such as x 16 + x 12 + x 5 + 1. The\nremainder is placed in the last two words of the telemetry frame and transmitted to the\nground with the rest of the data. On the ground, the complete frame including the check\nbits is again divided by the same polynomial, and if a non-zero result is given, then the\nframe is flagged as being in error. This scheme is not able to correct errors and offers no\nsaving in transmitter power since the actual error rate on the link is unaffected.\n\nWhen forward error correction is needed, a scheme based on convolutional coding\nprovides good correction capability in a Gaussian noise channel and is simple to implement\nin hardware. Significant further improvement (particularly with bursts of errors) can be\nobtained by concatenating a Reed\u2013Solomon (RS) block code with the convolutional code.\nThe RS code is used as the outer code while the convolutional code is the inner one.\n\nOne application of forward error correction is in packet telemetry. This needs nearly\nerror-free channels for the successful routing and control of the data packets. The coding\ntechniques are used either singly or together and are an integral part of the standards.\n\nMissions involving very long transmission path lengths, such as the Huygens Probe\nsent to Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, require the application of coding. The telemetry transmitter\nmay then dominate the power budget, and the coding gain of several dB can be exploited\nto reduce the RF power needed for a given BER.\n\nJoint NASA/ESA telemetry coding guidelines have been issued to standardize on par-\nticular convolutional and block codes to facilitate network cross-support on joint missions.\nThe convolutional code recommended is the constraint length k = 7, rate r = 12 code that\nis in common use by ESA, and within NASA by the Goddard Space Flight Centre and\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory. CCSDS recommendations have been adopted by ESA. The\nECSS Telemetry synchronization and channel coding standard [5] provides convolution,\nRS, concatenated and turbo code standards.\n\nThe basic RS code is a (255, 223) code, which can be used either non-interleaved\n(I = 1) or interleaved to a depth of I = 5. This means that 223 I bytes of uncoded\ninformation are fed into the RS encoder and emerge unaltered with 32 I check symbol\nbytes appended. The whole code block of 255 I bytes is then transmitted, followed by\na further 223 I information bytes, and the cycle is repeated indefinitely. The RS code is\ncapable of correcting bursts of errors in up to 16 I consecutive bytes, and it can be seen\nthat the interleaved form is considerably more effective in combating long burst errors.\n\nThe RS code generator is a more complex proposition than the convolutional coder\nas it involves binary multiplication and the intermediate storage and processing of up to\n1275 bits in a shift register or equivalent RAM. However, custom chips, designed by both\nNASA and ESA, reduce the hardware to manageable proportions. Software solutions are\nalso used where the data rate is relatively modest and will be used increasingly as the\nperformance of space-qualified processors increase.\n\n\n\nTELECOMMAND 13.4 449\n\nUsing soft-decision Viterbi decoding , convolutional coding typically gives a 5.1 dB\nincrease in link margin (reducing the power requirement for a given rate to nearly a\nquarter). RS encoding can give a further 2.5 dB increase.\n\n13.3.7 Downlink frequencies and modulation\n\nA spacecraft uses one or more of the worldwide ground station networks for command,\ntelemetry and ranging, at least in the early mission phases. The frequency bands are\nconstrained to be those that are supported by the chosen ground stations.\n\nThe first step in choosing the band(s) to use is to contact the Frequency Management\nOffice of the networks concerned, with a request for the favoured frequency band. The\nsecond step is the selection of discrete frequencies within the allocated bands. This choice\nis a very complex and lengthy process because of the need for coordination with other\nspace agencies and national authorities.\n\nMany networks provide telemetry support in the ultra high-frequency (UHF) band, an\nexception being the Earth stations covering Intelsat missions.\n\nPhase modulation of the RF downlink is universally used, and there is a degree of com-\npatibility between the ESA and NASA standards, which allows cross-support, provided\ncertain limitations are observed.\n\nAt low bit rates, a PSK-modulated sub-carrier is used to prevent modulation sidebands\noccurring too near to the RF carrier and upsetting the phase-lock loops in the ground\nstation receivers. At higher bit rates a preferred alternative, achieving the same result, is\nto modulate the RF carrier directly with PCM-SPL data as defined in Figure 13.3.\n\nPre-modulation filtering of the square-wave PCM bit stream is usually provided to\nattenuate high-order modulation sidebands.\n\n13.4 TELECOMMAND\n\n13.4.1 Telecommand user interface\n\nFor relatively simple missions, there are three basic types of commands, as follows:\n\n\u2022 Low-level on\u2013off commands . These are logic-level pulses used to set or reset\nbi-stable logic.\n\n\u2022 High-level on\u2013off commands . These are higher-powered pulses, capable of operating\na latching relay or RF waveguide switch directly. Typically these may be 12 to 28 V\npulses lasting several tens of milliseconds and capable of supplying 90 mA for a\nrelay drive, or up to 600 mA to drive an electromechanical RF switch. Separate \u2018on\u2019\nand \u2018off\u2019 pulses are supplied on two different lines to drive the two coils of the\nlatching device.\n\n\u2022 Proportional commands . These are complete digital words, which may be used for\npurposes such as the reprogramming of memory locations in an on-board computer,\nor for setting up registers in the attitude control subsystem.\n\n\n\n450 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\nSymbol:\n\nLevel A\n\nLevel A\n\nLevel A\n\nLevel B\n\nLevel B\n\nTime\n\nLevel B\n\n1 0 0 0 01 1 1\n\nNRZ?L\n\nNRZ?M\n\nSP?L\n\nNRZ?L Level A signifies symbol '1'\n\nLevel B signifies symbol '0'\n\nNRZ?M Level change from A to B or B to A signifies symbol '1'\n\nNo change in level signifies symbol '0'\n\nSP?L Level A during the first half-symbol followed by level B\nduring the second signifies symbol '1'\n\nLevel B during the first half-symbol followed by level A\nduring the second signifies symbol '0'\n\nFigure 13.3 PCM waveforms\n\nEnough spare channels of each type need to be provided to allow for natural growth,\notherwise a redesign may be necessary at a later stage. This is controlled through the\ngeneration and maintenance of command lists.\n\nMore advanced missions require more sophisticated services, such as the ESA Packet\nUtilization Standard (PUS). This provides standard facilities for the above functions as\nwell as features for loading timelines, loading, checking and dumping memory, software\npatching and so forth. The PUS also includes standard telemetry services.\n\n\n\nTELECOMMAND 13.4 451\n\n13.4.2 PCM telecommand standards\u2014Intelsat and the US\n\nAir Force Satellite Control Facility (SCF)\n\nThe agencies responsible for the ground station networks publish standards covering\nspace\u2013ground interface requirements and procedures to be adhered to for the transmission\nof commands. Their purpose is to ensure compatibility between the spacecraft and the\nequipment at the ground station. Conformance to these standards is mandatory and any\ndeviations for a particular mission have to be justified and approved by the agency before\nbeing included in the design.\n\nIn GEO, with continuous visibility from several Earth stations, it is very seldom that a\nsequence of commands has to be sent within a short period of time. The Intelsat command\nstandards are therefore based upon a command-verify-execute strategy in which each com-\nmand is held in the satellite decoder and verified through telemetry before it is executed.\n\nFigure 13.4 shows a simplified block diagram of a typical decoder for an Intelsat\nspacecraft. The explanation relates primarily to the Intelsat V system, but more recent\nspacecraft in the series have used fundamentally similar principles.\n\nThe command uplink signal consists of a sequence of tones that represent data 0, data\n1 and execute information \u2018bits\u2019. These are frequency-modulated on the 6-GHz carrier\nand demodulated by the two command receivers. The ground operator is able to choose\nwhich receiver is to be used by selecting either of two alternative data 0 tone frequencies.\n\nEach digital command message includes an introductory series of zeros to select the\nreceiver and to synchronize the bit detector clock, and this is followed by a decoder\naddress word, a command vector, and finally an on\u2013off command word or a proportional\ndata command word. The 0 and 1 bits comprising the message are stored in a shift register.\n\nEach command unit has a unique address, which is hardwired, and only messages\ncontaining this address will be accepted. The data held in the command message store are\ntelemetered to the ground for verification, and assuming this is satisfactory, an execute tone\n\n28 V power\n\n5 V power\n\nExecute\npower\n\nPower\nswitch\n\nAddress\ndetector\n\nVector\ndecoder\n\nCMD\nRX1\nCMD\nRX2\n\nBit\ndetector\n\nCross strapping\nto command\ndecoder 2\n\nSerial\n\n1,0,clock\n\nCommand\nmessage store\n\nVerification data\nto telemetry\n\nPulse\noutputs\n\nProportional\noutputs\n\nCommands\nto\n\nspacecraft\n\nRelay\ncontact\nclosure\noutputs\n\nFigure 13.4 Telecommand decoder\n\n\n\n452 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\nburst is sent. This turns on the execute power switch, which then outputs the command\nto the specified user channel. The combination of power switching and the use of diode\nisolation and redundant components in the output circuits allows the outputs of the two\ncommand decoders to be combined in a fail-safe manner without loss of reliability due\nto single-point failure modes. The US Air Force SCF tracking network used a basically\nsimilar ternary (three-tone) modulation scheme using frequency-shift keyed tones.\n\n13.4.3 PCM telecommand standards\u2014ESA and NASA\n\nAgencies supporting scientific and LEO missions often need to send rapid sequences of\ncommands in a short time period, such as during a brief ground station pass. Although\nthe ESA and NASA systems do make use of ground verification, the structure of the\ntelecommand message allows the checking and correction to take place inside the satel-\nlite\u2019s decoder itself.\n\nThe ESA telecommand message starts with a fixed number of acquisition bits to initial-\nize the message, usually fifteen \u2018zeros\u2019 followed by a single \u2018one\u2019. The message sequence\nproper then consists of an unbroken sequence of one or more 96-bit frames similar to that\nshown in Figure 13.5. A single 16-bit spacecraft address and synchronization word (ASW)\nis used to terminate the message. The initial 16-bit ASW is used to identify individual\nspacecraft and to synchronize the decoder.\n\nA 4-bit mode selection word using 2-out-of-4 redundant coding is included in\neach frame after the ASW. This word is repeated once and provides means for\nselecting on\u2013off pulse commands, proportional commands or time-tagged commands for\ndelayed execution.\n\nSince a single-bit error will give an invalid mode word, the acceptance criterion in\nFigure 13.5 ensures the acceptance of a command even if a single-bit error has occurred,\nand its rejection if more than one error has taken place. In addition, a command receiver\nsquelch cuts off the input to the bit detector if the signal-to-noise ratio is too low, thus\nensuring a low bit error probability (normally better than 10?5) and a correspondingly\nhigh probability of frame acceptance.\n\nThe three data words following the mode word are each of eight bits and represent\nrespectively the address of the 16-bit memory to which the data are to be sent, the first\neight bits of data and the final eight bits of data. Each data word is repeated once to\nincrease the probability of acceptance, and four Hamming-code check bits are appended\nto each word to permit error detection and correction in the spacecraft. By comparing the\nreceived check bits with a set generated locally from the data word, it is possible to detect\nall single- and double-bit errors and, in the case of single-bit errors only, to determine\nwhich data bit is in error and correct it.\n\nThe end-to-end probability of command rejection can be reduced to less than 1 in 106,\nand the probability of an erroneous command to less than 1 in 108.\n\nSpacecraft that use the ESA standards are compatible with the NASA ground network\nand procedures, whose modulation and coding techniques are to a large extent compatible.\n\n13.4.4 Packet telecommand\n\nThe PCM telecommand standards have been superseded by a packet-based system, which\nhas some similarity to the packet telemetry system.

These layers are as follows:\n\n\u2022 An Application Process Layer allows in-orbit payloads or subsystems to be\ncontrolled remotely by a user, providing the interface from humans and their\ncomputers. It can also be used to support advanced higher-level protocols such as\nfile management.\n\n\u2022 A System Management Layer provides the translation between the commanding lan-\nguage used in the Application Process and the detailed communications and control\nlanguage used in the Packetization layer.\n\n\u2022 A Packetization Layer allows the user to optimize his application data with minimum\nconstraints and independently from other users. The application data is formed into\nTC packets consisting of a fixed-length packet header of 48 bits and a variable-\nlength packet data field. The header provides identification, sequence control and\npacket length. Data field headers and packet error control may be added to the data\nfield as options.\n\n\u2022 A Segmentation Layer provides the mechanism for a number of variable-length TC\npackets to be formed into one virtual channel. It also enables the multiplexing of TC\npackets from a number of different sources and control of the data flow. The standard\nstructure of a TC segment consists of an 8-bit segment header, a variable-length\nsegment data field and an optional variable-length trailer.\n\n\u2022 The Transfer Layer uses TC transfer frames to provide error-free transfer of data\nover the RF link. Two types of transfer frame provide for sequence control, and one\nfor an expedited service typically used in recovery situations. The standard structure\nof a TC transfer frame consists of a 40-bit frame header, a variable-length data field\n(containing one TC segment) and a 16-bit frame error-control field.\n\n\u2022 A Coding Layer provides the error correction and the synchronization required by\nthe receiver. Each transfer frame is placed into a single command link transfer unit\n(CLTU). The CLTU consists of a 16-bit start sequence, n code blocks of up to 64 bits\nand a tail sequence the same length as a code block. Here n is an integer, sufficient\nto encompass one encoded transfer frame, with fill data being used when required.\nThe code applied is a (63,56) using the polynomial x 7 + x 6 + x 2 + x 0 to produce a\n7-bit parity covering up to 56 bits of data.\n\n\u2022 The Physical Layer is the radio link itself and operates in one of four Carrier Mod-\nulation Modes. These are\n\n1. unmodulated RF carrier,\n2. modulated with Acquisition sequence,\n3. modulated with one protocol data unit (CLTU),\n4. modulated with Idle sequence.\n\nThe receiver, demodulator/command decoder and OBDH operate on the same layers\nbut in reverse order. At each stage, telemetry reporting is fed back to ground, providing\nconfirmation of good receipt and successful command operation when applicable.\n\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES AND PROTOCOLS 13.5 455\n\nAs is the case for packet telemetry, packet telecommand protocols provide the user with\ngreater flexibility than the earlier standards. It accommodates the dynamic commanding\nneeded for advanced satellite operation. It makes possible complex interactions between\nground and spacecraft such as software uploads, on-board file system manipulation and\neven access to web sites on the satellite from anywhere on the terrestrial internet.\n\n13.4.5 Error-control coding\n\nIn general, error-control encoding is a less intensive processing task than decoding. For\ntelemetry links, this places the more complex error-control tasks in the ground segment.\nIt is difficult to implement powerful telecommand error-control decoding in the space\nsegment because of the constraints on on-board electronic systems. For this reason, the\nerror coding in telecommand standards is rather basic. The CCSDS telecommand rec-\nommendations choose a Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenchem (BCH) algorithm whose major\nstrength lies in error detection. Indeed, the failure of this code is used to denote the end\nof a telecommand frame.\n\nIn any case, error control via coding still leaves a small but significant possibility of\nerror, which may not be important for telemetry but could be disastrous in a mission\ncritical command. Command links in general, therefore, use an automatic retransmission\nmechanism (the CCSDS protocol is known as COP-1) to guarantee command deliv-\nery by detecting errors and retransmitting failed frames. The protocol also ensures that\ntelecommands are always received and executed in the correct sequence.\n\n13.4.6 Uplink frequencies and modulation\n\nCommand uplink frequencies are typically in the S-band (2025\u20132120 MHz) or X-band\n(7145\u20137235 MHz) and support relatively modest data rates. The early ESA RF and\nModulation scheme is based on a sub-carrier and a maximum data rate of 4 ksymbol/s.\nHowever, newer applications require higher rates and thus the CCSDS developed a mod-\nulation standard that supports rates of up to 256 ksymbol/s using Split Phase-Level/Phase\nModulation (SP-L/PM) directly on the carrier. More advanced schemes are given in the\nECCS standards [7].\n\nStill higher rates are possible by using direct bi-phase-shift keying (BPSK) carrier mod-\nulation, although, unlike the lower rate systems, this will not support simultaneous ranging.\n\n13.5 COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES AND PROTOCOLS\n\n13.5.1 Ranging\n\nRanging is achieved by means of a transponder, which is integrated into the telemetry-\ncommand subsystem. This retransmits ranging tones through the telemetry channels in\nresponse to tones received via the command route.\n\nOn Intelsat X, the output of a command receiver on a 6-GHz carrier can be connected\nto a beacon transmitter that phase-modulates the ranging tones on to the 4-GHz downlink\n\n\n\n456 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\ncarrier. On Earth-observation satellites such as Envisat these operations are carried out\nusing the S-band links. The signals are tones as specified in the ESA ranging standards.\nThese may be phase-modulated on to the uplink carrier in place of command signals and\non to the downlink simultaneously with telemetry signals. Interference on the downlink is\navoided by the choice of sub-carrier frequencies. Also, integrated Doppler measurements\nare made in order to provide spacecraft tracking\u2014see Reference [8].\n\n13.5.2 Advanced orbiting systems (AOS)\n\nIn the late 1980s, the requirements of the ISS, and space transportation systems such\nas Hermes and Earth-observation systems outgrew the capabilities of the CCSDS packet\ntelemetry scheme.\n\nThe deficiencies were in the areas of\n\n\u2022 support for isochronous (e.g. voice/video) services,\n\u2022 support for high-volume downlinks (e.g. Earth-observation imagery, including syn-\n\nthetic aperture radar (SAR), video, etc.),\n\u2022 support for interactive services (e.g. two-way fast file transfer).\n\nThe CCSDS recommendations addressed these issues and also took the opportunity\nto adopt a service-driven structure to the recommendation rather than the protocol/data\nformat-oriented system of the packet TM recommendations. AOS is used in the down-\nlinks of the ISS and Envisat. AOS also introduced networking to the CCSDS standards,\nwith the incorporation of the efficient connection-oriented path protocol and support for\nthe ISO 8473 connectionless network protocol\u2014subsequently amended to support the\nInternet Protocol (IP).\n\n13.5.3 Proximity links\n\nCCSDS Proximity-1 is applicable to power-constrained links and is specifically designed\nfor use in inter-satellite links, constellation missions and planetary orbiter/lander/rover\nconfigurations.\n\nProximity-1 operates symmetrically\u2014that is, there is no distinction between teleme-\ntry and telecommand or forward and return links. Proximity-1 includes facilities for\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 Automatic detection of link availability and the negotiation of link parameters. A\nmedium access control (MAC) sub-layer provides for the establishment of a link\nbefore data is transferred, its maintenance and termination. It also controls link char-\nacteristics, such as data rates, and the state of the data link and physical parameters.\n\n\u2022 Reliable, in-sequence, complete delivery in both directions through the use of\nautomatic retransmission. This uses a process known as \u2018persistence\u2019 to verify\ncorrect transfer.\n\n\u2022 Convolutional and RS coding in both directions.\n\u2022 Use of fixed-length or variable-length frames.\n\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES AND PROTOCOLS 13.5 457\n\nExploration missions to Mars are typical examples in which Proximity-1 may be used. It\nuses features adapted from both the CCSDS packet telemetry and telecommand standards.\n\n13.5.4 Space communications protocol standards (SCPS)\n\nNASA initiated the SCPS development in collaboration with the US DoD. It was driven by\nperceived requirements for military and civil satellite constellations and sensor networks.\nSCPS takes the existing protocols used in the networking, transport and application layers\nof the terrestrial Internet and extends them to cater for the more onerous requirements\nof space networking. The components of the SCPS protocol suite are the SCPS network\nprotocol (SCPS-NP), security protocol (SCPS-SP), transport protocol (SCPS-TP) and file\nprotocol (SCPS-FP).\n\nThe application of SCPS to space missions has been slow, and is particularly applicable\nto more complex space constellations. However, there has been much interest in its use\nin terrestrial applications that have constraints similar to the space environment.\n\n13.5.5 CCSDS file delivery protocol (CFDP)\n\nCFDP provides a reliable data-transfer service. It is an application process (see Section\n13.4.4) that operates over CCSDS or other link and networking protocols. The major\nfeatures of CFDP are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Store and forward networking differs from real-time networking in that an end-to-end\npath does not have to be present at the same time to allow networked communications.\nThe protocol takes account of a dynamic network configuration with disjointed links.\n\n\u2022 Continuous file delivery supports the delivery of unbounded TM streams. It can\ndeliver file segments as they arrive, as well as deliver what can be recovered from\na failed file transfer.\n\n\u2022 Negative automatic report queuing (ARQ) scheme guarantees data delivery and is\noptimized for large bandwidth/delay products and for a low overhead in the return\npath. The retransmission requests can be optimized for operations; for example, they\ncan be issued as errors occur or can be bundled together until a suitable opportunity\nfor retransmission occurs.\n\n\u2022 Proxy transfer facilities provide for third-party control of data transfer.\n\u2022 Graceful suspend/resume for predictable link outages.\n\u2022 Garbage clearance facilities protocol recognizes that software may have faults or\n\nmay be disrupted by single-event upsets (SEU) and ensures that systematic errors do\nnot accumulate and require operator intervention.\n\n\u2022 File Manipulation allows for the remote naming, deletion, copying and management\nof on-board file systems.\n\nThe CFDP protocol has emerged from requirements to support spacecraft with on-board\nfile systems and to provide a reliable service for bulk data transfer. This is particularly\nthe case for spacecraft telemetry in which advances in on-board autonomy and data\ncompression, which reduced the data redundancy in the downlink, making uncorrected\nbit errors less intolerable.\n\n\n\n458 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\n13.5.6 The interplanetary internet (IPN)\n\nThe IPN is an initiative of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). The IRTF is an\nInternet-based group largely responsible for the future direction of Internet development.\nThe IPN Research Group (IPNRG) carries out this development. Despite its name, the\ninitiative is intended to reach out into all space networking applications and incorporates\nboth near-Earth and deep space applications.\n\nThe IPN consists of the following:\n\n\u2022 In situ Internets are deployed Internets such as the Earth\u2019s Internet, a Mars Inter-\nnet or an Internet local to a satellite constellation. These are composed, in general,\nof dedicated sub-network protocols supporting common transmission control proto-\ncol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) for the network and transport.\n\n\u2022 The Interplanetary backbone provides a long-haul transport service between remotely\ndeployed Internets. The long-haul transport protocol (LTP) is currently under devel-\nopment and uses some of the techniques developed for the CFDP.\n\n\u2022 Interplanetary gateways connect deployed Internets to each other or to the interplan-\netary backbone.\n\n\u2022 Inter-Internet dialogues provide the store and forward networking necessary to oper-\nate with either long delays or disjointed communications resulting from orbital or\nplanetary motion. It provides the store and forward networking required to intercon-\nnect deployed Internets.\n\nThe inter-Internet dialogues are based on the concept of bundling. Just as the IP net-\nworking layer provides a common means of data transfer across heterogeneous subnets\nin real time, bundling provides a common means of data transfer across heterogeneous\nInternets in a store and forward environment.\n\nIt is expected that, in the interplanetary environment, special bundle applications will\nneed to be developed to avoid an excess of short discrete transfers, as would be the case\nif some common email exchange protocols, such as SMTP, were used.\n\n13.6 ON-BOARD DATA HANDLING (OBDH)\n\nAND PROCESSING\n\n13.6.1 Platform and payloads\n\nThe OBDH functions reside both on the spacecraft platform and within the payloads.\nThey provide both the command and data management associated with the telemetry and\ntelecommand operations discussed earlier. Communications spacecraft such as Inmarsat\nhave separate and very complex payloads for the receipt and transmission of the user data.\nRemote sensing and scientific spacecraft often have separate provision for the handling\nand transmission of instrument data. The latter may require special measures to cater for\nvery high data rates. For example, synthetic aperture radar can generate data at rates from\naround 100 Mbps to over 1 Gbps.\n\nClassical OBDH architectures are based upon a central processor, typically connected\nvia a video or digital path to the RF communications subsystem. This central processor will\n\n\n\nON-BOARD DATA HANDLING (OBDH) AND PROCESSING 13.6 459\n\ncommunicate with the platform subsystems such as the AOCS and the payloads using a\nserial bus with high data integrity. ESA spacecraft typically used an ESA standard OBDH\nbus operating at 250 kbps with separate Interrogation and Response lines, transformer-\ncoupled and Litton-encoded. A variety of terminal devices are used depending on the\nparticular need.\n\nMore recent ESA and other agency spacecraft use a bus based on the Military Standard\n1553B, as does the Ariane launch vehicle. The 1553 bus is a serial bus capable of operating\nat 765 kbps and more, using transformer coupling and Manchester encoding. The speed of\nsuch buses is gradually being increased. It is interesting to note that certain spacecraft have\nbeen designed with mixed bus architectures to allow flexibility in equipment procurement.\n\nThe central processor has two primary functions. These are to provide for telecom-\nmand decoding and to operate as the central terminal for the bus. Depending upon the\nspacecraft needs, these functions may be implemented using from one to five separate\nunits. The precise arrangement will depend upon the mission. It may be necessary to\nbe able to extract, prior to any processing, certain high-priority commands for config-\nuration switching operations. The subsystem may be involved in the arming and firing\nof pyrotechnic devices. Also, expanded macrocommands and time-tagged commands are\noften required. Ultrastable oscillators may be incorporated for accurate timing of control\nfunctions and for datation purposes. Certain missions where ground contact is not contin-\nuous will require a degree of autonomous operation or at least a fail-safe survival mode.\nAn example of a remote sensing platform is given in Figure 13.6, in which the central\nprocessor has become a data-handling subsystem.\n\nTerminal devices vary considerably and can be either stand-alone units or embedded\nwithin an instrument or subsystem. Stand-alone units may be unintelligent, as in the case\nof a remote terminal unit (RTU), or sophisticated communications processors. The RTU\ncaters for bus coupling and the Litton code. It provides the distribution of simple 16-bit\nserial memory load and single-bit discrete commands, and high-level commands with the\n\nKa-band\ntransponder\n\nPEB\n\nSM TC\n\nTC\n\nTM\n\nCentral\ncommunication\n\nunit\n\nHousekeeping\nand\n\npyrotechnic unit\n\nDecoding and\nreconfiguration\n\nelectronics\n\nEDR housekeeping\n\nS-band\ncommunication\n\nsubsystem\n\nOBDH data\nbus\n\nFigure 13.6 Data-handling subsystem (central processor)\n\n\n\n460 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\ncapability to drive relays directly. It provides for the collection of 8/16-bit serial and\ndiscrete bi-level telemetry. The RTU may also include the conditioning and analogue-to-\ndigital conversion of analogue telemetry. An RTU will typically use a switched matrix to\nprovide for a high number of interfaces whilst minimizing the amount of internal circuits.\nIt will include multiplexing and de-multiplexing functions.\n\nCommunications processors operate as Intelligent Terminal Units and can provide\ndata-packetization services for the payloads. The interfaces between a Communications\nProcessor and the payload may be either through dedicated ports or a bus.\n\nEmbedded terminals can operate as either mini-RTUs or more sophisticated remote bus\ninterfaces (RBIs), which provide for direct memory access within the payload. In both\nthese cases, separate units handle bus coupling and Litton-coded functions.\n\nThe more complex instruments may include their own processor-based intelligent con-\ntrol units (ICU) utilizing an embedded RBI. The processing power of some payloads\nsometimes exceeds the capability of the platform computers.\n\nPayload processors can provide the functions of a communications processor, ICU and\nscience data processor.\n\nA typical on-board computer will use a 32-bit microprocessor, a microcontroller or dig-\nital signal processor (DSP)\u2014built in radiation hard or tolerant technology. The embedded\nsoftware will be produced to high standards controlling the software life cycle by address-\ning aspects such as documentation, review, structure, margins and verification. Secure\nmethods and tools are used including object-orientated techniques and high-level lan-\nguages such as ADA or C-ANSI. Optimized operating systems are an option. Normally,\nthe system would be designed to allow the flight software to be patched and dumped,\nallowing modification and investigations to be carried out in orbit.\n\nThe production of on-board code is evolving from the situation where every line of\non-board code was written for that particular mission, or at the very most, inherited\nfrom a very similar mission. The processing power and storage available on-board\nare following terrestrial industrial processors, and the mission requirements are also\nevolving towards those prevalent in terrestrial control applications. These trends manifest\nthemselves in requirements for complex data organization, autonomous decision-making,\nintensive signal processing and multitasking, and the coordination of large distributed\ndevelopment teams.\n\nThe production of such software systems for highly reliable application has been\naddressed in terrestrial systems and has resulted in the availability of high integrity,\nreal-time operating systems. These are now finding their way onto on-board processing\nsystems and bring the advantages of\n\n\u2022 faster, cheaper development,\n\u2022 ease of maintenance and developer team coordination,\n\u2022 off-the-shelf development systems,\n\u2022 off-the-shelf processing and communications libraries,\n\u2022 built-in file handling, multitasking and inter-task communication,\n\u2022 large investment in software reliability.\nThe instrument data is often collected by a separate data-handling system, one example\n\nbeing known as the payload data handling and transmission (PDHT ) system. These sys-\ntems allow for the direct and independent collection of data at rates much higher than what\ncan be handled by standard buses. They have their own dedicated RF ground link. Such\n\n\n\nON-BOARD DATA HANDLING (OBDH) AND PROCESSING 13.6 461\n\nsystems will embrace high-speed multiplexing of data packets and provide data storage\nwhen direct ground contact is not available. Magnetic tape recorders were used for a long\ntime with capacities of 10 Gbits and more. However, the availability of very high-density\nsemiconductor memories has enabled modern spacecraft to use solid-state data stores.\nThey offer the advantage of random access, plus the option of applying architectures\ncapable of operating with peak rates of several Gbits per second and terrabit capacities.\n\n13.6.2 Instruments, experiments and sensors\n\nFigure 13.7 illustrates the main elements that might exist in a spacecraft generalized\ninstrument, experiment or sensor. A payload may consist of one or more of these, some\ntypical examples being\n\n\u2022 active radars, such as Altimeters or the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR)\non the Envisat spacecraft;\n\n\u2022 passive microwave sounders, such as the Micro Humidity Sounder (MHS) on the\nNOAA and METOP spacecraft;\n\n\u2022 IR and visible spectrum radiometers, such as on the METEOSAT series of spacecraft;\n\u2022 multi- or hyper-spectral instruments, such as the Compact High-Resolution Imaging\n\nSpectrometer (CHRIS) on the PROBA spacecraft;\n\nConversion\n\nDetection\n\nStorage\n\nSignal\nprocessing \n\nData\ncompression \n\nControl\n\nData output\n(source data)\n\nData\ndown link \n\nScene\n\nMechanisms,\ncoolers\u2026 \n\nOff-line\nprocessing\n\nTiming\n\nBUS\n\nFront end\noptics, RF...\n\nFigure 13.7 Generalized instrument\n\n\n\n462 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\n\u2022 laser-based instruments such as the ALADIN Lidar for the Aeolus mission;\n\u2022 star sensors used for attitude control;\n\u2022 science instruments, such as on the Rosetta Spacecraft.\n\nExcept for the simplest case, most systems will have a controller that provides the\nfunctional interface with the platform and provides local and typically real-time operation.\nIn addition, there may be digital signal processing and data-handling functions to support.\nThe data output from these systems will typically be in source packet format. Many\ninstruments are multimode.\n\nThe controller will typically be a standard microprocessor, such as the SPARC based\nLEON. Alternatively, a DSP device, such as the TSC21020F operating at 20 MIPS and 60\nMFLOPs, has been used where signal processing is required in addition to the instrument\ncontrol function. At the time of writing, DSP developments for space applications requir-\ning 1 GFLOPS products are in progress. In some applications standard processor designs\nsuch as the LEON, or high performance DSP functions are embedded within application-\nspecific integrated circuits (ASICs), with appropriate intellectual property arrangements.\nThese standard designs are known as \u2018IP cores\u2019.\n\nDigital communication within an instrument may be based on a multi-drop bus or\ndedicated parallel and point-to-point serial links.\n\nMulti-drop buses , such as the ESA OBDH, the Mil Std 1553B and the CAN bus,\nare used where one device (master) needs to communicate with more than one other\ndevice (terminal). They are used for commanding and gathering telemetry from intelligent\ndevices. They are also used for gathering science or instrument data at modest rates of\nup to around 1 Mbps.\n\nPoint-to-Point Links , such as the Mil Std 1355, ESA SpaceWire [9], HotLinks and\nGigaLink, are used for direct communication between two devices. They are particularly\nsuited for the transfer of blocks of data and can support much higher rates than the multi-\ndrop bus. Rates can vary from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps plus. A number of parallel point-to-point\nlinks may be used to support higher rates and data-routing functions.\n\n13.6.3 Signal processing\n\nSignal processing in this context is applicable to platform sensors and operation, and to\npayload experiments and instruments, in both analogue and digital form. The nature of\nthe processing and the speed at which it is done vary considerably.\n\nPlatform operation and sensors \u2014control and navigation subsystems rely on a num-\nber of sensors providing information on the Sun, Earth, stars, spacecraft inertia, and so\nforth as inputs to the control algorithms (see Chapter 9). Sensing elements require sig-\nnal conditioning, conversion to digital form, detection, and the manipulation of the data\nacquired to yield the information. Charge-coupled device (CCD) and Active Pixel detec-\ntor arrays, as found in conventional digital cameras, require timing, read-out circuits, and\nanalogue-to-digital conversion. Such sensors produce data at rates of typically 20 Mbps.\n\nPayload experiments and instruments often require the processing of a baseband signal\nin either the time or frequency domain. Some examples are digital filtering, compression,\nfeature extraction, data formatting, error control, and encryption. Operation with a number\nof single channels, each at up to 200 Mbps or more may be required.\n\n\n\nON-BOARD DATA HANDLING (OBDH) AND PROCESSING 13.6 463\n\n13.6.4 Compression and storage\n\nData compression can be achieved by eliminating the redundant or duplicate content of\nthe data. Image compression can be achieved by eliminating, for example, unwanted\ninformation or by reducing the resolution.\n\nOn-line Data Compression such as block-adaptive quantization may be used to reduce\nthe data rate to more manageable proportions and would typically reduce the rate by factors\nfrom 2 to 8. They operate in real time on the data stream, perhaps taking advantage of\nfirst-in-first-out (FIFO) buffering.\n\nOff-line Data Compression usually works in conjunction with a large data store and\nwould run in dedicated processors or ASICs. There are many algorithms available that can\ngive lossless compression with a reduction factor of perhaps 2, or lossy compression with\nreduction factors of up to and beyond 100. The selection of the algorithm really depends\non the information required from the data and the data reduction needs. Compression\nalgorithms are available to established standards such as Java Picture Experts Group\n(JPEG) and CCSDS [10].\n\nData storage is an important function for missions in which the data volume pro-\nduced is greater than the link capacity and/or availability. Where tape recorders were\nonce employed, solid-state memories using dynamic RAM are used, providing very large\ncapacities. Typically, they do not have external addressing to each RAM location but\noperate on a block or file basis. The block may be of the order of 1000 bytes or some-\ntimes it will correspond to one source packet. It is important to maintain the integrity of\nthe data and so data coding and error correction is employed to protect against errors such\nas those caused by SEUs induced by cosmic radiation. The detailed arrangements of the\ninput and output busses have to take into account the data rates and volumes produced by\nthe instrument and the corresponding capability of the following downlink. To provide for\nflexible operation and degradation in the memory array, a data-routing function is usually\nincluded on both the input and output.\n\nThe large capacity of on-board mass memory has led to the same challenges in orga-\nnizing stored data as is found on disk storage in terrestrial computers. The data is best\narranged hierarchically, with data files identified by name rather than exact locations. This\nis leading to two trends\u2014firstly, the adoption of industrial real-time operating systems,\nas mentioned earlier, and secondly, the requirement for remote file manipulation facilities\nas provided by the CFDP protocol.\n\n13.6.5 Data downlinks\n\nA typical System Architecture will consist of a data-handling function followed by a RF\ntransmit chain or chains. The data handling needs to provide for data routing, the buffering\nof different input and output data rates (using a simple FIFO or a large data store), data\nformatting, carrier modulation, amplification and the generation of an RF beam.\n\nModulation techniques are normally quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), or of a\nhigher order. In the case of QPSK, a 100-Mbps data stream would require an RF bandwidth\nof 55 MHz. The bandwidth available for LEO missions in X-band is 8025 to 8400 GHz,\nwhich with guard bands can support around 500 Mbps. However, permission has to be\n\n\n\n464 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\nobtained from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and it is unlikely that\nall of the frequency range would be granted to one mission.\n\nAmplification to achieve an equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of typically\n15 dBW would normally require travelling wave tube or solid-state amplifiers and\nan antenna system with some gain. There are many antenna solutions ranging from\nfixed pseudo-omni-reflectors to very focused electronically steered beams. The beam\nhas to be well controlled to achieve a reliable link over the required area of the earth\nand to limit the power flux density to satisfy World Administrative Radio Conference\n(WARC) regulations.\n\nLink Layer data processing is needed to convert source packets into physical channel\naccess protocol data units (PCA-PDU). This includes the formatting to establish VCDU,\nas required by the selected CCSDS standard; pseudo-randomization to smooth out the\nspectral content of the data and the addition of synchronization bits to enable the ground\nprocessing to recover the randomized data, forming channel access data units (CADU);\ndifferential encoding to resolve phase ambiguities; and the splitting of the data into in-\nphase and quadrature (IQ) channels prior to the modulator. Forward error correction may\noptionally be included to improve the link budget.\n\nThe Link Availability is an important system design consideration for LEO missions\nand it depends upon the spacecraft orbit and the location of the ground station. Typically,\nthe link to a reasonably high latitude station will be available from 3 to 10 minutes during\none orbit of 100 minutes. Low latitude stations will have a significant number of orbits\nwith no availability.\n\n13.7 TECHNOLOGY\n\nSpacecraft data-handling systems are implemented using electronics technology. The\nspace environment places major constraints on the use of this technology in a num-\nber of ways. The spacecraft resources available to electronic systems are limited. The\nthree major parameters that are at a premium are mass, power and volume. The physical\nenvironment is very stressful for electronics components and subsystems. These must be\nchosen and designed to withstand the rigours of launch vibration and in-orbit temperature\nextremes. They must also be compatible with the vacuum environment in not having pres-\nsurized voids in the packaging (common in plastic packages) and having no outgassing\nmaterials that may contaminate other spacecraft equipment, for example, optical surfaces.\n\nA major consideration when choosing appropriate components is the radiation environ-\nment. There are three effects to be considered (see also Chapter 2):\n\n\u2022 Single Event Upsets (SEU ) are temporary effects due to ionizing radiation changing\nthe state of an electronics node on a semiconductor device. The effects are unpre-\ndictable. SEUs can cause noise in data, random switching events, changes in memory\nlocations, random jumps in software code or illegal state-machine configurations.\nData stored over a long period in on-board memory is subject to randomization by\ncumulative SEUs. The effects can be mitigated using error-correction codes, which\nare checked on a regular basis and the data is corrected if necessary. This is known\nas memory scrubbing. Other circuits may be protected using voting logic (e.g. triple\nmodule redundancy) and by incorporating software watchdog timers.\n\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY 13.7 465\n\n\u2022 Total Dose damage is due to the cumulative effect of ionizing radiation over time.\nThe result is a catastrophic device failure. A device\u2019s tolerance to total dose is\nmeasured in krads, and the immunity required varies from 1 krad to around 100 krad\ndepending on the spacecraft trajectory and lifetime. Devices can be shielded from\ntotal dose effects by the spacecraft structure, by the equipment housing, by specific\ndevice packaging or spot shielding.\n\n\u2022 Latch up is another catastrophic condition and is caused by a single energetic ion\ninitiating a runaway current flow in the device leading to failure. Again, shielding\ncan help (although the emission of secondary ions can exacerbate the effect). An\nalternative strategy is to protect the device with current sensing and limiting circuitry\nthat blocks the runaway effects and returns it to normal operation when the event\nhas passed.\n\nNote that the above catastrophic effects are significantly reduced when devices are\nunpowered. Another mitigation strategy is therefore to power-down electronic subsystems\nwhen not required.\n\nMicroprocessors that are specifically designed for use in the space environment emulate\nthose available for terrestrial uses. However, they tend to lag terrestrial technology by\na number of years. This is not necessarily a problem. Routine spacecraft processing\ntasks such as attitude control, housekeeping reporting, systems management, command\nexecution and timeline sequencing require very little processing power. In this case, simple\n8-bit microcontrollers have been adequate for the task.\n\nIt is worth remembering that many support devices such as RAM, ROM, buffers, and\nso forth come with limited width or serial interfaces. Choosing a microprocessor with a\nwide data bus causes a proportionate increase in the number of support devices, and a\nminimum bus width should always be selected.\n\nFor more demanding applications, 32-bit processors and signal processors are available\nin space-qualified technology. These are limited in processing power compared to their\nterrestrial counterparts, but find application in hosting complex spacecraft or payload\nsoftware, or in performing intensive signal processing tasks.\n\nAlthough some processors have been produced in space-qualified technology, the same\ncannot be said for peripheral devices. Universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter\u2019s\n(UART), dynamic RAM controllers, I/O controllers and communications devices usually\nneed to be implemented on a custom basis using field programmable technology.\n\nThe electronics design cycle for spacecraft electronics used to be very costly. Past\nsolutions used discrete digital devices with typically less than 50 gates per device. This\nresulted in large assemblies and a number of generations of costly and time-consuming\nprinted circuit board (PCB) layout, before a satisfactory flight design was reached. The\nsize of the electronics systems was greatly reduced by the advent of ASICs. The ASIC\ndesign and modification process is, however, costly and time consuming.\n\nRadiation-hard field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are now in common usage.\nThese can host a very large number of functions and can be designed and programmed\nusing a desktop computer. This significantly decreases the time required to complete a\ndesign. Some devices can be continuously modified; others can only be programmed once.\nFor critical or mass production applications, FPGAs are often used to prototype ASIC\ndesigns. The use of FPGAs can result in a single-board layout cycle in which the philoso-\nphy is to route all signals on the board into the FPGA and finalize the FPGA functionality\n\n\n\n466 TELEMETRY, COMMAND, DATA HANDLING AND PROCESSING\n\nlater. In conjunction with desktop PCB design, FPGA technology is increasing the avail-\nable functionality and shortening development timescales for on-board electronic systems.\n\n13.8 TOOLS AND CONTROLLING DOCUMENTS\n\nBecause of the relatively high cost of equipment development and production, the criti-\ncality of the application, and the need to manage risk, it is essential to keep good control\nof the requirements and design. It is also essential to ensure that the solution is properly\nverified at each stage in its life cycle.\n\nIn the data handling and related fields, this is increasingly being achieved using com-\nputer tools such as very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language\n(VHDL), mathematical modelling of digital signal processing, simulation of analogue\nand digital circuits, and auto layout and routing. There are a number of good commercial\nsoftware packages available.\n\nThe definition and control process is also achieved through the use of formal docu-\nmentation such as national and international standards, specification and user manuals,\ntelecommand and telemetry directories, hardware/software interface control documents,\nand electrical and mechanical interface control documents. These are just some examples\nof the documents produced and maintained throughout a product\u2019s life cycle.\n\nSome of the ESA PSS specifications mentioned have been replaced by the European\nCooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) documents or later versions of the CCSDS\ndocuments. Also, the reader needs to be aware that some terminology is evolving, for\nexample, see Reference [2] annex C.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] CCSDS Packet Telemetry , 102.0-B-5 Issue 5 (November 2000).\n[2] CCSDS Space Packet Protocol , 133.0-B-1 Issue 1 (September 2003, TC September 2010).\n[3] CCSDS Advance Orbiting Systems , Networks and Data links, 701.0-B-3 Issue 3 (June 2001).\n[4] CCSDS Space Communications Protocol Specification , 713.0-B-1 Issue 1 (May 1999).\n[5] ECSS Telemetry Synchronisation and Channel Coding , ECSS-E-ST-50-01C Issue 2 (July\n\n2008).\n[6] Packet Telecommand Standard , ESA PS-04-107 Issue 2 (April 1992).\n[7] ECSS Radio Frequency and Modulation , ECSS-E-ST-50-05C Issue 1 rev 1 (March 2009).\n[8] ECSS Ranging and Doppler Tracking , ECSS-E-ST-50-02C Issue 2 (July 2008).\n[9] ECSS SpaceWire Links, Nodes, Routers and Networks , ECSS-E-ST-50-12C Issue 2 (July\n\n2008).\n[10] CCSDS Lossless Data Compression , 121.0-B-1 Issue 1 (May 1997, TC September 2007).\n\nLINKS:\n\nhttp://public.ccsds.org/publications/default.aspx\nhttp://www.ecss.nl/\nhttp://www.ipnsig.org\nhttp://www.irtf.org\n\n\n\n14 GROUND SEGMENT\nFranck Chatel\n\nGerman Space Operations Center (GSOC), Oberpfaffenhofen\n\n14.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ground segment is defined by the European Cooperation for Space Standardization\n(ECSS) institution in Reference [1] as composed of ground operations organizations,\nwhich employ the personnel involved in the mission, and ground systems, that group\ntogether all ground infrastructure required to support the mission from its preparatory\nstage to its completion. Spacecraft operations consist mainly of monitoring telemetry data\nreceived at the ground station and configuring the on-board equipment to execute the\nmission. The fulfilment of these two main tasks implies an intense preparatory phase\nbefore the launch. This comprises not only the design, implementation and test of the\nground segment hardware and software, but also the planning of the operations and the\ntraining of the personnel involved in the mission execution.\n\nSpacecraft operations can be compared to driving a racing car\u2014that is, engineers\ndesign a highly complex product using state of the art technologies to meet the customer\nrequirements. However it is the driver, and the way that they drive the car during the\nrace, that determines the success or otherwise of the endeavour. A final product satisfying\nall of the requirements, but offering poor ergonomics to the driver, is not likely to win\nthe race! Just as it is common practice in car racing to involve the driver at the design\nstage, so it is with spacecraft operations. Operations engineers should be involved in the\ndesign process of the spacecraft as early as possible. The design then benefits greatly from\nthe previous experience of the operations engineers, who would in turn acquire in-depth\nknowledge of the spacecraft that they will operate subsequently.\n\nThis chapter presents the main features of spacecraft operations. It describes the tasks\ncarried out by operations engineers in the preparatory phase and during the mission\nexecution, as well as the hardware and software that are typically implemented. The\norganization and features described below are implemented in a flexible manner. That\nis, each spacecraft mission is unique and requires the ground segment to be tailored to\nits needs, sometimes leaving out some features, sometimes developing new functionali-\nties. For example, what is useful for an Earth-observation mission like ENVISAT is not\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W.

The\norganization adopted depends also upon the available personnel resources. The chapter is\nstructured around the four main systems usually involved in the ground segment:\n\n\u2022 The ground station;\n\u2022 The flight dynamics system;\n\u2022 The ground data system and\n\u2022 The flight operations system.\n\nThis structure focuses on the teams of experts which contribute to the mission, and\nFigure 14.6 provides an overview of how these groups are typically organized. It is a\ncomplementary to the ground segment breakdown used in Reference [1].\n\n14.2 THE GROUND STATION\n\nThe ground station provides the communication interface with the spacecraft. It takes\ncare of all the Radio-Frequency (RF) aspects of the ground segment. The central (and\nmost visible) part of a ground station is the antenna (see Figure 14.1). However the\nprocessing of the RF-signals, either their generation for commanding the spacecraft, or\ntheir demodulation of telemetry (TM) data, plays an equally important role within a\nground station.\n\nFigure 14.1 Weilheim 30 meters antenna (Credit: DLR)\n\n\n\nTHE GROUND STATION 14.2 469\n\n14.2.1 Station location and antennas\n\nAntennas are the communication interface with the spacecraft. The characteristics of the\nmissions which have to be supported determine the type of antenna that is required.\nOperational aspects should be considered in the ground station design.\n\nThe first issue is where the ground station should be located. Since it is supposed to\nexchange data with the control centre, it requires some communications infrastructure\n(e.g. telephone, network etc. - see Section 14.4.2), as well as access to a power supply\nsystem. Although such facilities are readily available in proximity to cities, ground stations\nlocated in remote places (desert, polar region etc.) might lack such infrastructure, thus\nimplying greater cost. Some stations in extremely remote areas, such as the Antarctic,\nmay be controlled remotely, and inspected only during summer time. However, in the\nevent of an anomaly, a service outage of such a ground station is obviously a problem\nand the implementation of redundancy is all the more necessary. An important feature of\nthe antenna characteristics is its horizon mask, which defines the region of the sky within\nwhich the antenna can communicate with the spacecraft. As well as mechanical limitations\nin the way the antenna is mounted, it is obstacles such as surrounding mountains, buildings\nand other antennas that determine the minimum elevation of the antenna, as illustrated in\nFigure 14.2. On the other hand, such topographic features also act as a protection against\nexternal RF interference, coming from airports or other similar radio emitters. Another\nexample of a ground station location at Weilheim, Germany is shown on Figure 14.3\nwhere tracking down to an elevation of 3? is possible.\n\nThe underlying geology at the site is of interest, as a robust and stable foundation is\nrequired when building the antenna, as this impacts the pointing accuracy. The weather\nconditions that prevail throughout the year are also an influential characteristic of the site\nas significant precipitation can affect RF reception, and cloudy skies can inhibit the use\nof Laser Communication Terminals (LCT). The use of the latter has increased in recent\nyears because of the data rates they offer (inf the order of magnitude of one to hundreds\nof gigabits per second).\n\nThe antenna characteristics should also be examined carefully. The frequency at which\nthe antenna operates is dictated by the spacecraft to be supported. This frequency is set by\nthe up- and down-converters (see below) and impacts directly the antenna gain.

Tracking down to three degrees elevation is\npossible (Credit: DLR)\n\nare often carried out in S-band during the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and\nin the case of an emergency (safe mode). However payload data are often transmitted at\nvery high data rates, and therefore require a higher transmit bandwidth than is available\nin S-band. As a consequence, payload operations tend to use higher frequencies (X, Ku or\nKa). In order to reduce the coordination effort at the ground station, payload and platform\nare operated nominally in the same frequency band during the routine phase. Table 14.1\nbelow summarizes the most commonly used frequencies for satellite communications. A\nmore detailed discussion on this topic can be found in Chapter 12.\n\nTable 14.1 Typical RF frequencies used for satellite\ncommunications\n\nBand Frequency (GHz)\n\nDownlink Uplink\n\nS (deep space) 2.29\u20132.30 2.11\u20132.12\nS 2.20\u20132.29 2.025\u20132.11\nC 3.4\u20134.2 5.925\u20136.425\nX 7.25\u20137.75 7.9\u20138.4\n\n8.4\u20138.5 7.145\u20137.235\nKu 10.7\u201312.75 13.75\u201314.5\nKa 17.7\u201321.2 27.5\u201331\n\n25.5\u201327.5\n\n\n\nTHE GROUND STATION 14.2 471\n\nPrecise information about frequency allocations for satellite communication can be\nfound in the frequency allocation plan published by the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU). The use of higher frequencies generally pose greater difficulties, which\nexplains why critical operations like LEOP or emergency modes are still handled using\nS-band. However, it is likely that even these critical operations will be executed using\nhigher frequencies in the near future. It is in the interest of the ground station to be\nable to support as many types of mission as possible. A ground station must apply for\na transmission license from its national telecommunication administration agency, which\nin turn must comply with ITU regulations.\n\nThe diameter of the antenna is directly linked to the surface available to collect the\nsignal emitted by the spacecraft and is a key contributor to the Equivalent Isotropic\nRadiated Power (EIRP) and the ratio of the antenna receive gain to the system noise\ntemperature (G/T) in the link budget (cf. Section 12.2.10). The steering capabilities of the\nantenna mounting are also relevant. Although not important in case of a fixed geostationary\nsatellite, otherwise these capabilities define the operational region of the sky where a\nspacecraft can be tracked. For example, an antenna implemented on an azimuth-elevation\nmounting cannot view a region of sky around the zenith due to mechanical limitations.\nFinally the antenna radiation pattern, showing the strength of the radiated signal in all\ndirections around the antenna, is useful information in the determination of the size of\nthe main lobe (defined by the maximum gain ?3 dB).\n\nThe antenna motion during contact with the spacecraft is controlled by the Antenna\nControl Unit (ACU). Normally the antenna will track the spacecraft as it passes through\nthe visibility area of the ground station. To do so, the antenna can simply point in a\ndirection given by the spacecraft\u2019s ephemeris, describing the orbit, which is computed\noff-line (this is referred to as program tracking). This type of tracking can be extended by\nimplementing a searching motion (for example a spiral) around the spacecraft\u2019s position\nindicated by the ephemeris. This feature is useful when no signal is being received,\nespecially in the case of first acquisition contact. It is possible to improve the tracking by\nmaking the antenna point in the direction where the signal is the strongest. This feature\nis implemented as different modes in the ACU. For example, the auto-tracking mode\nis used with full motion mono-pulse antennas, whereas the step tracking mode is used\nwith fixed position antennas pointed to geostationary satellites. The latter is achieved\nby deviating the antenna through a small angle and comparing the new signal strength\nwith the previous one. This allows the direction in which the antenna should be moved\nto be determined, in order to get the strongest signal. This method is applied on both\naxes of the antenna separately. When an antenna is used in auto-tracking or step tracking\nmode, the measurement of its pointing angles (azimuth and elevation) can be used for\norbit determination.\n\nIf an appropriate transponder is present on-board the spacecraft, the antenna can also\nbe used for ranging and Doppler measurements. Ranging consists of sending a specific\nsignal to the spacecraft receiver, which in turn sends it back as soon as it is received, thus\nallowing the computation of the range using the round-trip time. Doppler measurements\nare obtained by sending a signal with a definite frequency, which is also returned by the\nreceiver at a frequency defined by a fixed ratio of the uplink frequency (the so-called\ncoherent mode to avoid interference with the uplink signal). From the measurement of\nthe downlink frequency, it is possible to compute the Doppler shift, giving access to the\n\n\n\n472 GROUND SEGMENT\n\nradial velocity (also called range-rate). Both range and range-rate measurements are inputs\nfor orbit determination.\n\nAs already mentioned, first acquisition of the spacecraft by the ground station can be\nchallenging. If program tracking is not successful in acquiring the spacecraft, an acqui-\nsition aid antenna could be added in the control loop. This acquisition aid antenna has a\nwide main lobe in its radiation pattern (cf. Section 12.2.8), which allows the scanning of\na wider region of the sky. However, it results in a poorer communications link because\nthe radiated energy is spread over a larger beam. This antenna is therefore used as an aid\nto controlling the pointing of the main dish, which is the dedicated means of communi-\ncation with the spacecraft. After a stable contact has been established, auto-tracking can\nbe initiated.\n\n14.2.2 Data processing\n\nAfter reception of the signal by the antenna, it must be processed further before being\nready to be sent to the control centre. Due to the low received power, the signal needs\nfirst to be amplified by a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA). It is placed as close as possible to\nthe antenna feed to avoid increasing the noise due to cabling. The frequency of the signal\nis then decreased by a down-converter, from the RF carrier level (between 2\u20133 GHz in\nS-band for example) to a so-called intermediate frequency level (usually 70 MHz). This\ndown-converted signal is then processed by the baseband unit , which is the central com-\nponent of the ground station. This unit first converts the signal from analogue to digital,\nand then performs the demodulation, depending on the coding used for communication\n(see Chapter 13). Finally the baseband unit performs the bit synchronization, frame syn-\nchronization and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), if the signal is not encrypted. The\nresult of these operations is a bit stream containing telemetry data that is sent to the\ncontrol centre for further processing (see Section 14.5.1).\n\nFor the task of commanding the spacecraft, the processing is similar. The baseband\nunit receives a bit stream from the Monitoring and Control System (MCS) (see Section\n14.5.1), which is first modulated and converted from a digital signal to an analogue one.\nThis processing is done at the intermediate frequency, and the frequency is then increased\nto the required up-link frequency by the up-converter. Finally the signal is amplified\nusing a High Power Amplifier (HPA), and then radiated by the antenna. These operations\nrequire a reference frequency, provided either by a reference oscillator or directly from\na time source (e.g. GPS). The baseband unit usually provides the possibility to store and\nreplay some commands generated at the control centre for testing purposes. It is also\nable to replay saved telemetry data, emulating a real-time contact. Figure 14.4 shows the\nrelationship between these units.\n\nThe data processing chain of the ground station must be tested for compatibility with\nthe spacecraft, which is the objective of the RF-compatibility test . This is executed either\nwith the spacecraft itself or, more often, with the aid of a \u2018RF-suitcase\u2019 delivered by the\nspacecraft manufacturer, which simulates the characteristics of the spacecraft at RF level.\nThis suitcase is then used at each ground station involved in the mission. It is connected\nimmediately after the feed system of the ground station antenna. The atmospheric losses\nare simulated by attenuators and a telemetry signal which emulates the spacecraft is\ninjected into the processing chain. This test signal is then processed as if it were a\nreal signal coming from the spacecraft.

Commands are also sent which are representative of those used during the\nmission, and the reception of the correct bit pattern in the RF-suitcase is verified.\n\nDuring the mission, prior to a pass of the spacecraft over the ground station, the orbital\nephemeris of the spacecraft are loaded into the antenna control unit, the HPAs are warmed-\nup and a data-flow test is performed between the control centre and the ground station.\nTelemetry data are replayed at the ground station and transmitted to the control centre for\nprocessing. The control centre then sends some test commands to the antenna switched to\na dummy load, dissipating the power into heat (in order to avoid actually radiating these\ncommands). Both of these tests ensure the correct configuration of the communication\nlink, the ground station equipment and the control centre for the up-coming contact.\nDuring the contact, the antenna exchanges data with the spacecraft from Acquisition of\nSignal (AOS) to Loss of Signal (LOS). These data are directly transmitted to the control\ncentre but also archived in case the communication link is interrupted. Pointing angles\n(if auto-tracking mode is used), ranging and Doppler data are not transmitted in real-time\nbut as off-line products. After LOS, the antenna is brought back to its parking position.\nAll of these activities are overseen by a monitoring and control system dedicated to the\nground station, the functionalities of which are similar to the one used for the mission\nexecution at the control centre.\n\n14.2.3 In-Orbit Tests for telecommunication missions\n\nIn-Orbit Tests (IOT) of spacecraft are performed to verify the compliance of the on-board\ninstruments with their specification, and to ensure that they have not been degraded during\nthe launch phase. IOT campaigns also allow the measurement of the characteristics of\nthese instruments, and are often repeated throughout the mission to assess performance\ndegradations. Of course, the kind of tests performed depends on the mission type (Earth-\nobservation, astronomy, telecommunication etc.) and each requires different equipments.\nFor example, one of the calibration tests for a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is done with\nreflectors on ground, which are arranged in a cross shape, thus allowing the measurement\nof distortion in the acquired image. This section however focuses on the In-Orbit Tests\nfor telecommunication missions because these particularly involve the ground station.\nChapter 12 gives a good overview of the typical performance factors measured on\ncommunication satellites and these tests will not be described here.\n\nA ground station involved in an IOT campaign requires outstanding levels of perfor-\nmance to allow the verification of the payload requirements. Not only must absolute values\nbe recorded, but also their stability in time. Measurement uncertainties must be compati-\nble with the required accuracy. IOT measurements also make use of specific equipments,\nsuch as, for example, a spectrum analyser used in the characterization of Adjacent Satel-\nlite Interference (ASI). All these equipments are integrated together in portable racks, and\na software program is used to automate the data acquisition and generation of reports.\nDue to these special features, such a ground station is normally not involved in the daily\nactivities of spacecraft operations. The capability of an IOT ground station to support the\ntest campaign adequately must be demonstrated during acceptance tests, and the measured\nperformance is used to establish the IOT specification. For example, the determination\nof the Input Power Flux Density (IPFD) at saturation can be limited by the EIRP of the\nground station.\n\n\n\nFLIGHT DYNAMICS 14.3 475\n\nThe methodology used during IOT must be carefully planned. Many factors influence\nthe measurements, and each of them must be taken into account to get a meaningful\nresult. For example, the interference coming from the uplink and downlink signals of\nneighbouring satellites have to be characterized so that its influence can be taken into\naccount in the test measurements. The IOT campaign is performed as far as possible at\nthe final on-station position of the satellite, but such interference might impose the need to\nmove the spacecraft to another orbital location to perform the testing. The influence of the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere (cf. Section 12.2.7) also plays an important role, especially for Ku or\nKa-band payloads, and it is necessary to get daily weather forecasts during the campaign.\nSome tests (e.g. gain measurements) might even be postponed if clear sky conditions\nare not available or wind speeds are too high. The pointing of the satellite platform is\nalso relevant since it impacts the spacecraft\u2019s antenna pointing, and some measurements\ncannot be performed during station-keeping manoeuvres. This influence of the platform\nattitude is nevertheless useful in mapping the antenna pattern; instead of having many\nground stations measuring the signal strength, the platform can be rotated and the entire\npattern mapped with a single station. Finally coverage corrections for the projection of\nthe beam onto the Earth\u2019s surface, and corrections due to degradation have also to be\ntaken into account.\n\n14.3 FLIGHT DYNAMICS\n\nFlight dynamics experts deal with all aspects of the mission related to the spacecraft\norbit and attitude. During the preparatory phase, they are mostly involved in the mission\nanalysis. Based on this analysis, they supply experts from other systems (ground station,\nground data and flight operations) with products containing predicted orbital informa-\ntion (called operational products) to support their preparation. During the mission, flight\ndynamics experts perform orbit and attitude determinations to control the actual execution\nand deliver updates of the operational products. Finally flight dynamics provides services\nrelated to space awareness and collision avoidance.\n\n14.3.1 Mission analysis and operational products\n\nFlight dynamics experts perform the mission analysis in close liaison with the satellite\nmanufacturer. This relationship is essential to ensure that all mission requirements are met,\nand to allow negotiation concerning whether and how some requirements may be loosened\nif necessary. Mission analysis is discussed in detail in Chapter 5, so this chapter will only\noutline the main outputs required by the ground segment. These can be summarized as:\n\n\u2022 The identification of the network of ground stations that satisfies the mission require-\nments in terms of ground coverage. This network is typically global and dense during\nthe early orbit phase, the focus of which is to check that the spacecraft systems are\noperating normally, and to ensure that orbit manoeuvres (if necessary) are performed\ncorrectly to reach the final orbit. The choice of the first acquisition station must be\nconsidered carefully, as the first contact with the spacecraft is a critical part of the\nmission. The distance between the launcher separation point and the first acquisition\nstation, the quality of the delivered tracking data and the availability of an acquisition\n\n\n\n476 GROUND SEGMENT\n\naid antenna are some of the criteria to be taken into account when making this choice.\nAfter spacecraft commissioning and the commencement of routine operations, the\nground station network is reduced to a few stations. This network forms the basis\nfor the preparatory phase of the ground data system.\n\n\u2022 The launch window determination taking into account requirements in terms of final\norbit and manoeuvre planning. It is usually computed over many months around\nthe planned launch date to cope with launch delays. This output is delivered to the\nlaunch provider, and discussions might arise if there is a co-passenger.\n\n\u2022 The orbit manoeuvre planning (if required by the mission) to reach the final orbit\nfrom the transfer orbit. A tree of backup strategies is also computed in case one of\nthe manoeuvres cannot be performed as planned.\n\nThe strategies for final orbit acquisition and station keeping also come under the\numbrella of mission analysis and its main outputs. They are however very dependent\non the mission (formation flying, rendezvous, interplanetary mission, GEO, and so on).\nIn the case when orbit manoeuvres are required, the orbit acquisition strategy can only be\nfinalized after completion of the orbit determination following the last manoeuvre. This\nis due to the dispersions in the main engine thrust, as well as modelling errors. Apart\nfrom these main outputs, several more specialized operational products are generated from\nthe mission analysis. These operational products are of course mission specific but the\nfollowing are typical:\n\n\u2022 A list of orbit related events . This is the basis for the mission planning (see Section\n14.5.4). It identifies events in chronological order. For example, such events are\neclipse entry and exit, apoapsis and periapsis crossings and sensor blinding by the\nSun or Moon.\n\n\u2022 Ground station events . This is similar to the orbit related events but focused on\nthe ground segment. For example, events of interest are acquisition and loss of\nsignal (AOS/LOS) and RF sun interference (when the sun is close to the station-\nspacecraft line).\n\n\u2022 Ground station ephemeris . This has to be generated for each ground station in the\nnetwork. It provides information (the azimuth and elevation angles) to point the\nantenna during a spacecraft pass in program-track mode.\n\nAll these operational products are specified in Interface Control Documents (ICD). Of\ncourse, at this stage these products are only theoretical, being based on tools making use\nof gravitational field or engine performance models. The update of these products during\nthe mission is the topic of the next section.\n\nAnother category of operational products to be specified are command and telemetry\nfiles that are exchanged between flight dynamics and flight operations during the mission\nexecution. Telemetry files contain measurements related to the sensors and actuators (GPS\nposition and velocity, attitude quaternion from star sensors, earth sensor roll and pitch\nangles, wheel speeds, etc) down-linked by the spacecraft and these are used as inputs for\norbit and attitude determinations. Based on these files, flight dynamics also computes the\nvalues of some parameters that must be up-linked to the spacecraft. Such parameter values\nare delivered to the flight operations team in the form of command files ready to be loaded\ninto the monitoring and control system. Typical examples of command files are on-board\norbit propagator parameters, orbit manoeuvre parameters such as ?Vs, quaternions for\n\n\n\nFLIGHT DYNAMICS 14.3 477\n\nspacecraft re-orientation into manoeuvre attitude, gyroscope drift after a calibration or\nequipment misalignment.\n\nThe tools used for the mission analysis are implemented in the flight dynamics system\nthat will be used during the mission, together with the ones for processing telemetry\nand generating command files. The preparation of this system for the mission some-\ntimes requires the development of specific tools (depending on the type of mission\nactivities\u2014formation flying, rendezvous, high accuracy orbit determination, etc.) and\ntheir testing.\n\n14.3.2 Orbit and attitude determination\n\nAs pointed out in the previous section, the operational products generated during the\npreparatory phase are based on theoretical models. The actual mission performance differs\neither slightly when operations are nominal or dramatically in the case of an anomaly.\nAn update of these operational products is then required.\n\nThe first opportunity for update comes during the launch phase or immediately after sep-\naration. Based on actual launcher performance (mostly the lift-off time and the computed\norbital elements of the transfer orbit, which are both delivered by the launch provider),\nflight dynamics experts have to decide, or not, to update the ephemeris of the first acqui-\nsition ground station. It is a critical decision that has to be taken possibly before AOS\n(usually due within the next minutes) or worse still, during the first contact! This update\nwill determine whether the spacecraft can be successfully tracked during the first contact,\nwhich is very important. It is usually the case that the tracking of the spacecraft based on\nthe orbital elements provided by the launcher becomes increasingly difficult. If the first\nacquisition is to take place a significant time after the separation, tracking data using an\naid antenna might help bridge the gap. In the last resort, the two-line orbital elements\nprovided by the US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM, formerly known as NORAD)\ncan be used. Unfortunately the availability of the first such set of orbital elements can\nvary from a few hours to several days after launch!\n\nAnother opportunity for the update of operational products is a non-nominal sequence\nof the launcher, leading to the spacecraft being released into an orbit different to that\ntargeted. In such an event, the operational products of all ground stations need to be\nupdated immediately to ensure they are capable of tracking the spacecraft. When the\nlauncher performance is not nominal, the orbit perigee is often too low, which may force\nthe performance of an orbit manoeuvre as soon as possible to avoid the denser parts of\nthe atmosphere. This requires the computation of a completely new manoeuvre planning\nstrategy and, as a consequence, the re-planning of all subsequent operations.\n\nImmediately after the first successful contact, the flight dynamics experts can begin\nwith their major task during the mission, namely that of orbit determination . This may\nbe based on a variety of data types, depending on the kind of measurements available\non the mission. For example, down-linked GPS data if the spacecraft is equipped with a\nGPS receiver, range and range-rate data gathered at the ground station in the case of an\non-board transponder supporting these measurements, or simply tracking data comprised\nof antenna angles if the dish is in auto-track mode. An overview of orbit determination\nmethods can be found in References [2] and [3]. Measurements are required over at\nleast one complete orbit revolution, with a good global distribution to get a reliable\n\n\n\n478 GROUND SEGMENT\n\nTable 14.2 Typical accuracies from orbit determination methods\n\nOrbit Type Used measurement type Position accuracy (m)\n\nLEO Angle data < 100\nGPS navigation solution data < 10\nGPS raw data (single frequency receiver) < 2\nGPS raw data (dual frequency receiver) < 0.01\n\nGTO/GEO Angle, range, range-rate data x , y : <100, z : <400\n\ndetermination. Typical accuracies of orbit determination using different measurements\nmethods are given in Table 14.2.\n\nOrbit determination is required after each orbit manoeuvre. The comparison of the\norbital elements prior and after the manoeuvre allows the determination of the ?V actually\nachieved during the burn. The difference between this and the planned ?V is used to\ndetermine a calibration factor (usually applied to the thrust level) that can be taken into\naccount in the planning of the next manoeuvre. Sometimes computing this calibration\nfactor is complicated by the fact that spacecraft attitude is controlled by thrusters, which\nalso contributes to the overall ?V. Although it is possible to filter some of the thruster\ncontribution by performing measurements at well chosen times (for example just before\nthe thrusters firing), the thrust contribution resulting from the attitude control during the\nmanoeuvre can only be separated by a more precise analysis. After orbit determination,\nan update of the operational products is delivered to all parties. The manoeuvre planning\nis eventually updated as well.\n\nSimilar to orbit determination, the attitude determination is also the responsibility of\nthe flight dynamicists during the mission. Measurements depend on the sensors and actu-\nators implemented on-board the spacecraft\u2019s attitude control system (see Section 9.2).\nReference [4] presents a useful review of methodologies. The result of the attitude deter-\nmination can be used in the preparation of attitude manoeuvres, in the same way that orbit\ndetermination can be used for orbit manoeuvre planning. It is also used to calibrate some\nequipment (gyroscopes for example) or verify the proper functioning of the on-board\npointing algorithm.\n\n14.3.3 Space situational awareness and collision avoidance\n\nOperating a spacecraft safely requires knowledge of the threats posed by the space envi-\nronment. The characteristics of the space environment is treated at Chapter 2 and shows\nthat these threats originate either from the natural environment (Earth atmosphere, solar\nand cosmic radiations, meteoroids etc) or from the consequences of space utilization\nby humans (active spacecraft or space debris). Acknowledging the need to have reli-\nable information in this domain, the European Space Agency (ESA) started the Space\nSituational Awareness (SSA) programme in November 2008. It aims to monitor all\nEarth orbiting objects (satellites and debris) as well as the space environment (so called\nspace weather).\n\nThe ever increasing number of satellites and space debris in near-Earth space is causing\ngrowing concern about the risk of collision between orbiting objects. This risk is enhanced\n\n\n\nFLIGHT DYNAMICS 14.3 479\n\nFigure 14.5 Earth-orbiting objects on 17th of February 2010 compiled from the entire\nUSSTRATCOM TLE catalogue (14137 objects at the epoch mentioned) (Credit: DLR)\n\nin certain popular operational orbits such as GEO (where most telecommunications assets\ncan be found) and sun-synchronous LEOs which accommodate many Earth observation\nspacecraft. A schematic of the current debris environment is shown in Figure 14.5.\n\nAlthough the cross-section of a single spacecraft is extremely small compared to the\navailable volume, the collision of Iridium 33 with Kosmos 2251 on 10th February 2009\n(the first ever between two intact catalogued objects), reminds us that the risk must not\nbe underestimated. The accuracy with which close encounters of spacecraft with other\nobjects (spacecraft or debris) can be predicted depends upon the accuracy of their orbital\nparameters. The USSTRATCOM catalogue of Two-Lines Elements (TLE) is the only\npublic source of information available about orbiting objects. Unfortunately, their quality\nis limited and some military satellites are not included in the catalogue (which is why\nthe ESA SSA programme has been established). Consequently, close encounter predic-\ntions, taking into account the data accuracy, might be too pessimistic and lead to a high\nnumber of warnings. Any unnecessary collision avoidance manoeuvre results in a loss\nof operational lifetime (increased fuel consumption), service interruption and a possible\nloss of science data. In the event of a potential collision warning, it becomes necessary\nto refine the orbit knowledge of the other object by implementing a tracking campaign\nbased on ground radar stations. This allows the refinement of the necessary orbital infor-\nmation, and eventually the implementation of an evasive manoeuvre (if necessary) in\ndue time.\n\nSpace weather must also be monitored carefully. The activity of the Sun is closely\nmonitored by many satellites (SOHO, ACE, GOES and POES satellites, for example)\nand ground stations. Disturbance of the Earth magnetic field, radiation storms and radio\ndisturbances can be forecast and the flight operations team can decide to suspend the\nspacecraft activities during such events. In some cases, the spacecraft can even be re-\noriented to present a less-sensitive face to the Sun.\n\n\n\n480 GROUND SEGMENT\n\nFlight Dynamics System\n\nControl Center\n\nCustomer\n\nGround Station\n\nCommunication\nlinks\n\nRF-link\n\nGround Data System\n\nFlight Operations System\n\nFigure 14.6 A simplified overview of the ground segment (Credit: DLR)\n\n14.4 THE GROUND DATA SYSTEM\n\nGround data system personnel take care of the ground segment infrastructure required\nto support the operations. This infrastructure can be seen schematically as a spacecraft\ncontrol centre, hosting the flight operations and flight dynamics systems, interfaced to\nthe ground station network and the organization representing the customer, as pictured\non Figure 14.6. The exchange of data within the control centre or with external sites\nis done via communication links. Spacecraft specific implementation and testing of the\nwhole ground segment is necessary to ensure its proper functioning.\n\n14.4.1 The control centre and network infrastructure\n\nThe control centre hosts all personnel and infrastructure involved in the mission. Some-\ntimes the same infrastructure is shared by many different missions (a multi-mission control\ncentre). The first obvious consequence is that many computers need to be accommodated\ntogether and combined into a network. As a consequence, a thermal control system is\nrequired within the centre to dissipate the heat generated. This problem is further exacer-\nbated by the redundancy requirement of critical function hardware, such as the monitoring\nand control server or the data archive server. The redundancy switching is often performed\nautonomously to avoid human intervention and to optimize the system availability. All the\ndata in the control centre is backed-up periodically (every day) to avoid any loss. For pre-\ncise timing applications, all computers are synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time\n(UTC), which is distributed over the control centre network. The public power supply is\noften a single point of failure and it is necessary to install an Uninterrupted Power Supply\n(UPS) based on a separate source (for example, a generator driving a battery system) to\nbridge possible outages until public grid electricity is available again. The switching to\nthe secondary power supply is controlled autonomously by software.\n\nRunning a control centre requires dedicated teams for network administration and\ninfrastructure maintenance. Computers are usually running continuously, which puts a\nheavy load on the hardware. This requires carefully planned maintenance and replacement\nstrategies, especially taking into account delivery delays and spare-parts management.\nStandardization of equipment throughout the control centre is certainly good practice.\nIn general, maintenance activities should not impact running operations. However, long\n\n\n\nTHE GROUND DATA SYSTEM 14.4 481\n\nmissions (20 years in GEO for example) are a challenge with respect to maintenance,\nbecause mission tools do not evolve much in the routine mission phase. Consequently\nthe same computer hardware and software needs to be maintained over a long period of\ntime, together with the system knowledge. The emergence of virtualization techniques,\nwhere the hardware and software of a virtual machine are entirely emulated at software\nlevel on a host machine, can help in solving such problems.\n\nConsideration of security is becoming more important as a requirement. It aims at\nensuring the confidentiality, the integrity and availability of mission data, both during the\npreparation and execution phases of the spacecraft mission. Security impacts the entire\nmission and, as such, needs to be taken into account from the very beginning. Each mission\nis different, but usually there are similarities. The security considerations begin with the\ninstallation of separated Local Area Networks (LAN), protected by firewalls to restrict\nthe access to sensitive data. Personal login user names and passwords are required on\neach computer, and personnel must be cleared through governmental agencies to handle\nclassified material. This may pose problems for system administrators, who must have\naccess to all machines and data. Emails and exchange of data in general are encrypted,\nwhich supposes that the functionalities required to do this are available. Control of access\nto sensitive areas (server or control rooms) is required together, with logging functions\n(listings of who accesses which areas or machines) and video surveillance. The telemetry\nand commands are often encrypted, which impacts both the spacecraft and the MCS.\nThis must be taken into account by dedicated processes on the ground. Special attention\nmust be given to security methods because it could threaten the mission if not correctly\nimplemented. Finally, it is important to make the control centre personnel aware of this,\nthrough the use of dedicated training sessions.\n\nDocumentation related to the control centre design is essential, especially for long-term\nmissions when changes in personnel occur periodically. This documentation is reviewed\nat the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR).\n\n14.4.2 Communication links\n\nOperations require the smooth interaction of people and systems. Communication links\nbetween the ground stations and the control centre, communications within the control\ncentre itself and with the customer, are the \u2018glue\u2019 of the mission, without which day-to-day\nfunctioning of the overall system would not be possible.\n\nThe most obvious need for a communication link is between the ground station and\nthe control centre, through which telemetry data is forwarded from the antenna to the\nMCS. Command data obviously moves in the opposite sense, to be radiated to the space-\ncraft. All these data are usually carried by leased ISDN lines, although sometimes the\ninternet is used as the medium. The process may include a data relay satellite. The com-\nmunications lines are shared by different missions, unless the customer requires dedicated\nlines. Attention must be paid to the data format\u2014so called \u2018gateways\u2019 are often required\nfor protocol conversion and this implies extra effort in the development and testing.\nThe recommendation of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)\nconcerning Space Link Extension (SLE) Services [5] acknowledges the need for standard-\nization in this domain and proposes some new concepts to improve the interoperability\nbetween ground segments. The customer or the spacecraft manufacturer may also request\nto receive spacecraft telemetry from the launch pad to perform a last health check. Other\n\n\n\n482 GROUND SEGMENT\n\ncommon requests prior to launch are command tests, and the reception of the television\nof the launch by the launch agency (if available) or at least images of the launch.\n\nAnother use of the communication links is the delivery of operational products to the\ndifferent partners involved in the operations. Together with the data discussed in Section\n14.3.1, that are directly used to run the operations, scientific data or images may need\nto be extracted from the archive and transferred to the customer or to other control\ncentres for further processing. Data transfer is also complicated by security measures.\nA specific tool is usually used to automate these transfers between well defined pick-up\nand delivery points.\n\nApart from all data exchanged between machines, people are always involved in the\noperations and there is no better way to exchange information than by using the medium\nwe are all accustomed to in our day-to-day lives - voice. A voice conference system with\ndifferent channels (called voice loops), is often implemented at the control centre and\nthe ground stations. It allows the different groups of personnel involved in the operations\nto speak with each other and to hear what is currently going on. All people taking part\nin the operations must have permission to talk and/or listen on the different channels,\ndepending upon their involvement. As a backup, regular phones are also used within the\ncontrol centre and external phone lines, independent of the regular private communication\nnetwork, might be available to bridge service outages. Finally fax machines are required\nto transmit signed documents. This is particularly important during the launch phase,\nwhen the launch provider needs to confirm the lift-off time, the separation time and the\norbital elements of the transfer orbits by written means for clarity.\n\nAll these communication links must be documented in the ground segment description,\nbut more importantly in interface control documents. Ground procedures, similar to flight\noperations procedures (see Section 14.5.3) need to be developed and validated for config-\nuration tasks and redundancy switching. This documentation is reviewed during the PDR\nand CDR. A more detailed overview of the ground segment documentation can be found\nin Reference [6].\n\n14.4.3 Configuration management and testing\n\nThe ground system required for the mission is complex and its preparation requires similar\ntechniques to that used for satellite product assurance (see Chapter 19).\n\nAt the beginning of the mission, ground system requirements are defined in terms of\nfacilities and software. At the same time, an overall test plan is issued, which describes\nthe way in which these requirements will be verified. Different methods can be used\nfor this verification which include inspection, analysis or testing. The overall test plan\nis then broken down into several test specifications focused on a particular sub-system\n(for example, acceptance testing performed on operational machines) or at system level\n(integration tests including the interfaces between subsystems). Test specifications are\ndelivered with test procedures, detailing exactly the steps needed to verify the require-\nments. Prior to testing, a Test Readiness Review (TRR) is held with all persons involved\nin the test, under the supervision of a Test Review Board (TRB). The TRR ensures that\nthe product is under configuration control, that its documentation is available, that the test\nis correctly documented and that a deviation reporting procedure is in place. Finally a\ntest report is issued, summarizing all deviations, the \u2018as-run\u2019 test procedures (that is, with\n\n\n\nTHE FLIGHT OPERATIONS SYSTEM 14.5 483\n\ncomments added during the test) and the conclusion of the TRB stating the outcome. A\nreview of all the test results takes place at the Qualification Review (QR).\n\nManaging such a complex system as a control centre cannot be done without a proper\nconfiguration management process of all operational parts (hardware, software, flight\nprocedures, database, and so on). The tracing of the installation status is important. As\ndiscrepancies are reported during tests or simulations, an update of some tools is often\nnecessary, prompting some new tests, and the integration of the new tools into the over-\nall system. Special processes like a Non-Conformance Report (NCR) in the case of an\nanomaly or an Engineering Change Request (ECR) in the case of a required change\nensure that each problem is documented and that all changes are traceable, thus allow-\ning a mechanism for correction. As the preparation for the mission progresses, changes\nwill always be more critical to implement, due to the risk of impacting other parts of\nthe system. Finally, shortly before launch, the system is frozen and changes can only be\nimplemented after the agreement of a special board involving all parties responsible. In\na multi-mission control centre, this impacts the resources shared with other missions.\n\n14.5 THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS SYSTEM\n\nThe flight operations team is in charge of conducting the operations, which consist mainly\nof commanding the spacecraft and monitoring its telemetry data. Both these tasks are per-\nformed with the help of the monitoring and control system, which processes telemetry and\ncommand data in near real time and archives them. Operations are based on flight oper-\nations procedures, which describe the way in which the spacecraft is to be commanded,\nand the mission planning describing when they are to be executed.\n\n14.5.1 The monitoring and control system\n\nThe monitoring and control system is the heart of the operations. On the telemetry side,\nit processes the bit stream generated at the ground station and transmitted to the control\ncentre. It also presents these processed data to the flight operations team in a meaningful\nway. On the command side, it translates the orders from the operators into a bit stream that\nthe spacecraft can interpret. Details about telemetry and command encoding technologies\nare given in Chapter 13 and the term \u2018bit stream\u2019 is used in this chapter to avoid being\ntoo specific about the technology.\n\nThe processing of telemetry data involves the following steps:\n\n\u2022 Extraction of the raw value of each telemetry parameter from the bit stream. This is\ndone with the knowledge of the parameter\u2019s first bit location and its bit length.\n\n\u2022 Translation of the raw value into an engineering value. Polynomials or linear inter-\npolation between predefined points are often used as translational aids. A discrete\nstatus is calibrated using tables (0 = OFF, 1 = ON for example).\n\n\u2022 Verification of the validity of the parameter . Parameter specific validity conditions\n(as opposed to the overall validity of the bit stream verified with the CRC) can be\ndefined. For example, a reading associated with a particular item of equipment can\nbe flagged invalid when this equipment is switched off. This is useful, for example,\nin situations where the last value received from the unit is down-linked although the\nunit itself is not delivering any more data.\n\n\n\n484 GROUND SEGMENT\n\n\u2022 Computation of out-of-limit status . Equipments are tested on the ground, where their\nproper functioning is ensured under different conditions (qualification and acceptance\ntesting). In order to avoid using the equipment in untested conditions, which may\nresult in damage, limits are defined on the values delivered. The first limit stage,\ncalled soft alarm or warning , signals that the evolution of this value must be moni-\ntored closely and might reach potentially dangerous levels. The second limit stage,\ncalled hard alarm , signals that the value has reached a potentially dangerous level,\nwhere a corrective action must be undertaken. It is also possible to define so-called\ndelta-limits on the difference between two consecutive values.\n\n\u2022 Derived parameters . These are parameters computed from the values of other param-\neters (raw or engineering). The MCS usually proposes a set of mathematical functions\nfor this purpose.\n\nOnce the telemetry data have been processed, a display system (sometimes integrated\ninto the MCS) presents the data to the flight operations engineers. The basic types of\ndisplay pages are alphanumeric, where parameters are listed together with their description\nand value, as well as graphical , where the value of a parameter is plotted against time\nor the value of another parameter. Apart from these types, alarm displays summarize\nthe parameters with out-of-limit conditions and synoptics give a graphical overview of\na subsystem. Three-dimensional animations controlled by telemetry parameters can also\nbe used, although this is not yet commonly-used. The three basic types of display are\nillustrated in Figure 14.7.\n\nThe processing of command data is similar to that of telemetry data. The display\nfunction takes the form of command queues (an example is shown in Figure 14.8), which\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 14.7 Example of display pages. Alphanumeric (a), graphical (b) and synoptic (c)\n(Credit: DLR)\n\n\n\nTHE FLIGHT OPERATIONS SYSTEM 14.5 485\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 14.7 Continued\n\nare lists of commands that can be executed manually (using functions like delete, load,\nmove, insert, modify). The command process is performed directly from the command\nqueue either manually by sending them one by one, batched together or automatically.\nDepending on the technology used at the ground station and on-board the spacecraft,\nsome information about the command processing (radiation acknowledgement, on-board\nreception and execution) is returned to the MCS, which can display these different stages.\nThere are two additional important functions in the command process. The first is the\nPre-Telemetry Verification (PTV)\u2014this ensures that the values of a list of telemetry\nparameters must be within a specified range before the command can be sent. The second\nis the Command Execution Verification (CEV), which checks that a list of telemetry\nparameters are within a specified range to indicate that the command execution has been\n\n\n\n486 GROUND SEGMENT\n\nFigure 14.8 Example of a command queue as implemented in the MCS SCOS-2000\n(SCOS-2000 is a monitoring and control system developed by ESA) (Credit: DLR)\n\nsuccessful. These two functions are safety measures that can be overridden if necessary.\nCommanding the spacecraft is usually performed using the Communications Operation\nProcedure-1 (COP-1) as recommended by the CSSDS in Reference [7]. When using this\nprocedure, commands are sent either in expedited service (By-pass Data or BD service),\nwhere they are transmitted only once, or in sequence-controlled service (Acceptance\ncheck Data or AD service), which implements a retransmission mechanism ensuring that\nno command is lost, duplicated or delivered out of sequence.\n\nAll the information required by the MCS is stored in a database, which is delivered\nby the spacecraft manufacturer to the flight operations team with proper documentation.\nThis is the source of a potential conflict that should not be underestimated. The spacecraft\nmanufacturer uses the database with its own system for ground testing. On the other hand,\nthe flight operations system might use another MCS with a different database structure.\nThe decision to convert the database to the MCS format already in use at the control\ncentre must be weighed carefully against the risk and cost of conversion or adaptation.\nHowever, using the MCS of the spacecraft manufacturer implies that the operations team\nwill require additional training so that it acquires the required proficiency. Tools to manage\nthe database (editing, version control, and so on) are also required. Some efforts are\nbeing made by the Object Management Group (OMG) to specify an information model\nfor telemetry data and commands in order to standardize the exchange of databases.\nThe resulting XML Telemetric and Command Exchange (XTCE) became the topic of a\nCCSDS recommendation (see Reference [8]) and may help in improving the situation.\n\n14.5.2 Archiving and off-line processing\n\nTelemetry data processing is usually performed in near real-time - that is to say that\nthere are only a few seconds delay between the data generation on-board and its process-\ning on the ground. This is the case for geostationary satellites or more generally other\nEarth-orbiting satellites when visible from a ground station. Near real-time processing is\n\n\n\nTHE FLIGHT OPERATIONS SYSTEM 14.5 487\n\nhowever not always possible in the case of an interplanetary mission or when the satellite\nhas no immediate ground contact. Data are then usually stored on-board and dumped,\ntogether with current real-time data, during a contact with a ground station. These data\nare processed \u2018off-line\u2019 (as opposed to near real-time processing). The same MCS may\nbe used to process both real-time and off-line telemetry data, especially if merging is\nrequired. However, science data can also be processed using a different system in a\ndifferent control centre.\n\nAll data down-linked from, or up-linked to the spacecraft must be permanently archived,\nincluding off-line processed data that has to be merged with the real-time data. The\ntemporal ordering of the data in such an archive is usually done using the on-board time\n(the time defined by the spacecraft\u2019s computer), especially if off-line data are present.\nAttention must be paid when a time reset occurs, for example after a reboot of the on-\nboard computer, or when the on-board time is implemented as a counter (for example an\ninteger increased every second and coded using a limited number of bits). In the latter\ncase, the counter may exceed its maximum value and is then set back to zero (\u2018wrap-up\u2019).\nSometimes, in the case of continuous ground contact, the Earth-Received Time (ERT) (the\ntime given by the ground station baseband unit at the reception of the telemetry data) is\nused to avoid these problems. The commands are archived directly by the MCS, using\nthe server time, usually synchronized with UTC.\n\nThe definition of an archive system also dictates at which stage data must be archived.\nThe raw bit stream may be temporarily archived at the ground station to avoid losing it\nwhen the communication link between the station and the control centre is down. The\nground station can usually replay these data, thus allowing the MCS to process them\nnormally (but delayed in time of course). The raw bit stream can also be archived before\nbeing processed by the MCS. The data must then be reprocessed prior to further use, but\nthis can be difficult if the satellite manufacturer uses another system or if cryptography\nis used to code the data between the MCS and the spacecraft. Another possibility is to\narchive only the engineering data after processing by the MCS. In this case, access is\nfaster but data can only be accessed by the MCS. The solution adopted depends entirely\non the mission, and several archives are usually used.\n\nArchived data are only useful if they can be easily accessed. The first possibility is data\nreplay within the MCS. Data are simply played-back continuously or step by step, and\nparameter values are displayed as if in real-time by the display system. This is particularly\nuseful for precise analysis of an anomaly. The display of the command queue during the\nplayback is an asset allowing a full picture of the situation. This function is also used to\ncompile the mission report for the customer.\n\nAnother possibility to access the archived data is telemetry extraction. This functionality\nallows the extraction of values of parameters between a start and a stop time. It is used\nto generate products to be transferred to other groups, such as the flight dynamics team\nor the scientific community, who may use different data analysis tools.\n\nAlthough the MCS offers the possibility to define derived parameters, this is often not\nsufficient to support complex analysis. Derived parameters are well adapted for simple\ncomputations performed in near real-time, and are used to support the operations, but they\nare not suitable for other purposes. Complex analysis requiring advanced visualization of\nparameters, frequency analysis (Fourier\u2019s transform), or complex orbital calculations are\nbetter done with external tools. These are referred to as off-line tools . They clearly depend\non the mission and can be specified by the satellite manufacturer if they are to be used\n\n\n\n488 GROUND SEGMENT\n\nduring the operations. A typical example of an off-line tool is the fuel mass calculation\nderived from the on-time and pulse count of the thrusters. Such tools will of course be\nspecifically developed and tested.\n\n14.5.3 Flight procedures and validation\n\nDue to the high cost and complexity of a spacecraft, there is no place in spacecraft\noperations for improvization. Many constraints, either at sub-system level (equipment\ntemperatures, warm-up times, fields of view, and so on) or at system level (power bal-\nance, available memory, angular momentum, and so on), need to be taken into account\nwhen commanding the spacecraft. All the relevant information must consequently be\nsummarized in flight operations procedures that are executed during the mission.\n\nA flight operations procedure can be seen as a list of steps in chronological order,\nitemizing the actions to be performed. The two basic functions are the verification of\ntelemetry parameters and the verification of commands. The former comprises a check of\ntheir code in the MCS database and the expected value or range (e.g. \u2018verify AU50K<50\u2019),\nand the latter a check of their code and the value of associated parameters (for example\n\u2018send 01MAH, Dirpg_nb = 2\u2019 would correspond to line 1 of the command stack shown on\nFigure 14.8). Other actions are typically ground segment configuration tasks (\u2018configure\nMCS to use COP-1 AD service\u2019 for example - see Section 14.5.1) or calls to execute other\nflight procedures. These actions might be embedded in branching conditions (e.g. \u2018if-then-\nelse\u2019). An important characteristic is the timing of the steps with respect to main events\n(for example \u2018boost start minus 5 min\u2019), which gives a guideline with respect to timing\nof the execution, providing a basis for mission planning. Based on these procedures, files\ncontaining the relevant commands are generated, and these files are loaded in the MCS\nwhen the procedure is to be executed.\n\nFlight procedures need to cover not only all nominal activities expected during the entire\nmission, but also a set of well-chosen contingency cases. It is not realistic to develop a\ncontingency procedure for all possible single and multiple failures. However, all cases\nwhere the mission could be endangered without a swift reaction need to be considered,\nand a contingency procedure developed. The advantage of having such procedures is that\ntheir proper functioning has been validated beforehand, and that command files have been\nprepared and are ready to be loaded in the MCS. The experience of the flight operations\nteam is a valuable asset in defining these contingency cases, and design engineers tend to\nunderestimate what could go wrong in a space mission, especially as telemetry data are the\nonly means of diagnosing failure. Of course it is always possible to develop contingency\nprocedures during the mission execution, which is fine when there are no time pressures\nthat might put the spacecraft at risk.\n\nFlight procedures are delivered by the spacecraft manufacturer, together with the docu-\nmentation detailing the spacecraft design and operation (usually in the form of operations\nhandbooks). It is the task of the flight operations team to rework and customize these\nprocedures to make them relevant to the particular control centre, and to the MCS. This\ncustomization is especially required if the spacecraft manufacturer and operations team\nuse a different MCS! All flight operations procedures must then be validated to ensure\ntheir execution is feasible in a timely manner as well as being \u2018correct\u2019. This valida-\ntion is performed either against a software simulator or an engineering model, using the\ndelivered database. The software simulator is delivered by the spacecraft manufacturer\n\n\n\nTHE FLIGHT OPERATIONS SYSTEM 14.5 489\n\nand must be representative of the spacecraft in the way that telemetry values react to\ncommands. The environment simulation also needs to be realistic, although a complete\nsimulation of the thermal aspects is not usually required. Moreover it should offer teleme-\ntry and command interfaces to the MCS and the possibility to simulate failures. A software\nsimulator is clearly the most flexible solution as it allows the operations team to work\nin parallel with the Assembly, Integration and Verification (AIV) team. Otherwise, time\nwould need to be allocated for validation using the engineering model, thus blocking\nopportunities for ground testing or integration. The validation of flight procedures is an\niterative process involving not only the flight procedures themselves, but also the space-\ncraft documentation, the MCS database, the simulator and the display pages. All these\naspects are validated in the process. Finally an end-to-end System Validation Test (SVT)\ninvolving all the command and telemetry equipments that will be used for the mission,\nis performed to demonstrate the compatibility between the control centre and the space-\ncraft. The RF part of this is normally excluded from the SVT since it is included in the\nRF-compatibility tests.\n\nDuring the validation process, the definition of a common set of display pages is\nagreed between the flight operations team and the spacecraft manufacturer team, which\nis important for the mission execution. Since the spacecraft manufacturer is often asked\nto support the operations, it is important that experts from both teams can interact easily.\nThe validation status of the flight procedures is presented at the Operational Readiness\nReview (ORR).\n\n14.5.4 Mission planning\n\nThe Mission Planning System (MPS) builds the interface between the customer, the space\nsegment and the ground segment. It aims at using the space segment resources optimally\nto supply the customer with products (images, measurement data, bandwidth, and so on).\nSuch a system is minimally used during the LEOP and fully employed during routine\noperations, when the payload on-board the spacecraft is fully operational.\n\nMission planning is first considered when establishing a timeline for the LEOP. Later,\nduring the mission execution, mission planning also supports the spacecraft and ground\nresource management and as such contributes directly to operations.\n\nThe timeline produced for LEOP by the mission planning process is a detailed sequence\nof all the events foreseen during this early phase of the mission, timed accurately to the\nsecond. It is based on operational products delivered by flight dynamics, augmented by\nactivities from flight operations and ground data systems. The sequence of events is the\nguideline for all personnel involved in the mission, and consequently takes all aspects of\nthe mission into account, including:\n\n\u2022 orbital events as defined in the operational product delivered by flight dynamics;\n\u2022 ground station events as defined in the operational product delivered by flight\n\ndynamics\u2014examples of items included in the planning are ground station\nhandovers, stations used for uplink and downlink, backup stations during critical\nevents and ranging periods;\n\n\u2022 spacecraft and ground operations\u2014this is the planned sequence of flight and ground\nprocedures with their duration (these procedures are related to orbital events and the\nsequence shows what activities are planned, and at what time);\n\n\n\n490 GROUND SEGMENT\n\n\u2022 shift plan\u2014this schedules the presence of the various personnel required for the\nplanned activities.\n\nOf course, the establishment of a sequence of events is an iterative process and all\nthese activities are interconnected. For example, the execution of an orbit manoeuvre,\nas computed by the flight dynamics team during the mission analysis, implies starting\nthe operations in good time, so that the spacecraft is correctly oriented and configured at\nthe computed boost start time. However in the process of planning, it may turn out that the\nspecified flight procedures period is such that the required gyroscope calibration, based on\nSun and Earth sensors, would take place in a collinearity region, when the Sun vector and\nEarth vector seen from the spacecraft are almost parallel. This would imply poor accuracy\nin the attitude determination computed from these two pieces of information. Depending\non the other constraints, the flight operations team may have to start earlier, leaving a\npause between the calibration and the boost. This may in turn lead to the requirement for\nan extension of the ground support by a backup station. The other possibility is that the\nmanoeuvre may have to be postponed. The feasibility of any operational sequence needs\nto be demonstrated using the process of mission rehearsal.\n\nMission planning must be clearly supported by appropriate software to allow for rapid\nre-planning during mission execution. Re-planning is always necessary anyway to cope\nwith the continuous updates of operational products in nominal cases, but of course\nre-planning will be necessary in the event of anomalies, or simply late user requests.\nGraphical and textual outputs are required. Usually the mission planning sequence is\ntimed using UTC (since teams from all over the world may be involved in the mission),\nbut it is tabulated using Mission Elapsed Time (MET) which is the time since the launch.\nDoing so allows the planning process to be independent of potential launch delays.\n\nThe main aspect of mission planning is, however, related to resource management. For\ncomplex missions, this function can even be dedicated to a specific system, which takes\ncare of the entire process of planning, and the acquisition and dissemination of the data\nproduced by the spacecraft. Each mission is different, but an example will help to highlight\nthe key features of a mission planning system. Consider TerraSAR-X, a low-Earth orbiting\nsatellite carrying an X-band synthetic aperture radar, and supplying a large community\nof commercial and scientific users. These users specify their requests by specifying a\nregion of the Earth of which they require an image, and a time frame within which the\nimage is to be acquired. Short-term requests are often made by commercial users or in the\ncase of a disaster-monitoring situation. The construction of a feasible mission planning\nstrategy includes constraints imposed by the space segment (memory size, orbit position,\nand so on) and by the ground segment (ground contact opportunities). In the case of\nthe TerraSAR-X mission planning system, approximately one hundred constraints were\nmodelled in the process. User requests are accepted up to six hours before the next ground\ncontact (typically two per day) and planning is issued for the next three days. Depending\non the user, priority levels (from 0\u20139) are applied to these requests to resolve potential\nconflicts. In the last resort, such conflicts are resolved on a first-come-first-served basis.\nRequests with the highest priority are scheduled first and the resulting planning is then\nchecked against the constraints. If this planning is not feasible, the request is discarded.\nOtherwise it is accepted and the next request is processed until the process is complete.\nThe planning is then converted into command files and uploaded for the next 24 hour\nperiod, thus covering an interval with two possible ground contacts, which is robust with\nrespect to ground station failure. A command operator enters a feedback in the system\n\n\n\nTHE FLIGHT OPERATIONS SYSTEM 14.5 491\n\nabout which requests were actually up-linked, and the mission planning system records\nan overview of the requests already scheduled on-board. However since requests are\naccepted up to six hours before the next contact, the mission planning system must be\nable to re-plan (deletion or addition of requests) some late high-priority requests. Orbit\nmaintenance manoeuvres or contingency activities must also be taken into account in\nthe planning process as no images can be acquired in these cases. The mission planning\nsystem operates continuously, and provides the users with up-to-date information about\ntheir requests. It is fully automated and integrated with the MCS.\n\n14.5.5 Mission execution\n\nThe success and overall quality of the mission execution is dependent upon the thorough-\nness of activities undertaken in the preparatory phase\u2014for example, untested equipment\non the ground is likely to fail during critical support activities, or insufficiently trained\npeople are more likely to fail to detect an error on-board the spacecraft. As such, great\nefforts must be made to get all personnel involved in the mission execution to a level of\nproficiency where no question remains unanswered, and no uncertainty remains about the\nroles and tasks to be performed.\n\nThe role of each person involved in the mission execution must be defined clearly.\nAs well as the personnel of flight dynamics team, the ground data team and the flight\noperations team, the representatives of the customer are also involved and ultimately\ndecide what is to be done in the case of non-nominal operations. The customer usually\ninvolves personnel from the spacecraft manufacturer (forming the Satellite Support Team,\nSST, or Engineering Support Team, EST) to support the early orbit phase (from launcher\nseparation to final orbit) directly in the control room, as well as the commissioning phase\n(verification that all spacecraft systems survived the launch and are working nominally).\nAll these people form the combined flight operations team, which is led by a flight direc-\ntor. The flight director conducts the operations and coordinates the action of the combined\nflight operations team (see Figure 14.9). Within this team, individuals are usually respon-\nsible for a spacecraft subsystem (such as power, attitude determination and control, orbit\ncontrol, thermal control, data handling, and so on) either in a prime or a backup position.\nThese backup positions are important to ensure that expertise is available, even in the\ncase when the prime expert is missing due to illness or accident.\n\nThis organizational structure must be documented (in the mission operations plan),\nwhich is presented to the customer. Personnel are formally linked with the subsystems\nfor which they are responsible, and the related tasks they are to perform during the\nmission. Decision authorities are clearly identified, as well as the decision process to be\napplied in the case of an anomaly. The list of flight operations procedures (including their\nversion number and validation status), and the mission planning combine to complete\nthe flight operations plan. From this, a training and simulation plan is developed to give\nthe required proficiency to the combined team. All these documents must be reviewed\nthroughout the entire preparatory phase especially at the operational readiness review, the\ngoal of which is to state whether the ground segment is ready for the mission.\n\nThe training of personnel may begin with classroom sessions on spacecraft design.\nSuch sessions can be based on documentation (e.g. operations handbooks) delivered by\nthe spacecraft manufacturer. If possible, these sessions should be led by people from the\nspacecraft manufacturer to increase the quality of information (covering a broad range of\n\n\n\n492 GROUND SEGMENT\n\nMission Operations\nDirector\n\nSST Mission\nOperations Director\n\nSatellite Team\nLeader\n\nSatellite Support\nTeam (SST)\n\nFlight Director\n\nFlight Dynamics\nTeam\n\nNominal Operations\n\nAnomalies\n\nFlight Operations\nTeam\n\nGround Data\nSystems Team\n\nInformation: Directives & Information:\n\nFigure 14.9 A typical example of a ground operations team structure, illustrating the\ndecision flow (Credit: DLR)\n\ntopics) passed to operations personnel. If necessary, tools such as the software simulator\ncan be covered as well.\n\nAs the preparation continues, the flight operations team members will acquire special-\nized training related to one or more subsystems of the spacecraft, so that they acquire\nproficiency in the operation of these subsystems. Each such subsystem expert takes care\nof the flight procedures related to their subsystem, especially validation. This knowledge\nabout subsystem operations is then passed on to the other members of the team during\ndedicated training sessions. Tools specific to subsystems and developed for operations\n(off-line tools, derived parameters, and so on) are also covered.\n\nIn the meantime, simulations of different aspects of the mission are organized. They\nare performed with the satellite software simulator or the Electrical Ground Support\nEquipment (EGSE), using the validated flight procedures, the operational tools, the MCS\nand the delivered database. The sequence of events, defined by the mission planning\nprocess, is also used to verify that the activities are feasible as planned. Personnel from\nthe spacecraft manufacturer and the customer that are involved in the operations participate\nin the process to become accustomed to the operations environment.\n\nFinally one or two mission rehearsals are executed, covering the entire mission. These\nare performed in the flight environment (the final flight operations system with the MCS,\nthe database, procedures and the sequence of events) by the combined flight operations\nteam (which includes flight dynamics and the ground data systems, the spacecraft manu-\nfacturer, the customer and eventually the ground station team). The aim of these rehearsals\nis to demonstrate the proficiency of the combined flight operations team and the readi-\nness of the ground segment. This includes the correct loading of the last parameters from\nthe spacecraft parameter book, which is a document containing the numerical inputs for\noperations, such as sensor alignments or the final spacecraft mass. This is delivered in its\n\n\n\nREFERENCES 493\n\nfinal version shortly before launch. Contingency situations are also simulated to ensure\nthat the decision process is well understood and that personnel are also proficient with\nthese situations.\n\nThe mission execution itself is nominally only a repetition of the rehearsal. Once\nthe RF-contact with the spacecraft is established, a checkout of the bus and platform is\nperformed to ensure that no system has been damaged during the launch phase. Thereafter,\norbit manoeuvres are performed to bring the spacecraft to its final orbit. The verification of\ninstrument performance against design requirements follows, during the commissioning\nphase. After commissioning, the spacecraft is handed over to the customer for routine\noperations at the In-Orbit Acceptance Review (IOAR). On this occasion, all data (for\nexample\u2014orbital elements, next planned station keeping manoeuvre, loaded time-tagged\ncommands, current warnings and alarms, and so on) required for further operation of the\nspacecraft (as defined in the hand-over plan) is communicated to the customer.\n\nAfter hand-over, routine operations commence and the size of the all the teams (flight\ndynamics, ground data and flight operations) is usually reduced gradually. Some expert\npersonnel leave the project, to be replaced by others, illustrating the necessity of the\nmaintenance of up-to-date documentation and the provision of training sessions periodi-\ncally to maintain the team proficiency. Spacecraft performance is monitored through trend\nanalysis to detect the effect of aging or degradation. Periodic reviews are conducted with\nthe customer to assess the quality of the delivered service. The last critical events at\nthe end of the mission are passivation of the spacecraft and its de-orbiting. Last but not\nleast, lessons learned and experience gained on the mission is documented to improve\nfuture missions.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author wishes to thank his colleagues from the German Space Operations Centre\n(GSOC) for their review and comments: R.

Aglietti\n\nAeronautics & Astronautics, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment,\nUniversity of Southampton\n\n15.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nSpacecraft usually contain mechanisms, the functions of which are indispensable to the\ncraft\u2019s mission. Often, mechanisms will be part of one of the major subsystems, such as\nthe attitude and orbit control system (AOCS) or the power supply system, where they\nperform essential tasks supporting the subsystem\u2019s operation. It follows that great care\nhas to be taken to ensure their reliability as the effect of a mechanism\u2019s failure upon the\nmission is never less than serious\u2014and is frequently catastrophic\u2014if it occurs. In this\nsense, mechanisms are critical. This at once makes reliability a fundamental requirement\nfor every mechanism design.\n\nAs is the case for other subsystems, the development of spacecraft mechanisms evolves\nfrom system requirements and specifications that cascade down from the system to\nsubsystem-level. Hence the requirements applicable to spacecraft mechanisms cover var-\nious areas, ranging from the definition of the functions of the specific mechanism and\nits interfaces (physical envelope, mass, electrical interfaces, and so on) to more general\nrequirements [1, 2], determined by the launch and space environments, which have been\ndescribed in Chapters 2, 7, 8 and 11.\n\nBased on these initial requirements, some concept designs are defined, which will\nprovide further information to define more detailed requirements. Depending on the nature\nand heritage of the type of mechanism, various concepts may be developed in parallel,\nuntil a design is selected as the baseline for the hardware development (with possible\nback-up options) and the requirements are transformed into the mechanism specifications.\n\nIn this chapter, typical space mechanisms requirements will be briefly discussed, fol-\nlowed by the description of design applications divided into two broad categories:\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W. Stark.\n\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n496 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\n\u2022 One-shot devices , which, as the name suggests, are mechanisms required to function\nonly once during the spacecraft mission (e.g. satellite release mechanisms, deploy-\nment mechanisms for whip antennas, most of the deployment mechanisms for solar\narrays, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Continuously (or intermittently) operating devices , which include all those mecha-\nnisms that are required to run continuously (e.g. momentum and reaction wheels) or\nintermittently (e.g. antenna pointing mechanisms, solar array drives, etc.) throughout\nthe life of the spacecraft.\n\nThe typical mechanism\u2019s components are then described, and the chapter is concluded by\nthree sections about materials, tribology and testing.\n\n15.1.1 Requirements for space mechanisms\n\nMechanisms have to be designed ensuring that their function(s) achieve performances that\nmeet the system level requirements and specifications. This means that the parameters\ncharacteristic of the type of mechanism, e.g. the accuracy of a pointing mechanism,\nthe angular momentum of a momentum wheel or the torque of a reaction wheel, have\nto be specified (with their tolerances) and verified to meet the system specifications.\nAlso, electrical parameters such as power consumption (and its transients) must be within\nspecified limits.\n\nThe physical and electrical interfaces of the mechanism are required to match those\nof the subsystems that interface with the mechanism. This will affect the specifications\nof mechanical mountings, total mass (and moments of inertia), position of the centre of\nmass and the variation of these parameters while the mechanism functions. Similarly, all\nthe electrical connections will need to be specified.\n\nDuring the functioning of the mechanism, it is very likely that the moving parts (due\nto their inertia and accelerations) will produce some mechanical reactions (forces and\nmoments) at their supports. In some cases, these interface loads are generated intentionally\nto fulfil the mechanism\u2019s functions (e.g. reaction wheels). However, moving parts (e.g.\na piston of a pump for a cooler, or a rotor that, due to manufacturing tolerances, is\nslightly unbalanced, or ball bearings that are not perfectly spherical and roll on a surface\nwhich is not perfectly flat., etc.) can also produce very low level mechanical disturbances\n(microvibrations) that are transmitted through the mechanism interface and propagate\nthroughout the spacecraft structure. Certain types of space instruments or payloads (e.g.\nhigh resolution cameras and telescopes and interferometers) have very stringent stability\nrequirements, and therefore the microvibrations produced by other on-board equipment\n(typically mechanisms) have to be controlled and minimized whenever possible. As a\nconsequence, for some types of missions there will be a limit on the maximum level of\nmicrovibrations that can be emitted by the mechanisms on board.\n\nAs some mechanisms have a relatively large mounting interface (or multiple\ninterfaces\u2014such as an antenna pointing mechanism (APM) that interfaces on one side\nwith the satellite structure and on the other, with an antenna dish supporting frame) the\nmechanism itself, in its stowed configuration, can act as a (secondary) load path. Hence,\nthe stiffness of the mechanism (or its interfaces) may need to be maintained below a\ncertain threshold to control the loads through the mechanism. On the other hand, when\nthe mechanism is \u2018deployed\u2019, there will be requirements on the minimum stiffness to\n\n\n\nONE-SHOT DEVICES 15.2 497\n\nguarantee that the deployed appendage has a resonance above a specified limit, to avoid\ndynamic coupling with the satellite AOCS.\n\nThe design of mechanisms, including material selection, structural dimensions and siz-\ning of mechanical and electrical components, should follow good design practice and\nmeet sets of standards or requirements agreed between the organization carrying out the\nmechanism development and the final customer of the mechanism. For example, the Stan-\ndard ECSS-E-ST-33-01C (issued by the European Space Agency) contains requirements,\nincluding design rules with specific values for applicable design margins, based on years\nof experience in space mechanisms development.\n\nClearly, the mechanisms have to be able to withstand the various environments that they\nwill encounter during their life, and overall it should be demonstrated that the mechanism\nwill be able to operate, meeting the specified performance, until its designated end of life.\nFor mission critical mechanisms, conformance to the specified reliability figure should be\nrigorously demonstrated, whereas, for non-mission critical mechanisms, some simplified\nmethods of reliability analysis can be applied. A Failure Mode Effects and Criticality\nAnalysis (FMECA) (see for example ECSS-Q-ST-30-02) should always be carried out.\nAll single point failure modes should be eliminated (e.g. using redundancy) and, if that is\nnot viable, an appropriate justification should be provided (and accepted by the customer).\n\nAll the requirements applied to spacecraft structures are usually applicable to the mech-\nanism structure, and here the launch conditions often provide the worst (i.e. the most\ndemanding) mechanical environment.\n\nThe space environment is generally not very hostile to mechanisms, with the two\nimportant exceptions of tribology and temperature (especially thermal gradients). Nearly\nevery mechanism failure in space is due to either poor choice of materials, an inadequate\nunderstanding of space tribology or poor estimation of thermal gradients, which can lead\nto high loads and high torques. The requirement for very long life in rotating machinery\nputs an even stronger emphasis on these three areas. Many failures of space mechanisms\nare due to poor engineering practice and an inability to assess risk. Every decision taken\nby the designer clearly involves an element of risk, and an ability to appreciate and assess\nthat risk is, in the author\u2019s opinion, condicio sine qua non for success.\n\n15.2 ONE-SHOT DEVICES\n\nTypically, the function of one-shot devices is to change the structural configuration of the\nspacecraft. These changes can be dramatic events, such as stage separations of a launch\nvehicle, major changes in a satellite configuration, such as deployment of large solar\narrays, or they may be relatively minor events such as the deployment of a small whip\nantenna. In all cases, the change in configuration is produced by allowing and then forcing\nthe relative motion of some of the parts of the mechanism that were previously constrained\nby a hold-down device. Consequently, in most systems, it is possible to distinguish at\nleast two separate functions carried out by two (or more) different type of devices.\n\nThe first function is to restrain firmly (hold-down) one or more parts of the mechanism\nfor all the time up to the moment when the system is finally \u2018fired\u2019. The actuation is\ngenerally carried out by pyrotechnic devices (e.g. explosive bolts or pyrocutters). However\nlower shock devices (e.g. non-explosive devices based on memory shape alloys) are also\navailable. When fired, the moving part of the mechanism is released, directly or by\nactivating/opening a more complex latching mechanism.\n\n\n\n498 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nThe second function is to enforce a predetermined movement (e.g. deployment) of\nparticular parts of the mechanism. In order to perform this function, most mechanisms\nstore some form of potential energy which, during the release/deployment, powers the\nmovement. Since these devices are designed to work only once, one of the most commonly\nused methods is to store the potential energy in springs. The springs are loaded when the\nmechanism is \u2018charged\u2019, and they store the energy until the moment when mechanism is\nactivated, which can be months or years later (as in the case of the release mechanisms\nfor the Rosetta lander or for planetary probes such as Huygens). The release of the\nelastic energy stored in the spring is a relatively sudden phenomenon and the moving\npart(s) might acquire a relatively large amount of kinetic energy. Consequently, damping\ndevices are often included, in particular to control the arrest of the mechanism when fully\ndeployed. Devices for separation, for example launch vehicle stage separation or satellite\nrelease mechanisms, do not generally require the addition of dampers, since the kinetic\nenergy stays with the parts that separate, causing them to drift apart. Other mechanisms\nare powered by the expansion of gas (e.g. nitrogen) previously compressed and stored in\ncylinders. In this case the release of the gas is controlled by valves and the expanding\ngas can be used to move linear piston-like devices, or to deploy inflatable structures. For\nspinning spacecraft, the deployment of radial appendages can by driven by \u2018centrifugal\u2019\nforce (e.g. Geos), but this is the exception rather than the rule. Some mechanisms, for\nexample those to deploy booms, are sometimes required to be retractable, and in this\ncase they are generally actuated by electric motors. However these mechanisms cannot\nbe classified as truly one-shot devices.\n\n15.2.1 Separation systems\n\nIn every mission, various separation systems are used, and classic examples are the mech-\nanisms used to release satellites from the launch vehicle. Most of these mechanisms are\nbased on the use of a Marmon clampband , which has been in use since the early days of\nspace exploration. It remains one of the most reliable and commonly-used mechanism [3].\n\nThe basic version of this device, whose cross-section is shown in Figure 15.1, is a\ncircular belt with shoes having a V-shape horizontal grove, secured to its internal surface\n(see also Figure 8.4). When the clampband is taut, the V-grove on the shoes engages\ntwo circular mating flanges (one flange is part of the launch vehicle structure and the\nother one is part of the satellite structure) holding them together. The mechanism is\nactivated by a pyrocutter or similar device that cuts a retaining bolt. Once this bolt is cut,\nthe belt opens up (usually helped by torsional springs) pulling out the shoes, and thus\nfreeing the flanges. At this moment the satellite is pushed away by separation springs\nsecured to the structure on the launch vehicle side. For flanges with a diameter larger\nthan around 1 m, the clampband is usually divided into two or more segments of equal\nlength, joined by the pyrotechnically-actuated bolts. Figure 15.2 shows a view of all the\nmechanical components of a large separation mechanism. In this case, these devices have\nto be perfectly synchronized to make sure that the belt opens up at all the junctions\nsimultaneously. The main advantage of this type of mechanism, apart from its simplicity,\nis that the two flanges are held together along the whole perimeter, thus transferring the\nloads in a relatively uniform manner. This is particularly advantageous when the two\nstructures to be constrained are cylindrical, which for launch vehicles is always the case.\n\n\n\nONE-SHOT DEVICES 15.2 499\n\n(b) Mechanism opened\n\n(a) Mechanism closed\n\nShoes Mating flanges\n\nSatellite side\n\nLaunch vehicle side \n\nBelt\n\nSeparation springs\n\nFigure 15.1 Cross section of Marmon clampband-type release mechanism\n\nFigure 15.2 Components of the Saab Ericsson Space separation mechanism.\n(Reproduced by permission of Saab Ericsson Space)\n\n\n\n500 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nOther types of release mechanisms for spacecraft have been designed, tested and\nused successfully, but the marmon clamp band, in its various versions, is still the most\nwidely used.\n\n15.2.2 Mechanisms for deployable structures\n\nVarious types of mechanisms can be used in order to deploy elements of the spacecraft\nwhich are generally referred to as appendages .\n\nThe simplest method to deploy an appendage is to use a knuckle joint located at the\nroot of the appendage. This joint can be a simple hinge coupled with a torsional spring.\nAn example of this is shown in Figure 15.3, which is used to deploy a whip antenna. The\ntorsional spring forces the rotation of the hinge, driving the deployment of the antenna\nand keeping the structure fully deployed once the hinge reaches its end-stop.\n\nFigure 15.3 Hinge of whip antenna. (Reproduced by permission of AEC- ABLE\nEngineering Inc)\n\n\n\nONE-SHOT DEVICES 15.2 501\n\nOpen Closed \n\nFigure 15.4 Rosetta lander landing gear. (Reproduced by permission of\nDr H. Rosenbauer)\n\nIn some cases, deployment mechanisms are required to be self-locking, in order to\nguarantee that the deployed part of the structure does not fold back when loaded. For\nexample, this is the case for the joints used to deploy the legs of the Rosetta lander\u2019s\nlanding gear (Figure 15.4). Here it is crucial that the legs, once deployed are kept in\nposition, and therefore a device called a mechanical diode is used to guarantee that\nthe deployment movement of the legs cannot be reversed by the forces applied during\ntouch down. The hinges used for the deployable solar arrays on the satellite CFESat (see\nFigure 15.5) used a similar concept. At the end of the rotation, driven by the clock spring\nvisible in Figure, when the dowel hits the hard stop a latching lever (pushed by a secondary\ntorsion spring not visible in Figure) prevents the hinge from possible rotation backwards.\n\nA very simple type of self-locking joint is the tape spring hinge. This flexible linkage\nis made by two tape springs parallel to each other, which connect two structural segments\nas is shown in Figure 15.6. The joint is folded by allowing the tape spring internal to the\nhinge to buckle and then bending the deployable part of the mechanism. Once folded,\n\nFigure 15.5 Hinge for solar array used on CFESat.

(b) Side view of\nthe joint (folded). (c) Side view of the joint (deployed)\n\nstrain energy is stored in the tape springs and, as soon as the constraint to the deployable\npart of the mechanism is removed, the tapes spring straight thus opening the joint. Once\nstraight this joint has a high rotational/bending stiffness (produced by the high buckling\nload of the tape springs) but relatively low shear stiffness. This mechanism does not\ncontrol and restrain the parts as precisely as a hinge, but it is much simpler and cheaper.\nAlso, this mechanism can be exploited to deploy relatively long booms made up of shorter\nsegments connected by tape spring hinges. This approach has been used for the design\nof a 2.5 m long boom on the micro-satellite FedSat . The boom, made of six rigid tubular\nsegments connected by tape spring hinges, carries a magnetometer on its tip, and is used\nto stabilize the satellite, exploiting the gravity gradient torque.\n\nA common problem in the design of these types of mechanisms is that the structure\nto be deployed is made up of one or more relatively long structural members, which\nhave to be constrained against the external surface of the spacecraft prior to deployment.\nThis problem can be overcome using telescopic booms, and in fact these mechanisms\nhave been commonly employed on spacecraft. Various methods have been used to deploy\ntelescopic booms. For example, a looped tape, held taut between pulleys and supported\n\nENDLESS METAL TAPE TAPE\nDRIVE PLATE\n\nPOSITIVE\nTRACKING\nFEATURES\n\nDRIVE PULLEY\n\nTAPE\nTENSIONING\n\nDEVICE\nDIVERTOR\n\nPULLEY\n\nTUBE\nDRIVE LUGS\n\nDRIVE PULLEY\nTENSIONER\n\nPULLEYDIVERTER\n\nTOWER LAUNCH\nSUPPORT\n\nDRIVE\nBELT/TAPETUBE\n\nELEMENTS\n\nDRIVE\nMOUNTED EXTERAL\nTO OUTER ELEMENT\n\nOF TUBE STACK\n\nTUBE\nDRIVE LUGSSUPPORT\n\nTOWER\n\nOUTBOARD\nIDLER\n\nFigure 15.7 Telescopic boom (a) mechanism concept (b) detail of the tape drive\nassembly.

However, telescopic booms still require a relatively large stowage volume,\nhaving its longest dimension in the direction of the boom.\n\nA solution to this problem is to use devices similar to a carpenter\u2019s measuring tape,\nwhich is stowed rolled on a reel, and deployed by unrolling the reel. The concept is\nillustrated in Figure 15.8. The boom is elastically flattened into a strip (tape) and stowed\nrolled-up onto a drum. When the tape is unrolled, to extend the boom, it reacquires its\noriginal shape, thus gaining the bending stiffness necessary to keep the boom straight.\nThis type of boom has good structural properties when extended. However, high shear\n\nTubular boom\n\nDeployment\nmechanism\n\nTypical cross sections for\ndeployable tubular booms:\n\n(a) Lenticular welded double element\n\n(b) Overlapping single element\n\n(c) Overlapping double element\n\n(d) Interlocking double element\n\nFigure 15.8 Collapsible Tube Mast Deployment mechanism.

(Reproduced by permission of AEC-\nABLE Engineering Inc)\n\nstresses arise in the welding between the two halves when the boom is rolled onto a\nsmall reel. Simpler devices can be built using just one element (Figure 15.8b). However\nthis type of boom has inferior structural properties, and in particular it has a very low\ntorsional stiffness. To improve the structural properties of the deployed booms there are\nseveral possibilities, as shown in Figure 15.8 (c) and (d). However these types of devices\nrequire two reels, and therefore add complexity to the mechanism.\n\nAnother class of deployment mechanism is the deployable lattice mast. A particularly\nsuccessful example of this is the AEC- ABLE CoilABLE mast, shown in Figure 15.9.\nThis mast is an integral part of the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) system, holding\naloft a stereoscopic camera which provided panoramic views of the Red Planet. When\nfully deployed, the open lattice mast is about 0.7 m long. However, when stowed, it\nretracts to 10% of its extended length, coiling up inside a 76 mm long canister. The\nstored strain energy in the structure allows the CoilABLE mast to self-deploy without\nexpensive motors that add weight and complexity. The lightweight steel and fibreglass\nconstruction provides a steady, rigid base for the IMP camera, with a mass of less than\n0.7 kg. Alternatively lattice masts can be in the form of articulated trusses composed by\nrigid segments hinged together.\n\n\n\nONE-SHOT DEVICES 15.2 505\n\n15.2.3 Surface deployment devices\n\nSolar arrays\n\nTypically, solar arrays can be assemblies composed of rigid panels, flexible surfaces\nin the form of a blanket rolled up on a drum or a semi-rigid surface folded like a\nconcertina. Rigid arrays are composed of a number of panels, usually sandwich structures\nwith an aluminium honeycomb core and CFRP skins, hinged together. The assembly is\nfolded, and the resulting stack of panels is secured against the side of the satellite during\nlaunch, and then unfolded in space. Most often, the panels are also connected together and\nwith the yoke (that connects the deployed array with the satellite) by a synchronization\nmechanism, generally composed of cables tensioned by springs and pulleys. The purpose\nof this mechanism is to control the deployment sequence, to avoid interference with other\nparts of the satellite. Sun pointing of the deployed array is then maintained with a solar\narray drive mechanism (SADM) that rotates the yoke with respect to the satellite. The\nhold-down and release mechanism must be stiff enough to prevent movement during\nlaunch. The possibility of friction welding at the load points is very real.\n\nA typical solar array, held in the stowed position by a stack of cup-and-cone devices,\nis shown in Figure 15.10, and one of the main concerns in the design is to ensure\nappropriate preload to prevent gapping during the launch loads. The hinge system must\naccommodate out-of-plane movement, so spherical-bearings are commonly used. There\nhave been cases of distortion due to thermal gradients producing torques high enough to\nstop deployment. The latch-up mechanism must stiffen the array and eliminate backlash. In\n\nFigure 15.10 Stowed rigid solar array, showing detail of the cup-and-cone stack.\n(Reproduced by permission of Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd)\n\n\n\n506 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nall spring-driven deployment systems, a problem needing careful resolution is the control\nof the stored energy. The torque to be provided should never be less than four times the\nestimated resisting torque, and must ensure final latch-up. To absorb the surplus energy,\na wide variety of devices have been used, including clutter mechanisms, friction brakes,\ncrushable honeycomb plugs, eddy current and fluid dampers. The balance between stored\nand absorbed energy is always one that requires very careful judgment.\n\nFlexible arrays require a tensioning system, which can be an articulated mast or other\ntype of deployable boom system. In either cases, this provides a framework to unroll or\nunfold the array and maintain it flat like a membrane supporting (tensioning) its edges.\n\nOverall, even the simplest concepts can be full of hidden failure mechanisms, and\nthere are too many cases of failures during deployment of solar arrays to encourage\ncomplacency.\n\nAntennas\n\nAntennas (see Section 12.3.3) vary from the elementary single rod whip antenna to the\ncomplexity of the TDRSS and Galileo unfolding umbrellas (Figure 15.11). In the latter\ndesign, the antenna surface is a wire mesh in which the tension of every wire is predeter-\nmined and set. The antenna is then folded as an umbrella and, when unfolded in space,\nthe surface shape must be precisely recovered. Since the diameter of such an antenna is\nabout 4 m the mechanical problems are formidable. The design, manufacture and assembly\n\nFigure 15.11 An Umbrella-type antenna. The figure shows the Galileo 4.8 m diameter,\n18-rib wire mesh high gain antenna in its deployed state. (Reproduced by permission of\nNASA/JPL - Caltech)\n\n\n\nCONTINUOUSLY AND INTERMITTENTLY OPERATING DEVICES 15.3 507\n\nare driven by the need for extreme precision in the final shape of the antenna which in\nturn impacts on every mechanical item in the system. Once in Jovian orbit, unfortunately\nthe Galileo antenna did not deploy completely, to the disappointment of scientists and\nengineers. The reason for this malfunction was most likely excessive vibration experi-\nenced by the mechanism during terrestrial transportation. In fact, the launch of the Galileo\nspacecraft was delayed a few years, during which it was transported back to JPL and then\nagain to its launch site. This episode emphasizes how the life of a mechanism has to be\nfollowed by its designers, and how the impact of changes in the mission planning has\nto be assessed in order to avoid undesirable results. With the benefit of hindsight, the\nGalileo mission to Jupiter will be seen as one of the major achievements in the history\nof astronautics, despite this significant mechanism failure.\n\nInflatable structures\n\nInflatable technology has been used in aerospace applications over many decades, as the\nability to deploy large structures with a low mass and very high packing efficiency has\nalways been a requirement in the space industry. Flight heritage began in the 1950s with\nthe Echo Balloon series, which were designed as passive space-based communications\nreflectors. Echo Balloon 1 was approximately 33 m in diameter, weighed 61 kg and was\nconstructed from 12 micron-thick Mylar [5]. Other flight demonstrations followed such as\nthe Goodyear antennas in the 1960s, and the Contraves antennas and sunshades in the late\n1970s to the mid 1980s. One of the most notable flight experiments to have occurred in\nrecent decades was performed on the NASA shuttle mission STS-77 in 1996. This resulted\nin the successful deployment and test of the Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE), which\ndemonstrated significant advances in inflatable technology with low construction costs.\nInflatable antennas supported by telescopic booms (SULA BOOM) were also used on the\nsatellite CFESat .\n\nApplications of space inflatable structures are widespread, and include: solar arrays,\ncommunication systems, radar and reflector arrays, solar concentrators, solar shades, solar\nsails, planetary surface exploration infrastructure and impact protection, and human habi-\ntats. An inflatable module was proposed for the International Space Station (ISS), which\nwas subsequently designed and developed by the NASA Johnson Spaceflight Centre. This\nconcept of an inflatable transit habitat became known as \u2018Transhab\u2019. Although cutbacks\nto the ISS program prevented the construction and flight test of the Transhab module, the\nconcept was taken up by private companies and led to the flight test of Genesis I and II\nin 2006 and 2007 respectively, designed by Bigelow Aerospace. For further information\nconcerning inflatable structures for space applications the reader is referred to References\n[6, 7 and 8].\n\n15.3 CONTINUOUSLY AND INTERMITTENTLY\n\nOPERATING DEVICES\n\nIn general this covers a large variety of devices, but in limiting ourselves to spacecraft\nmechanisms it is useful to divide the category into:\n\n\u2022 mechanisms that operate throughout the life of the satellite such as momentum\nwheels, solar array drives, de-spin mechanisms and horizon scanners;\n\n\n\n508 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\n\u2022 mechanisms that operate intermittently or on demand, such as antenna-pointing\nmechanisms and retractable appendages.\n\n15.3.1 Continuously rotating mechanisms\n\nSolar array drive (SAD)\n\nThese are needed to decouple the motion of the solar array from that of the satellite to\nmaintain a Sun-pointing direction. The speed for a geostationary orbit will clearly be one\nrevolution per day whilst in LEO it may be about 15 revolutions per day.\n\nFigure 15.12 reveals the construction of a typical SAD mechanism. The shaft is mounted\non two angular contact bearings lubricated by a film of lead and preloaded by a titanium\ndiaphragm, which also accommodates thermal expansion and the movement required to\noff-load the bearings for launch. Allowing the bearing to slide on the shaft is discouraged\nin all spacecraft systems due to the risk of seizure. Both the shaft and the housing are\nmade from beryllium, to take advantage of its high stiffness, good thermal conductivity\nand a coefficient of expansion matching that of steel. For off-loading, the bearings are\ndisplaced by a lever system onto a conical seating. Figure 15.12 shows the system in this\nstate. The lever is retained by a pyrotechnically operated pin-puller. Two brushed DC\nmotors are provided for redundancy, and are acceptable because the number of rotations\nrequired for a seven year life is under 5000. The slip-ring system is conventional with two\ndry lubricated brushes running on each ring.

Although an\nold design it has a very good operational history and shows the main features of a SAD.\n\nGiotto de-spin mechanism\n\nWith the Intelsat series of dual spinners there is significant experience of the design and\noperation of de-spin mechanisms in the USA. However, in Europe such experience is\nrelatively limited\u2014a good example of a European design is the Giotto de-spin mech-\nanism. As a spin-stabilized spacecraft Giotto needed such a mechanism to de-spin the\nhigh gain antenna from 14 rpm, with a further requirement to nullify the speed with no\njitter. A cross-section of the mechanism is shown in Figure 15.13. Normally, a very\nstiff servo loop needing some 180 updates per revolution would be needed. However,\nto simplify the system, the designer decided on one update per revolution, thus throw-\ning the problem back to the bearing designer to achieve a low and consistent torque\nthroughout the life of Giotto. Tests at the European Space Tribology Laboratory (ESTL)\ndemonstrated that lead-lubricated bearings could achieve the desired performance and\nthey were adopted. The off-load mechanism, released by a pyrotechnic, can be seen\ntogether with the two drive motors. These were the same 1200 steps-per-revolution motors\nas used in the Hubble primary deployment system, but here they run as synchronous\nmotors to achieve absolute speed control. The success of the Giotto mission is now\nspace history.\n\nMomentum and reaction wheels\n\nThe different roles for these two types of wheel in the AOCS are made clear in Section\n9.4.7 of Chapter 9. Momentum wheels have large momentum (around 50\u2013200 Nm s)\nand a maximum speed of up to 10 000 rpm. Reaction wheels, meanwhile, have a\n\nTitanium\nflange\n\nFlexible\ndiaphragm\n\nFigure 15.13 Giotto de-spin mechanism. (Reproduced by permission of EADS Astrium\nLtd.)\n\n\n\n510 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nsmaller capacity (about 2 Nm s) and a speed up to 4000 rpm in both directions. Electro-\nmechanically, however, they are similar devices and use the same technology. The speeds\nof both types of wheel are limited by the bearing system and by power consumption, and\nalthough, from a mass point of view, a very small wheel rotating very fast would appear\nattractive, the power needed to produce the same torque from it would be very large since\nthe energy in the wheel is a function of the speed squared. The bearing system is critical\nto success and almost all ball-bearing mounted wheels follow a similar approach. The\nangular contact bearings are preloaded by carefully designed springs to avoid variation\nof torque with temperature. Ball bearing lubrication remains the principal life-limiting\nfactor for momentum and reaction wheels, as it is necessary to maintain a small and\nconstant (to avoid torque variation) quantity of oil lubrication. To prevent loss of oil\nand to maintain extreme cleanliness, the wheels can be encased in a hermetic canisters\nfilled with an appropriate gas, e.g. helium. Figure 15.14 shows an example of reaction\nwheel assembly.\n\nTo avoid some of these problems wheels supported by magnetic bearings have been\nthe subject of intense development for more than 40 years in France, Germany and the\nUSA. To support a wheel magnetically in five degrees of freedom (DOF) a choice must\nbe made between a passive permanent magnet and an actively controlled electro-magnet.\nIn the nineteenth century it was shown to be impossible to support all five degrees of\nfreedom with permanent magnets alone; the system is fundamentally unstable and one\ndegree at least must be actively controlled. Permanent magnets are attractive in their\nsimplicity and almost-zero power consumption - they do in fact have a very small drag,\nbut low stiffness [9].\n\nIt has become common practice to identify space wheels by the number of actively-\ncontrolled DOF. The first magnetic-bearing wheel to fly in Space was a French 1 DOF\nwheel, in SPOT 1 (three wheels) in 1986. In this type of wheel the actively controlled DOF\n\nFigure 15.14 SSTL 200SP Reaction wheel assembly.

This design results in a flatter geometry\nand higher momentum-to-mass ratios. 2 DOF wheels have flown successfully on SPOT 4,\nSPOT 5, HELIOS, ENVISAT and METOP . These types of reaction wheels, developed by\nAerospatiale, have a maximum angular speed of 2500 rpm. However, the new generations\nof 2 DOF wheels can reach up to 10 000 rpm [10].\n\nThe 5 DOF wheel, for example, the MWI series wheels developed by Rockwell Collins,\nInc. in Germany, can be regarded as the most advanced on the market and embodies all\nthe capabilities of magnetic suspension. All magnetic bearing wheels include ball-bearings\nas safety touch-down elements in case of failure.\n\nEach type of wheel has advantages and drawbacks. The ball-bearing wheels are rel-\natively simple and therefore cheap, and give reliable lives up to 10 years or more.\nThey are, however, mechanically noisy due to the bearings; furthermore, there is dif-\nficulty in achieving perfect balance, and they cannot act effectively as nutation dampers.\nMagnetically-suspended wheels eliminate some of these problems. By removing bearing\nwear, the speed limitation is now governed by power consumption and the root stress in\nthe wheel. The need for a hermetically sealed case disappears [11].\n\nThe 5 DOF wheel adds further sophistication [12]. With the availability of full control\nof each DOF the wheel can be fully balanced, and the damping capability in each loop can\nbe used to control nutation of the spacecraft. Yet more significant is the ability to tilt the\nwheel axis through a small angle, currently \u00b11.7? (MWI series), allowing either three-axis\ncontrol or cross-momentum storage with only one wheel. Further extension of the system,\nby adding mechanical gimbals for a larger angle of tilt, is feasible or, alternatively, two\nskewed contra-rotating wheels could be used to achieve full attitude control.\n\n\n\n512 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\n15.3.2 Intermittently operated mechanisms\n\nAs examples of this type of mechanism, we look at antenna pointing mechanisms (APMs),\nalthough in some modes of operation the APM may be continuously trimming the\nantenna direction.\n\nAll APMs will be designed to operate in one or more of three modes as follows:\n\n\u2022 steady-state pointing , maintaining alignment with any predefined angle on both axes\nto an accuracy of \u00b10.01?;\n\n\u2022 re-pointing , when it shall be capable of re-pointing the antenna through any required\nangle to an accuracy of \u00b10.01?;\n\n\u2022 tracking , when it shall be capable of maintaining the antenna on a station, following\na ground-based RF beam in closed loop mode to \u00b10.015?.\n\nIn addition, in the event of complete failure of a drive it must be possible to return the\nantenna to a nominal zero position and lock it.\n\nAPMs are required to rotate the antenna in the direction of a specific \u2018target\u2019. In general,\nto perform this function, it is necessary to control independently two rotational degrees of\nfreedom. These are controlled by gimbal-drives and, at least in theory, the axes of these\ndrives could have any orientation. In practice it is desirable for the gimbals to have axes\nalong mutually orthogonal directions, one of which is either \u2018horizontal\u2019 or \u2018vertical\u2019.\nThis leads to two possible configurations [13].\n\nIn the first configuration, called az-el , the elevation of the antenna is controlled by a\nhorizontal-axis gimbal-drive, which in turn is supported by a vertical-axis gimbal-drive.\nThis configuration is very common in the driving mechanisms for ground station antennas,\nbut is also used for APM on board satellites, see Figure 15.16.\n\nThe second type of configuration, called x ? y , is shown in Figure 15.17 This mech-\nanism allows the deployment of large antennas situated on the side of the body of the\nspacecraft and closed in a clam-shell fashion for launch.

(Reproduced by permission of EADS Astrium Ltd)\n\nAPM, as shown in Figure 15.17, the outer becomes also the deployment axis whilst the\ninner remains a pointing axis of limited amplitude. This development required enlarge-\nment of the outer axis bearings, a reconsideration of the lubrication system and stiffening\nof the bearing mountings, none of which changed the fundamental features of the concept.\n\nAn example of an alternative design is the Olympus APM. This mechanism utilizes the\nswash-plate or rotating-wedge principle. The structure, shown in Figure 15.18, consists\nof four cylindrical and co-axial elements. The two end sections act as the spacecraft and\npayload interfaces and are prevented from mutual rotation by a bellows. The two centre\nsections are wedge-shaped and are able to rotate independently about the common axis\nby means of a bearing system. The two swash-plates may therefore be considered to have\npointing vectors, equal to their wedge angles, which may be rotated independently. Their\nvector sum is the resultant pointing angle of the mechanism. By driving these wedges,\nany pointing angle may be achieved within a conical pointing range with a semi-cone\nangle equal to twice the swash angle; for Olympus the range is 8.6?.\n\nThe excellent mechanical strength and stiffness of the mechanism removes all need for\nan off-load device during launch. Its relatively small size, its substantial load capacity\nof 50 kg, and its advantage of being a closed and self-contained unit makes for easy\nintegration in the spacecraft and flexibility of use for other pointing applications [14].\n\n15.4 COMPONENTS\n\n15.4.1 Electric motors\n\nSince these are the only source of continuous mechanical power on spacecraft they are\nperhaps the most important mechanism component. Reliability is paramount and in critical\nsystems they will be either double-wound or fully duplicated. In space applications, the\n\n\n\n514 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nAntenna\ninterface\n\nSatellite\ninterface\n\nSwash plate 1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nSwash plate 2\n\nFigure 15.18 Olympus Antenna Pointing Mechanism (a) principle of operation and\n(b) the mechanical arrangement. (Reproduced by permission of EADS Astrium Ltd)\n\nmost commonly used electric motors are DC Motors (brushed or brushless), or Stepper\nMotors [15].\n\nDC motors used in space are usually permanent magnet machines but may be either\nbrushed or brushless. As they give maximum torque at zero speed and, in the brushed\nconfiguration, can be used with minimum electronics, making them attractive for many\nspace applications. Dissipation of heat is a major problem and space motors may have to\nbe de-rated by as much as 70%. There are cases where the motor is actually housed in a\nsealed compartment (e.g. reaction and momentum wheels produced by Satellite Services\nLtd, UK) containing gas at 1 atm pressure, and in this case the full power potential of\nthe motor can be exploited. Brush wear is of course the life-limiting parameter (see\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS 15.4 515\n\nSection 15.4.2). Brushless motors have the advantage of being very controllable at the\nexpense of considerable electronic complexity. They are now widely used both in space\nand on the ground to take full advantage of the DC motor\u2019s performance linked to\nexcellent controllability.\n\nIn general the design of brushless DC motors tends to achieve a particular type of\nperformance profile. Where high torque is required (up and beyond 1000 Nm), the motor\ntends to have a relatively large diameter and short axial length. If higher speeds are\nrequired, the ratio between axial length and diameter of the motor will be higher. Also, if\nspecifically smooth speed/torque characteristics are required, so-called \u2018toothless\u2019 brush-\nless DC motors are employed. However, it should be remembered that mass, size and\npower consumption for the electronics necessary in a brushless motor are larger than that\nof a brush assembly. The use of brushes in some applications in space may also have unac-\nceptable drawbacks in terms of the brush\u2019s behaviour in vacuum (wear, maintainability\netc.) therefore making a brushless motor more attractive.\n\nIn the solar array drive (Figure 15.12), the motors are brushed only because at one\nrevolution per day the lifetime total will not exceed about 5000 revolutions.\n\nStepper motors have simple driving electronics, which together with the incremen-\ntal stepping motion of the shaft, makes them ideal for several applications, particularly\nopen loop positioning/pointing devices. These types of motors can be divided into three\nmain groups:\n\n\u2022 Hybrid stepper motors\n\u2022 Reluctance stepper motor\n\u2022 Permanent magnet stepper motors\nHowever, in space applications, hybrid stepper motors are by far the most commonly\n\nused.\nThis type of motor has a high power/torque ratio (especially at low speed), maximum\n\ntorque in the region of 5\u201310 Nm, number of steps per turn between 50 - 1 200 (for\nmotors with an external diameter between 15\u2013150 mm) and a speed between ten and a\nfew hundred steps per second. Reluctance stepper motors have a poor torque/power ratio.\nThey are, however, much simpler devices, which makes them suitable for applications\nworking in cryogenics conditions.\n\nStepper motors are very versatile as both drive and servo prime movers and find frequent\napplication in spacecraft systems. For the Giotto de-spin application, the motors are 1200\nstep-per-revolution steppers but run in the synchronous mode at 14 rpm.\n\nAll the motors considered so far are rotational devices. Spacecraft mechanisms, how-\never, often require linear motors. These often use the same principles exploited in rota-\ntional motors, and they are usually grouped into two categories:\n\n\u2022 Short stroke linear motors , with a stroke length usually shorter than 50 mm, generally\nhave a single phase winding which makes the electronic control relatively easy.\n\n\u2022 Long stroke linear motors , with a stroke longer than approximately 50 mm, which is\nachieved by exploiting multi-phase windings.\n\nMotors for space are often designed specifically for each application since performance,\npower consumption, heat dissipation and materials must all be closely controlled. Adapting\ncommercial motors for space is acceptable only in conjunction with a very stringent\nevaluation program. See References [16, 17].\n\n\n\n516 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\n15.4.2 Slip rings\n\nThere are a number of space mechanisms where an electric current must be transmitted\nacross a rotating joint, the solar array drive being a typical example, and in this case \u2018slip\nrings\u2019 are needed. These may be axial, as in Figure 15.12, or radial in the form of a disc,\nbut the material requirements are the same. The brush material must have good electrical\nconductivity, a low wear-rate and a self-contained lubrication system. Graphite cannot be\nused as it becomes an abrasive in vacuum. Several compact materials based on copper,\nsilver and molybdenum disulfide with a wear-rate between 10?14 and 10?15 m3/ Nm have\nbeen widely used, but a lower wear-rate would be preferable for long-life mechanisms\nsince the control of \u2018wear debris\u2019 in space is a growing problem. The ring material is\nnormally copper, plated with gold or silver, although the latter suffers too readily from\nsulfide contamination in air.\n\nOil can be used as a lubricant but must be only vestigial. In one case of dry-lubricated\nslip-rings in a 60 rpm de-spin mechanism, the wear-rate of the brushes was markedly\nreduced by oil vapor from the liquid-lubricated bearings. The mechanism ran on test for\nover six years.\n\nHoneywell have developed their Roll-Ring design to the stage at which it can be used\nwith confidence in low speed applications. The concept is based upon a flexible hoop\nrolling between the stationary and rotating elements to carry the current.\n\n15.4.3 Gears and bearings\n\nThese two machine elements may be discussed together. They are both essential compo-\nnents of a variety of space mechanisms and their technologies are both critically dependent\non tribology and materials selection.\n\nSpace gearboxes differ from industrial units of similar size in their much reduced\npermissible tooth-loading and their limited choice of both lubricant and material pairing.\nThe tooth module, defined as the pitch circle diameter divided by the number of teeth,\nwill define the tooth size. As a general rule the minimum module is 0.08 but the choice\nis a balance between tooth load, accuracy of transmission and gear ratio.\n\nThe two types of tooth stress governing performance are the contact, or Hertzian, stress\nand the bending root stress. In practice the former has been identified as the more important\nin failures because it also controls the sub-surface shear stress and, by implication, the\nfatigue failure. A useful rule of thumb is to limit the tooth load of metal gears to a\nmaximum of 10 N per mm tooth width, and to reduce this figure by a factor of 10 for\nplastic wheels. Metallic materials for gears include carbon, stainless and maraging steels,\ncast iron, bronze, aluminium and titanium, with suitable surface treatments. Favoured\nplastics are polyimide and polyacetal, often loaded with molybdenum disulfide or carbon\nfibre. Plastic gears should always run against metal gears, usually stainless steel, although\naluminium and titanium are sometimes used.\n\nThe lubrication of lightly-loaded plastic gears is usually achieved by the incorporation\nof a solid lubricant such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or molybdenum disulfide in\nthe plastic. For heavily-loaded metal gears the choice is between thin films of soft metal,\ne.g. gold or lead, or molybdenum disulfide. Grease and oil may also be used but control\nagainst migratory loss will be needed.\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS 15.4 517\n\nSometimes it is possible to achieve redundancy in a gear drive by incorporating a\ndifferential gear, one half of which is locked and released only if the other half should\nseize. Such complexity can only be justified in very critical systems. It is well to remember\nthat a gearbox is nearly always reversible, and achieving true irreversibility, even with a\nworm gear, can be very difficult.\n\nHarmonic Drives are often used in space. These are characterized by very high trans-\nmission ratios with a high torque capability, together with high positioning accuracy\n(virtually zero backlash) and repeatability [18]. The first major space application of Har-\nmonic Drives was in 1971, on the Lunar Roving Vehicle of the Apollo 15 mission, and\nsince then they have been used quite frequently where compact and powerful positioning\ndrives are required.\n\nThe principle of operation of these devices, illustrated in Figure 15.19, is relatively\nsimple and it is based on three mechanical components: the wave generator, the flexspline\nand the circular spline which are shown in Figure 15.20. The flexspline is basically a\nflexible gear that is deformed into an elliptical shape by the wave generator. The wave\ngenerator rotates inside the flexspline forcing the teeth of the latter to mesh with those of\nthe circular spine which is fixed (thus acting like the case of a gear box). The manner in\nwhich this functions is illustrated in Figure 15.19, and highlighted by the movement of\nthe black dot which is fixed to the flexspline. In this case, after half a turn of the wave\ngenerator the flexspline has rotated only 1/48 of a circumference which corresponds to a\n\nFigure 15.19 Harmonic Drive principle of operation\n\nWave Generator Flexspline Circular Spline\n\nFigure 15.20 Harmonic Drive basic components and final assembly. (Reproduced by\npermission of Harmonic Drive AG)\n\n\n\n518 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\ntransmission ratio of 24:1. In practice the number of teeth of real devices is much higher,\nand it is possible to reach transmission ratios from 30 up to 320:1.\n\nFor bearings , the application of the apparently simple ball-bearing to space mechanisms\nmight be thought to be a straightforward adaptation, but it has taken more than thirty years\nof research and more than two million hours of testing in vacuum to reach the present\nstate of knowledge, and there is still more to be learnt. Speed, load, reverse rotation,\ntype of cage, material and both wet and dry lubrication exert major influences on the\nperformance of this machine element. The duty cycle and life required of the bearing will\nbe important in the choice of these factors. Temperature, particularly thermal gradients, is\nmost important; the thermal conductivity of a liquid-lubricated bearing can be ten times\nthat of one with dry lubrication. The warning must be never to use a ball-bearing in a\nspace mechanism without the guidance of a space tribology expert (see Section 15.6).\nPlain bearings are also used in space but almost exclusively for one-shot systems. They\nare always dry-lubricated and polymer-metal pair based. Spherical rod end bearings are\nwidely used in deployable elements to avoid high friction from thermal distortion. They\nmust always be validated for space since some commercial materials are unacceptable.\nReference [19] is a good, general survey and [20] is important reading too.\n\n15.4.4 Sensors\n\nUnless operating completely open loop, which is rare, an electro-mechanical system will\nembody a sensor, and the choice of this device will be crucial to the success of the system.\nThe angle over which it must operate will limit the choice. Some sensors, such as the\npick-offs used in gyros, are extremely sensitive but operate over very small angles. Others\nsuch as synchros, resolvers, stepper-motors, and encoders can be used over 360?. Optical\nencoders are commonly used in space, their development commencing in the 1950s. In\nits simplest form an optical encoder consists of a collimated light source (often a light\nemitting diode, LED), a rotating code disk (with transparent and opaque radial segments),\na grating element (or slit plate) and one or more light detectors. The code disk is attached\nto the element whose rotation has to be determined, whilst all the other elements are fixed.\nThe light beam propagates from the LED through the code disk, to the grating device and\nfinally to the detector. The rotation of the code disk produces interruptions of the light\nbeam, and from the pattern of these interruptions it is possible to determine the position\nof the disk. The optical encoders used on the Hubble Space Telescope have an accuracy\nbetter than 1 arcsec.\n\nThere are many factors to be considered in the choice of a sensor since many sensors\nare very sensitive to mechanical stability and thermal distortion, particularly over the\nlonger lives now being demanded. Mechanically robust devices such as resolvers can be\nvery attractive for this reason. Wear can ruin a mechanical contact encoder and optical\nunits are dependent on the reliability of the optical elements.\n\n15.4.5 Release devices\n\nPyrotechnics have always been, and still are, the principal elements for releasing space\nmechanisms [21, 22]. They are very energy efficient (better than 10 kJ/g), operate very\nrapidly (less than 10 ms) and, when well engineered, are very reliable. Space pyrotechnics\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS 15.4 519\n\nalways have two initiators for each charge and fully redundant firing circuits. The pressure\ngenerated by combustion is used to operate a simple mechanical device such as a pin-\npuller or pin-pusher, cable-cutter or valve-actuator. They can, of course, only be operated\nonce and are then discarded, which seriously limits ground and pre-flight testing. They\nare also difficult to seal hermetically, although there have been a number of successful\ndesigns using deformable capsules or bellows. Safety is a very important aspect and in\nthe early days there were incidents in which stray currents and electrostatic discharge,\neven from the human operator, caused untimely ignition. This led to the need for elaborate\nprotection systems to absorb electrostatic discharge, which are now built into the initiators\nof every space pyrotechnic.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of pyrotechnics is the mechanical shock produced by the explo-\nsion of the charge. Pyrotechnics are in fact forbidden in some spacecraft (e.g. spacecraft\nwith \u2018delicate\u2019 optical elements such as the Hubble Space Telescope), and memory metal\nactuators are often used alternatively as activation devices. Here, the metal, an alloy of\nnickel and titanium, can be deformed into a new shape (basically the material undergoes\na phase transformation between austenitic and martensitic states) below a critical trans-\nformation temperature. On heating above this temperature (which is less than 100?), the\nshape changes back to the original. If this change of shape on re-heating is restrained,\nthen the alloy can be used to generate a significant force capable of doing work which,\nin turn, can be used to operate a mechanism. On the HST it was used to release the\noff-loading system of the SAD.\n\nPractical examples of how this phenomenon is exploited in real mechanisms are the\nFrangibolts produced by the TiNi Alloy Company, which are commonly used in space-\ncraft. The mechanism, schematically represented in Figure 15.21, exploits the expansion\nof the shape memory alloy to produce an extra tension in the already loaded bolt, which\nconsequently breaks the bolt across the area identified by the circular notch around its\nshank. A possible issue with this type of device is that usually there is a few seconds\nuncertainty on the exact time when the bolt will actually snap.\n\nHigh Energy Paraffin actuators are another possible release initiator. They rely for\ntheir action on the large expansion of paraffin wax when changing from the solid to the\n\nBolt\n\nnotch\n\nSeparation surface\n\nShape memory \nalloy\n\nnut\n\nFigure 15.21 Schematic representation of the three-dimensional cross section of a\nFrangibolt\n\n\n\n520 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nliquid phase. They can generate high forces and the action is indefinitely repeatable when\nthermally cycled - an important advantage in their favour. In another device, a heated\nknife is used to cut a tensioned Kevlar cable to release a solar array.\n\nThese devices take time to operate - of the order of one minute - so that simultaneous\nrelease of multiple elements cannot be guaranteed.\n\nBurn wire mechanisms have also been used, due to their simplicity, to trigger release\nmechanisms. Basically, the separate parts of the mechanism are pushed together, overcom-\ning the force of some preloading device (e.g. a spring) that tries to push them apart. These\nare then tied together by a wire (made of high strength and high resistivity material). To\nrelease the mechanism, a current is passed through the wire, heating it up and ultimately\nmelting it, thus allowing the parts of the mechanism to separate. This mechanism can be\nactuated in fractions of a second, depending on the characteristics of the wire.\n\n15.5 MATERIALS\n\nThe selection of the materials for a space mechanism is possibly the single most important\ndecision that the designer will have to make, only equalled by the selection of the lubricant.\nThe requirements follow very closely those specified for space structures and the reader\nis referred to Chapter 8. Only materials that have been validated for use in space should\nbe selected. If a new material is chosen, then the cost of validation must be accounted.\nSee [23], which is an essential guide, and the more recently published [24].\n\nBesides relatively standard aluminum alloys, aluminum beryllium alloys are very inter-\nesting for some mechanism applications due to their very high specific stiffness and low\nspecific mass. However, the toxicity of this material during machining often discourages\nits use.\n\nWhen high specific stiffness and low mass are required, carbon fibre reinforced plastic\n(CFRP) is also used, and here an appropriate lay up can also achieve a near-zero thermal\nexpansion coefficient. For some high accuracy applications where thermal stability is\nrequired, more exotic materials such as invar can offer very good performance.\n\nOf particular importance to mechanisms is stress-corrosion cracking (SCC). It is some-\ntimes necessary to use materials that are not generally recommended because of this factor.\nFor example, the bearing steel 440C, although more susceptible to SCC, is preferred over\nthe widely used 52 100 because of its better resistance to corrosion.\n\nMost mechanism parts are machined from the solid, which is very expensive. The small\nnumber required for a project, perhaps only four or six, usually precludes other production\nmethods. However, some space firms have economically used the lost wax casting process\nfor short runs.\n\nPolymers are as widely used in mechanisms as in structures. Polyacetal and polyimide\nare used for small components and, with appropriate fillers, are self-lubricating. But all\npolymers have high thermal coefficients of expansion and low thermal conductivity which\nmay be unacceptable, particularly when used with metals. Other materials such as ceramics\nare now finding application in space. Hot-pressed silicon nitride has been used for bearing\nballs and indeed complete bearings. Titanium carbide and titanium nitride are frequently\napplied to surfaces as hard coatings.\n\n\n\nTRIBOLOGY 15.6 521\n\nAll plating processes must be fully evaluated before being applied to a space mech-\nanism. Cadmium, for example, is widely used for earthbound mechanisms but is totally\nforbidden in space due to sublimation in vacuum.\n\nIn LEO, attack by atomic oxygen (see also Chapter 2) is an environmental hazard. It\nis particularly damaging to exposed polymers and can also attack the surfaces of metals\nwhich are sensitive to oxidation, such as silver.\n\n15.6 TRIBOLOGY\n\nTribology is the science of interacting surfaces in relative motion, and encompasses\nlubrication, wear, surface physics and the physics and chemistry of lubricants. Thus,\na good understanding of this science is essential for anyone pursuing the design of\nspace mechanisms.\n\nIn most cases, parts of a mechanism will move relative to each other, and to facili-\ntate this motion, and protect the surfaces against damage and wear and tear, a material\n(lubricant) is introduced in the \u2018gap\u2019 between the parts in relative motion.\n\nLubricants can be liquid (wet) or solid (dry), with greases placed in an intermediate\ncategory that is, in any case, subject to the same concerns as liquid lubricants and which,\ntherefore will not be explicitly discussed here.\n\nDry and wet lubricants are both used in space applications and each have advantages and\ndisadvantages. For example, wet lubricants will tend to evaporate and creep (with loss of\nlubricant over time) and will require a seal - however they deliver low mechanical noise.\nOn the other hand, dry lubricants will certainly have fewer problems of evaporation and\ncreeping, but debris in the lubricant is likely to produce noise. In addition, the generally\npoor thermal characteristics of dry lubricants can be disadvantageous with respect to the\nhigh thermal conductance of wet lubricants.\n\nWet lubricants\n\nIn practice, two types of wet lubricants are used today in space applications:\n\n\u2022 Synthetic hydrocarbons, that are essentially multiply alkylated cyclopentanes\n(MACs).\n\n\u2022 Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE).\n\nOne of the main parameters describing wet lubricants is viscosity, and currently avail-\nable on the market is the MAC Pennzane (synthesized hydrocarbon fluid) which comes in\ndifferent levels of viscosity (from low viscosity for low temperature applications to high\nviscosity for high temperature applications). Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) e.g. Fomblin Z,\nKrytox, Demnum and Brayco, are particularly suitable for elastohydrodynamic lubrication,\ndue to their high density.\n\nDuring operation of the mechanism there will be loss/degradation of the lubricant\nand generally the mechanism will fail when all the lubricant is gone. Although various\nstudies have been conducted on the possibility to replenish the lubricant, generally this\nis not an option.\n\n\n\n522 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nDry lubricants\n\nThere are essentially three options:\n\n\u2022 Dichalcenogides, of which molybdenum disulfide is the most useful. It performs\nbetter in vacuum than in air because it is degraded by the presence of water.\n\n\u2022 Solid lubricant composites based on polymers loaded with molybdenum disulfide\nor PTFE.\n\n\u2022 Soft metals of which lead and gold are the most effective.\n\nDry lubricants are generally applied like a thin film on the surface that needs lubri-\ncation, or bonded on the surface. However, there are also cases where components can\nbe manufactured using some self-lubricating material. For dry lubricants, it is neces-\nsary to establish the rate of wear during operation, as this will determine the life of\nthe mechanism.\n\nFor both solid and dry lubrication, accurate life prediction using ground test data and/or\nmathematical modelling is generally difficult and, as the rate of consumption of the lubri-\ncant depends on the operating conditions, the extrapolation of data from accelerated life\ntests in the lab to the space environment can be quite inaccurate.\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) has recognized the importance of tribology to\nthe reliability and integrity of space mechanisms, and has established a special facility\n- the European Space Tribology Laboratory (ESTL). Its main remit is to develop space\ntribology, and at the same time provide meticulously controlled facilities for testing\nspace mechanisms.\n\nThe following five precepts summarize the principles to be applied for successful lubri-\ncation in space:\n\n1. The optimum lubrication system is an integral part of the mechanism design and\nnot a process to be added when the design is complete.\n\n2. Avoid making the operation of the mechanism dependent upon close control of the\ncoefficient of friction.\n\n3. The lubrication process must be fully codified and documented to ensure consistent\nrepeatability of performance.\n\n4. The lubricant must be approved and validated for space to a recognized specification,\nand must be source traceable.\n\n5. The test programme to determine the performance of the lubrication system in the\nmechanism must reproduce all the operational conditions of duty cycle, life, and\nboth space and ground environments that it will experience in application.\n\nThe apparently excessive requirements of the fifth precept still represent the only\neffective means to ensure that the lubrication process will work as required in terms\nof performance and duration.\n\nGood general references on this subject are [25, 26], whereas Reference [27] covers in\ndetail all the relevant areas.\n\n\n\nTESTING AND VERIFICATION 15.7 523\n\n15.7 TESTING AND VERIFICATION\n\nFor a mechanism, meticulous testing is the only method of demonstrating the integrity\nof both the design and the build of the machine, and verifying its ability to operate over\nits designed life. Many faults can be revealed only by testing in an environment which\nsimulates the conditions that it will encounter in operation. There are no short cuts. Taking\nan APM or a SAD as examples, vacuum chambers with the ability to create thermal cycles\nand thermal gradients in a clean room environment must be provided. Perhaps one of the\nmost difficult problems during testing is to recreate the microgravity environment in which\nthe mechanism will operate. For deployable structures, a relatively standard technique is\nto suspend each segment of the structure from its center of mass (using light-weight\nwires) which compensates for the \u2018one-g\u2019 environment. Life testing, qualification testing\nand testing of individual builds are also essential and will add significant cost to the\nprogramme; they could absorb as much as 25% of the budget.\n\nFor one-shot systems of the single hinge variety, it is all too easy to accept a few\ndeployments in the laboratory as verification and then be mightily surprised when it fails\nto deploy in space due to temperature differentials. The remarks above apply equally to\nsuch systems. Failures of this type are still much too frequent.\n\nReference [28] sets out the rationale to be applied to formal testing of mechanisms,\nand covers also the mechanical environment tests. Information concerning thermal vacuum\ntesting can be found in [29, 30].\n\n15.7.1 Microvibrations characterization\n\nAlthough the microvibrations emitted by a mechanism operating on the ground will be\ndifferent from those emitted during operation in the typical space microgravity environ-\nment, it is usually acceptable to perform microvibration tests under lab conditions, taking\nappropriate measures to reduce background noise.\n\nMost often, the experimental characterization of the microvibrations emitted by mecha-\nnisms such as reaction wheels, APMs or other \u2018sources\u2019 is carried out with the equipment\nrigidly grounded (on a multi-axis dynamometer\u2014e.g. a Kistler table), by measuring the\nforces and moments transmitted to the support/ground.\n\nHowever, to completely characterize a source to allow it to be precisely represented\nwhen mounted on a supporting structure (of unknown stiffness), the accelerations\n(or velocities, or displacements) at the interface should also be measured during the\ncharacterization.\n\nAlternatively, the measurement of the forces/moments transmitted and the resulting\naccelerations can be carried out directly at the interface between the equipment and\nthe spacecraft structure. This method clearly requires the availability of the spacecraft\nstructure (or a dynamically representative model) and the results clearly will include\nprecisely the effects of the dynamic interaction between source and mounting structure.\nThe issue here is that the experimental results obtained can be used only in situations\nwhere the source will be mounted on a structure with characteristics similar to that used in\nthe characterization tests. If the test results have to be used for other dissimilar structures,\nand if accurate results are required, then the effect of the structure that was used as support\nduring the tests has to be analytically removed from the test results.\n\n\n\n524 SPACECRAFT MECHANISMS\n\nAt low frequency (< 50 Hz) the facility\u2019s noise (i.e. vibrations of the building) is\ntypically of the same order of magnitude as the signal to be measured. Therefore the\nmethods above require that the test equipment is put on an appropriate suspension system\nto isolate it from the ground noise (i.e. ground vibrations). For multi-axis dynamometers\n(force tables/Kistler platforms), a vibration isolation table (i.e. a typical modern optical\ntable implementing active/passive vibration isolation) is usually a good support.\n\n15.8 CONCLUSION\n\nMechanisms are fundamental spacecraft subsystems, necessary to perform operations that\nare crucial to the success of the mission. Currently, there are a relatively large number\nof mechanisms (e.g. spacecraft release mechanisms, reaction and momentum wheels,\nsolar array drives etc.) that have reached a certain maturity in their development, and\nthus have relatively standard designs. However, progress in engineering that produces\ncontinuous improvements and upgrades in the mechanisms design is always necessary.\nFurthermore, there will always be missions that require mechanisms with completely new\nrequirements, and their design is a challenging and exciting endeavour. This very brief\nlook at mechanisms shows the range of skills needed for their design. Specialist knowledge\nin such diverse areas as motors, sensors, pyrotechnics, tribology and structures will be\nneeded, together with a wide knowledge of materials. Testing is yet another area where\nspecialist expertise will be required.\n\nThe application of Product Assurance (PA) to mechanisms has not been addressed in\nthis chapter and the reader is directed to Chapter 19. The reliability and avoidance of\nfailure in space mechanisms depends, in no small measure, upon the strict application of\nthe principles and practice of PA throughout every stage of the design process. Meticulous\nattention to detail, the refusal to take anything for granted, and a carefully planned and\nexecuted test programme are fundamental ingredients for success. References [31\u201333]\nare important.\n\nFor the reader interested in expanding his or her knowledge of spacecraft mechanisms,\nReferences [34\u201336] are excellent sources.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe author gratefully acknowledges the considerable contribution of H.

Redford\n\nBritish Aerospace, Bristol\n\n16.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nElectromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) for a system or equipment requires that\n\n1. It does not cause interference with other systems or equipment.\n2. It is not susceptible to emissions from other systems, equipment or electrical\n\nenvironments.\n3. It does not cause interference within itself that can cause the system or equipment\n\nto malfunction or behave in an undesirable manner.\n\nEMC problems were first noticed on domestic radio receivers in the early part of the\ntwentieth century. These early vacuum-tube receivers were sensitive and able to pick up\ninterference clicks and buzzes generated by electric motors, overhead wires and connec-\ntions used in electric transport vehicles.\n\nEMC has become much more important as technology progresses. More complex elec-\ntronics performing many new functions are packed into smaller and smaller enclosures.\n\nThis trend is particularly true for space vehicles. The wide variety of communica-\ntions, weather, robotic, remote sensing and scientific spacecraft, and more recently, small\nsatellites launched as constellations, all pose complex EMC problems.\n\nThe trend has caused spacecraft contractors to impose stringent EMC requirements on\nboth spacecraft and ground support equipment.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W. Stark.\n\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n528 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\nEMC provisions for all electrical and electronic equipment have now become law in\nall EEC member countries. It is illegal to sell any electrical or electronic product without\na \u2018CE\u2019 mark certifying that the equipment meets the required European EMC standards.\n\nFurther reading on EMC can be found in References [1] and [2].\n\n16.2 EXAMPLES OF EMC PROBLEMS\n\nIn domestic situations, most people have experienced interference from car ignition sys-\ntems and on TV and radio reception. The recent discussions on the safety of operating\nmobile phones close to the brain and whether close proximity to overhead power lines\naffects health are all examples of EMC problems where one system could cause another\nto malfunction or behave in an undesirable manner.\n\nEMC is fundamental to the military sector since interference can directly affect the\noperation of military equipment and is indeed used as a weapon in Electronic Warfare.\n\nFortunately, EMC problems in spacecraft are relatively rare since major contractors\nare careful to make early EMC provisions on all projects. Most EMC problems encoun-\ntered on spacecraft result in a slightly degraded performance but some have had more\nserious effects. Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) problems between thermal blankets and the\nspacecraft structure on early maritime communications satellites were solved by care-\nful grounding. The interference from these tiny spark discharges was sufficient to cause\ntelemetry status latches monitoring the power subsystem to flip over. This initiated shed-\nding of the payload communications power until reset by ground.\n\nThese examples illustrate the importance of EMC provisions in all electronic\napplications.\n\n16.3 EMC SPECIFICATIONS\n\nEMC Requirements Specifications are derived and written for each spacecraft depending\nupon its mission and they generally contain\n\n\u2022 Spacecraft level requirements and derived subsystem/unit requirements broken down\ninto the EMC categories described later.\n\n\u2022 Details of how particular requirements are to be verified are also specified. This\nverification is done either by Inspection/Analysis or Test, and an indication is given\nof which tests are to be carried out at spacecraft/subsystem or individual electronic\nunit levels.\n\n\u2022 Design guidelines are sometimes included to address particular EMC problems. For\ninstance, if a scientific spacecraft is attempting to measure the magnetic field envi-\nronment of a planet with a sensitive magnetometer, then there may be limitations on\nthe use of magnets or magnetically permeable material in the spacecraft build.\n\nEMC test methods are generally based on the American Military Standard MIL\u2014STD-\n461 [3]. This is widely used in both Europe and the USA as a military standard for\nboth ground-based military and spacecraft electronic hardware. The standard covers EMC\nrequirements and test limits for electrical, electronic and electromechanical equipment,\nsubsystems and systems and establishes techniques to be used for measurements.\n\n\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY\u2014TERMS AND DEFINITIONS 16.4 529\n\nEMC requirements for ground support equipment used for testing at spacecraft/\nsubsystem and unit level are sometimes covered in separate requirements documents.\n\n16.4 ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY\u2014TERMS\n\nAND DEFINITIONS\n\n16.4.1 Common terms used\n\nCommonly used terminology in the EMC area is now introduced.\n\nEMC\u2014Electromagnetic Compatibility\n\nThis is a general term addressing all categories of electromagnetic emissions and suscep-\ntibility. It is generally split into four areas:\n\n\u2022 Radiated emissions measures all electric or magnetic fields emitted from the\nequipment.\n\n\u2022 Conducted emissions measures all power, analogue and digital signals that are\nconducted via cables, harnesses and structural parts of the spacecraft.\n\n\u2022 Radiated susceptibility measures the ability of the spacecraft to operate satisfactorily\nwhen placed in an environment that contains externally generated electric or\nmagnetic fields.\n\n\u2022 Conducted susceptibility measures the ability of the spacecraft to operate satisfac-\ntorily when externally generated conducted interference signals are directly injected\ninto the spacecraft\u2019s harness cables or structure.\n\nEMI\u2014Electromagnetic Interference\n\nThis is a general term referring to conducted and radiated EMI produced by a system.\n\nRFI\u2014Radio Frequency Interference\n\nA more specific version of EMI referring to emitted radio frequency electric\nfields\u2014generally in the Radio frequency (RF) bands from 3 KHz up to 3000 GHz.\n\nESD\u2014Electrostatic discharge\n\nAn ESD will occur if two equipments or systems that are electrostatically charged at\ndifferent potentials are brought together.\n\nA lightning strike on a spacecraft launch vehicle or a spark ignition on a car engine are\nboth examples of ESDs. ESDs to the human body can sometimes be felt when touching\nelectrostatically charged car bodies.\n\nTwo main effects have to be considered when an ESD occurs:\n\n1. The effect of the spark discharge that generates radiated electric and magnetic fields.\n\n\n\n530 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\n2. The effect of the resultant conducted discharge current through the equipment or\nsystem. This discharge can rise to hundreds or sometimes thousands of amperes\nflowing at the ESD point in a very short period.\n\nEMP\u2014Electromagnetic Pulse\n\nThis is the intense electromagnetic wave produced when a nuclear detonation occurs. It\nis characterized by extremely high electric and magnetic fields occurring in an extremely\nshort period.\n\nIt was first noticed about 1943 when electronic equipment used to monitor the first\natomic bomb explosions were destroyed by the EMP.\n\nNuclear \u2018hardening\u2019 has since become a significant requirement for all strategic military\nequipment, government communications equipment and critical electronic systems.\n\n16.5 EMC FUNDAMENTALS\n\n16.5.1 The basic EMC problem and its solution\n\nAll EMC problems have these aspects in common:\n\n1. a source or transmitter that produces emissions,\n2. a receiver that receives the emissions,\n3. a transfer or coupling path between transmitter and receiver.\n\nInterference occurs if the received signal causes the receiver to misbehave in\nsome way.\n\nThere are three possible means to reduce the interaction between the transmitter\nand receiver.\n\n1. Reduce the transmitted emissions.\n2. Alter the coupling path between the transmitter of interference and the receiver by\n\nphysical separation.\n3. Make the receiver less susceptible to the interfering signal.\n\nClearly, reducing the transmitted emission is the most desirable since this is the cause\nof the problem. However, this is not always possible.\n\nFor example, the prime function of a telemetry transmitter on a spacecraft is to generate\nan RF signal and to send it to Earth via an antenna on the spacecraft. The transmitted\npower is governed by the link budget and the performance of the spacecraft and ground\nsystems. Primary RF emissions cannot, therefore, be reduced for EMC reasons.\n\nIn contrast, a Switch Mode Power Converter also generates RF emissions. However,\nits primary purpose is usually to convert direct current (DC) power to different regulated\nvoltages. It is, therefore, very important, and possible, to try to reduce the secondary RF\nemissions from the converter, even if this makes the converter slightly less efficient.\n\nAltering the coupling path between transmitter and receiver by physical separation can\nbe effective in some cases. An example of this can be found on the Ulysses Spacecraft.\nOne of its functions is to measure the magnetic environment around the polar regions\n\n\n\nEMC CATEGORIES 16.7 531\n\nof the Sun. The Magnetometer sensor is mounted on a 5.6 m radial boom to minimize\nmagnetic interference from the spacecraft body.\n\nFinally, the third option of making the receiver less susceptible to the transmitted\ninterference is almost always possible. Examples of this are filters on spacecraft electronic\nunits\u2019 interfaces to eliminate conducted interference from pulses on power and signal lines\non the spacecraft.\n\n16.6 THE SYSTEMS APPROACH TO EMC\n\nOne of the most important aspects of EMC is that it must be considered as an integral\npart of the specification, design, manufacturing and testing phases of any spacecraft.\n\nA \u2018top down\u2019 systems approach to EMC must be adopted at the same time that the\nbasic requirements of the spacecraft are defined and specified. This involves examining\neach aspect of the spacecraft mission requirements, considering how each EMC category\nis influenced and deriving detailed EMC requirements and specifications.\n\nSystem margins and budgets are attached to EMC performance in the same way as\npower budgets are applied to Power Systems or pointing budgets are allocated to Attitude\nand Orbit Control Systems.\n\n16.6.1 Safety margins for EMC\n\nThese margins are defined as the difference between system susceptibility levels and the\nlevel of system emissions.\n\nFor instance, the electronics units mounted on a spacecraft platform will be required to\nperform their required function in the presence of RF emissions back scattered from the\ntelemetry transmitter antenna sending signals to Earth. The systems designer may have\ncalculated the worst case field strength emission from the transmitter at any location on the\nspacecraft as, say, 1 V/m. However, in the susceptibility specification for other electronic\nunits the designer may impose a requirement that the \u2018units shall not be susceptible to a\nfield strength of 10 V/m\u2019. The designer has then assigned a 20 dB (\u00d710) safety margin\nbetween the emission and susceptibility specifications.\n\nThe size of this margin may reflect\n\n1. the uncertainty in the designer\u2019s calculations,\n2. that there are perhaps several \u2018sources\u2019 of interference from several equipments that\n\ncan \u2018add up\u2019 at system level,\n3. the criticality of the subsystem or equipment.\n\nGenerally, the size of the margin between susceptibility and emission is at least 6 dB\n(\u00d72) but it could be as high as 20 dB for safety critical systems such as pyrotechnic\nrelease mechanisms or military systems.\n\n16.7 EMC CATEGORIES\n\nAs introduced in Section 16.4.1, EMC categories can be split into radiated and conducted\nmain areas, each of which can be further subdivided into emissions and susceptibility as\nshown in Figure 16.1.\n\n\n\n532 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\nRadiated\n\nPower lines\n\nDifferential \nmode\n\nDifferential\nmode\n\nCommon\nmode\n\nCommon\nmode\n\nSignal lines\n\nConducted\n\nEMC categories\n\nRadiated emissions or radiated susceptibility Conducted emissions or conducted susceptibility\n\nElectric\nfields\n\nDC magnetic\nfields\n\nAC magnetic\nfields\n\nFigure 16.1 EMC categories\n\n16.7.1 Radiated emissions\n\nRadiated emissions are electric fields and AC or DC magnetic fields, which are emitted\nfrom either the subsystem units, or from the harnesses and cables that interconnect\nthe subsystems.\n\nElectric fields\n\nThese are radio waves generated by RF transmitters or signals radiated from the wires in\nelectronic units and associated interconnecting harnesses acting as small antennae. They\nare formally defined as sinusoidal RF radiations in volts per metre over a frequency range\n3 KHz to 3000 GHz. On most spacecraft, they are usually of concern only in the 15 KHz\nto 30 GHz region.\n\nRF emissions are measured on a Spectrum Analyser using a variety of different antennae\nto pick up emissions. The equipment under test and the antennae are enclosed in a screened\nroom to avoid external EMC influences.\n\nElectric field emissions can be reduced as follows:\n\n\u2022 Adopting a good grounding and screening philosophy for the equipment or subsystem\nunder test.\n\n\u2022 Choosing the slowest digital and analogue technologies consistent with the\nmission objectives\u2014particularly on interface circuits between subsystems and\nelectronic units.\n\n\u2022 Effective shielding of all cables, harnesses and connectors both inside units but,\nmore importantly between units. This is done by the use of screened wires and\nconnector shrouds, coaxial cable, twisted wire, overall shielded braids on wires, wire\nbundles and so on. Almost all Electric Field emission problems can be minimized\nby adequate shielding and grounding of harnesses, cables and connectors between\nunits and subsystems.\n\n\u2022 Effective shielding and grounding of all electronic units by encasing all units in metal\nscreened boxes or enclosures. Holes or apertures in units should be minimized and\nlid-fixing screws should be close together to avoid apertures. In extreme cases, RF\n\n\n\nEMC CATEGORIES 16.7 533\n\ngasketing material can be used between adjacent metallic parts (e.g. lids/access parts)\nalthough this is only effective in the higher frequency ranges above a few MHz.\n\n\u2022 Metal parts/panels should be electrically bonded together\u2014giving typically less than\n10 mohms resistance between adjacent parts.\n\nDC magnetic fields\n\nThese are fixed DC magnetic fields, usually measured in units of PicoTeslas at 1 m\ndistance. They do not vary with time and are produced by permanent magnets or DC\ncurrents flowing in any circuit. Their magnitude is important, and should be minimized\non scientific spacecraft that use magnetometers to measure magnetic field environments. It\nis impossible to construct a spacecraft that does not have some level of DC magnetic field,\nand so if sensitive measurements are required, the magnetometer sensors are generally\nmounted on booms several metres in length, away from the spacecraft body.\n\nDC Magnetic Fields can be reduced by\n\n\u2022 minimizing the use of ferromagnetic or permeable materials,\n\u2022 reducing DC currents and minimizing the loop area around which they flow.\n\nIn practice, this cannot be perfectly achieved. For instance, transformers, inductors and\nrelays rely on ferromagnetic material. Flow control valves and latch valves controlling gas\njets for attitude control purposes contain magnetic material. Even the mounting cans and\nconnecting wires on integrated circuits and transistors are made of magnetically permeable\nnickel alloy.\n\nCompensating magnets, or magnetic screening using \u2018Mu-metal\u2019 alloy material, can be\nused with some success in critical applications. DC magnetic fields can be further reduced\nby \u2018de-perming\u2019 the electronic units. This generally involves placing the unit in a coil that\nis energized to produce an AC magnetic flux density and slowly reducing this field to zero.\n\nAC magnetic fields or B fields\n\nThese are alternating magnetic fields that vary with time (AC) and are produced by\ninductive circuits such as transformers, inductors, and, indeed, any wire loops or circuits\nin which alternating current flows. They are also measured in PicoTeslas at 1 m distance.\nAC magnetic fields are mostly of concern in the 50 Hz to 100 KHz frequency region.\nAbove 100 KHz, electric fields tend to become more important than magnetic fields.\n\nAC magnetic fields can be reduced by adopting the following methods:\n\n\u2022 Reducing the magnitude of AC currents in the equipment and harnesses.\n\u2022 Reducing the loop area around which these AC currents flow. If this is not possible,\n\nthen cancellation or screening techniques can be used\u2014although usually only with\nlimited success. Some reduction can also occur if cancellation techniques or \u2018shorted\nturns\u2019 are used. A copper strap around the outside of a transformer body is an\nexample of \u2018shorted turns\u2019 that do not affect basic transformer action. However, any\nstray external magnetic field present will induce currents in the strap that will, in\nturn, produce a compensating magnetic field.\n\n\n\n534 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\nMagnetic Screening with Mu-metal can sometimes be effective but only at frequencies\nless than about 1 KHz. Magnetic Fields tend to be very directional and some EMC\nproblems can be minimized by simply physically moving or rotating the offending source\nof interference.\n\n16.7.2 Radiated susceptibility\n\nUnits or subsystems can be caused to malfunction or to be susceptible to the presence of\nradiated AC or DC magnetic or electric fields.\n\nThese externally applied fields can be picked up on the harnesses and cables between\nsubsystems or in internal wiring of the units themselves. These induced signals can pro-\nduce conducted signals in the units and cables that can cause circuit functions to fail\nmomentarily. In extreme cases, electrical interfaces can be permanently damaged.\n\nSusceptibility testing is essentially the reverse of testing for emissions. RF power,\nfrom generators that can be swept over the required frequency range, is fed to a variety of\nantennae to radiate the equipment or spacecraft under test. Field strengths at the equipment\nunder test are generally measured first. Then the equipment is switched on in its most\nsensitive mode to detect any susceptibility.\n\n16.7.3 Conducted emissions\n\nThese are generally split into emissions from power lines and signal lines and are further\ncategorized into Differential Mode or Common Mode signals as shown in Figure 16.1.\n\nNoisy circuits and components inside a subsystem can cause conducted emissions to be\npresent on both signal and power lines between units on the spacecraft. These emissions\ncan also be conducted to ground via the chassis, case or screens in cables between units.\n\nMeasurements are made directly using voltage or current probes monitoring conducted\nsignals, and these can be displayed on an oscilloscope or spectrum analyser.\n\nThe difference between a differential mode and a common mode signal is now explained.\nFigure 16.2 shows a typical signal interface between subsystems in which, for example,\ndigital data is being sent from Subsystem 1 to the data-handling subsystem (Subsystem 2)\nfor subsequent transmission to ground.\n\nSubsystem 1 Subsystem 2Differential mode current probe = I1\nSignal\ndrivers\n\nSignal\nreceiver\n\nCommon mode current probe = I1 ? I2\n\nI1\n\nI2\n\nFigure 16.2 Differential mode and common mode signals\n\n\n\nELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE 16.8 535\n\nMost power, analogue signals and digital signals are transmitted between subsystems\non \u2018two wire\u2019 interfaces since any common interference present is equally induced on\nboth wires. This is termed \u2018common mode noise\u2019 . The signal sent on one wire is designed\nto be complementary to the other, that is, if a logic \u20181\u2019 digital signal level is sent on one\nline then a logic \u20180\u2019 is transmitted on the second line. The interface circuit receiving the\nsignal or power is designed only to look at the relatively interference-free signal between\nthe two wires to detect the logic state or signal transmitted. The common mode current\nbetween the two subsystems is the algebraic sum of the currents flowing in the two wires.\nTwo-wire interfaces are also commonly used for analogue signals and for distributing\npower around the spacecraft, using the same principles.\n\nIn the diagram, the differential current can be measured using a current probe around\neither wire and measures either I1 or I2. Common mode current is measured with a current\nprobe around both wires so that the net forward current measured is (I1 \u2013I2.). Similar\ndefinitions apply to differential and common mode voltage signals between interfaces.\n\n16.7.4 Conducted susceptibility\n\nUnits or subsystems can be caused to malfunction or to be susceptible to the presence of\nconducted signals on the spacecraft harness or structure.\n\nThese externally applied voltages and currents are injected directly into the harnesses\nand cables between subsystems or directly on the unit\u2019s connector pins. These signals can\ncause a temporary malfunction, commonly called a \u2018glitch\u2019, or in extreme cases, electrical\ninterfaces can be permanently damaged.\n\nSusceptibility testing is essentially the reverse of testing for conducted emissions.\nSinusoidal and pulse signal generators, which can be swept over the required frequency\n\nrange, are used as signal sources. These signals are power amplified and injected via cur-\nrent probes, transformers or voltage probes directly into the equipment or spacecraft under\ntest. Applied signals are generally measured with an oscilloscope before the equipment\nis switched on, in its most sensitive mode, to detect any susceptibility.\n\n16.8 ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE\n\nThis is similarly categorized into two areas, radiated and conducted.\n\n\u2022 When an ESD occurs, there is always a \u2018spark\u2019, for example, lightning. The spark\ndischarge occurs between two bodies or parts of a spacecraft\u2014for example, a human\nbody and a car door handle. The occurrence of the spark can generate a very large\nbut extremely short duration burst of electric and magnetic radiated emissions over a\nwide frequency band. It is easy to confirm this by listening to any radio set tuned to\nthe Medium or Long Wave bands during a thunderstorm. If any equipment, harnesses,\nwires or cables are close to this spark discharge, these fields will induce currents and\nvoltages in the wires and equipment. This can cause either a temporary malfunction\nor, in some cases, permanent damage to equipment interfaces.\n\nTesting for ESD radiated susceptibility involves generating a spark discharge of known\nenergy usually 30 cm from the equipment and its connecting harnesses, and monitoring\nthe equipment for any temporary or permanent malfunction.\n\n\n\n536 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\n\u2022 The secondary effect of an ESD is the conducted current and path of the ESD.\nThe magnitude of this current can be up to 50 000 A with rise times in the order\nof nanoseconds to microseconds. If this conducted current is applied at equipment\ninterfaces, or even discharged through an electronic unit\u2019s case, then this can cause\neither a temporary malfunction or permanent damage to the equipment.\n\nTesting for ESD conducted susceptibility generally involves directly injecting current\npulses from spark discharges, or directly from amplified pulse generators, into the equip-\nment structure, harnesses and connector bodies and monitoring for any susceptibility.\n\nThe proximity of charged particles in the environment around any spacecraft can cause\ncharge to build up on any isolated conductive surface. An account of this on-orbit charging\nmechanism can be found in Reference [4]. ESD problems can be eliminated by avoiding\nthis charge build-up by grounding and bonding all parts of the spacecraft to the structure.\n\nThe importance of ESDs has increased as technology progresses. Vacuum tubes had\nan extremely high immunity to ESDs. Semiconductors used in spacecraft, particularly the\nhigh impedance metal oxide silicon (MOS) devices, can be very sensitive to even the\nsmallest ESDs caused simply by handling the device without the appropriate precautions.\nDischarges of about 3.5 kV can occur from the fingers of an engineer and they are of such\na short duration that they cannot be seen or felt. However, these discharges can easily\ndestroy sensitive semiconductor devices, some of which are susceptible to voltages as\nlow as 50 V.\n\nFor this reason, spacecraft clean rooms and manufacturing areas take special precau-\ntions and use grounded conducting floors, benches and chairs to minimize any possi-\nble charge build-up. Wrist straps are also used to connect personnel to ground during\nhandling operations.\n\n16.9 SPACECRAFT GROUNDING SCHEMES\n\nSeveral fundamental questions need to be asked during the initial design phases of\nany spacecraft:\n\n\u2022 What types of digital and analogue signals pass between the subsystems of the\nspacecraft, between subsystems and payloads, and what are the data transmission\nrates and bandwidth requirements of each of these signals?\n\n\u2022 How much power is supplied by the spacecraft power subsystem to different parts of\nthe spacecraft and payload and in what form? For example, are there direct supplies\nat main bus voltage levels in either regulated or unregulated form, or converted and\nregulated supplies distributed at lower or higher voltage levels?\n\nAnswers to these questions may perhaps already be known, since they may be customer-\nspecified, or perhaps earlier studies may have answered them. For instance, data rates\nbetween the scientific payload of an (earth resources satellite) and the data-handling\nsubsystem telemetering data to ground may be hundreds of Megabits per second. In con-\ntrast, communications satellites may only be telemetering a small amount of background\nhousekeeping data.\n\nSimilarly, spacecraft with active microwave payloads such as a synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) may consume kilowatts of power and would therefore be directly supplied by main\n\n\n\nSPACECRAFT GROUNDING SCHEMES 16.9 537\n\nbus power at voltages generally in the range of 28 to 120 V. Small satellites may supply\npayloads and subsystems with common converted and regulated supplies at, perhaps 5 V\nand 12 or 15 V levels.\n\nA Spacecraft grounding scheme defines how all analogue and digital data signals and\npower are distributed and referenced on a spacecraft. All systems have a reference point\nor points to which all electrical signals and power is referred. This is usually called \u20180 V\u2019,\n\u2018earth\u2019, \u2018common\u2019, \u2018ground\u2019 or \u2018chassis\u2019.\n\nOn any spacecraft, all these common points would be at the same potential, in an ideal\nworld, regardless of whether signals in the system are \u2018Direct Current\u2019 (DC), (e.g. power\nbuses), or Alternating in nature (AC) such as digital data signals between subsystems. In\npractice this is not true. Two points \u2018grounded together\u2019 with a direct wire connection, or\nperhaps via a conducting spacecraft structure, will not be at the same \u20180 V\u2019 potential. It\ndepends on the currents that pass along the wire or structure, and their frequencies.\n\nFor example, if a DC current of 1 A is flowing in a 24 gauge ground wire of 10 cm\nlength, there will be a very small potential difference between the two wire ends of,\nperhaps, 10 mV\u2014the wire resistance would be 10 mohm from Ohm\u2019s Law. However,\nif AC signals are flowing in the ground wire at a frequency of 10 MHz, the wire will\nhave a significant impedance\u2014perhaps 10 ohms\u2014due to the inductance of the wire. A\nmuch larger potential difference will exist if 1 amp flows in this wire at 10 MHz, in this\ncase 10 V. Therefore, the two points apparently \u2018grounded together\u2019 with this wire for\nDC currents are not at the same potential at this frequency due to the wire inductance.\n\nThis example shows how essential a grounding scheme is to define all interfacing and\ngrounding, and to pass only defined signals and power along defined paths or interfaces.\nThis will minimize cross talk between signals (or power supply voltages) by minimizing\ncommon paths for the signals and power.\n\nComputer calculations or estimations can also be made of the potential (DC) or noise\n(AC) at any point in the system with respect to a spacecraft ground point. A grounding\nscheme diagram is an essential aid to achieving these objectives.\n\nThere are three common ground schemes used on Spacecraft:\n\n\u2022 Single-Point Grounding (SPG) Scheme.\n\u2022 Multipoint Ground (MPG) Scheme.\n\u2022 A Hybrid SPG/MPG Scheme.\n\n16.9.1 Single-point ground (SPG) scheme\n\nThe example of an SPG scheme showing power and signal connections between two\nsubsystems on a spacecraft is shown in Figure 16.3.\n\nAn SPG scheme has the following features:\n\n\u2022 There is only one 0 V reference point to which all power and signals on the spacecraft\nare referred.\n\n\u2022 Main Bus Power is fed to each subsystem by a \u2018twisted pair\u2019 set of wires.\n\u2022 All signal and return wire currents pass down wires and therefore, no currents appear\n\nin the spacecraft structure. This is important particularly on some scientific satellites\n\n\n\n538 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\n(e.g. the European GEOS and Ulysses spacecraft), which contained plasma wave\ndetecting instruments sensitive to interference from spacecraft structure noise.\n\n\u2022 Note that the 0 V lines are grounded to the 0 V reference point at only one point on\nthe spacecraft. This connection is usually made close to the Power Subsystem but\ncan sometimes be located near the Data-Handling Subsystem.\n\n\u2022 The single-ended digital signal transmitted between subsystems will be on slightly\ndifferent logic \u20181\u2019 and logic \u20180\u2019 levels since points A and B will be at slightly\ndifferent potentials. The signal current path shown indicates that both points A and\nB, in Figure 16.3, will have \u2018AC\u2019 signal frequency noise present because of the\nsignal current flowing, and the \u2018AC\u2019 impedance between the 0 V point and A, and\nbetween the 0 V point and B. In practice, this is not a serious problem since logic\nchip integrated circuits have built-in \u2018noise immunity\u2019. However, if many signals\nat very high frequencies are passing between the two subsystems, then the noise\nat these points with respect to the reference 0 V level could be sufficient to cause\nproblems. This noise can cause distortions in the shape of the rise and fall time\nedges of digital signals. This gives rise to \u2018glitches\u2019 or interference pulses on signals\nbetween subsystems as the noisy signals cross and re-cross the logic \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019\nthreshold levels. On modern spacecraft, these problems are invariably overcome\nby the use of differential drivers and receivers as shown in Figure 16.2 above, or\nby the increasing use of opto-coupled interface circuits. These pass information by\nswitching infrared signals on and off. Opto-couplers, therefore, eliminate the flow of\nelectrical signal currents between subsystems and are immune to noise on ground\npoints between subsystems. However, they are usually not as fast for data-transfer\npurposes as conventional interface circuits.\n\nA similar situation exists when analogue signals are passed between subsystems\u2014for\nexample, analogue telemetry signals monitoring currents and voltages, or those monitoring\ntemperatures using thermistor sensors. Two wire interfaces are commonly used although\n\nPower\nsubsystem\n\nDC main\nbus\n\nMain bus\nreturn\n\nSingle-point ground\nconnected to spacecraft\nstructure\n\nSubsystem 1\n\nSubsystem 2\n\nConverter\n\nConverter\n\nIsolation\n\nIsolation\n\n+5 V\n\n0 V\n\n+5 V\n\n0 V\n\nA\n\nB\n\nSignal return wire\n\nSignal return wire\n\nSignal current flow between subsystems\n\nSignal\ndriver\n\nSignal\nreceiver\n\nFigure 16.3 Single-point ground (SPG) scheme\n\n\n\nSPACECRAFT GROUNDING SCHEMES 16.9 539\n\nthey are often grouped with common return lines to minimize wires between subsystems\nand reduce harness mass.\n\nIn general, screened/twisted pair cables are used in the harness between units for both\nanalogue and digital signals to minimize radiated emissions and susceptibility problems.\n\nThe main disadvantage of the SPG scheme is that, for large systems, the ground leads\ncan be numerous and long, making the harness quite heavy. Although ideal for low\nfrequency systems or distributing DC power, this can sometimes create problems since\nat higher frequencies, signal currents flowing in long wires can cause significant radiated\nemissions. These problems can be solved by using a MPG Scheme.\n\n16.9.2 Multipoint grounding (MPG) scheme\n\nAn MPG scheme grounds all signal and power wire returns locally to a common ground\nplane. This ground plane has very low inductance between any two points on its surface\nand so ground currents flowing, even at very high frequencies, will not produce significant\nnoise above ground potential on any part of this plane.\n\nThe ground plane is a flat, thin and wide conductor preferably made of plated copper.\nHowever, it could be any large, flat, and thin conductive surface\u2014like the aluminium\nhoneycomb structure used for many spacecraft platforms. This geometry gives a very low\ninductance between any part of the ground plane.\n\nSeparate flat, wide and thin conductive strips made from plated copper are used as a\nground plane for those spacecraft that have carbon fibre structures, since carbon fibre has\na comparatively high electrical resistance compared to aluminium.\n\nIf many signal interfaces are grounded locally to this ground plane, then many signal\ncurrents will flow in the ground plane but the effect of these is negligibly small since\nthe inductance of the plane is so low\u2014that is, \u2018Almost ideal\u2019 ground points are created\nthroughout the spacecraft.\n\nFigure 16.4 shows an example of an MPG scheme.\n\nPower\nsubsystem\n\nDC main\nbus\n\nMain\nbus\nreturn\n\nSubsystem 1\n\nSubsystem 2\n\nGround plane\n\nConverter\n\nConverter\n\nIsolation\n\n+5 V\n\n0 V\n\n+5 V\n\n0 V\n\nSignal\ndriver\n\nSignal\nreceiver\n\nA\n\nB\nIsolation     Signal\n\nand power returns\nlocally grounded to\nthe ground plane\n\nFigure 16.4 Multipoint ground (MPG) scheme\n\n\n\n540 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\nThe grounds of logic chips on Subsystem 1 are closely coupled to those of Subsystem\n2 by direct connection locally to the ground plane. This will allow interface circuits to\noperate at much higher frequencies (>30 MHz) using faster logic families. Note that\nit is still good practice to use differential drivers, receivers and screened cables and, if\npossible, opto-coupled interfaces between subsystems.\n\nThere may be several ground planes in a spacecraft, some inside the individual elec-\ntronic units in each subsystem. For example, there may be separate planes for logic signals,\nsensitive analogue signals and high current digital drives for motors and solenoids. These\nprecautions are taken to minimize cross coupling between radically different systems han-\ndling different signals. For example, the logic family ground plane may be handling 0 to\n5 V logic signals with several milliamps of current in the ground plane. In contrast, the\nseparate ground plane for motor drive or switch mode power converter circuits may be\nhandling 50 V signals with 1 amp spikes induced in the ground plane.\n\n16.9.3 Hybrid SPG/MPG scheme\n\nIt is common on spacecraft to adopt a hybrid-grounding scheme to take advantage of the\nbest of both systems. For example, a typical strategy may be an MPG scheme for all\ndigital signal transfers with separate ground planes for, say, high current digital drives,\nand an SPG scheme for the distribution of power and analogue signals. The SPG point\nand the many MPG points are shown in Figure 16.5.\n\nThis gives the advantage of the good high frequency performance of the MPG\nscheme together with the excellent isolation and elimination of ground loops for low\nfrequency/analogue or power supply lines of the SPG system.\n\nPower\nsubsystem\n\nDC main\nbus\n\nMain\nbus\nreturn\n\nSPG for\npower\ndistribution\n\nSubsystem 1\n\nSubsystem 2\n\nConverter\n\nConverter\n\nIsolation\n\nIsolation\n\n+5 V\n\n0 V\n\nGround plane\n\n+5 V\n\n0 V\n\nSignal\ndriver\n\nSignal\nreceiver\n\nA\n\nB\n\nMPG for\nfast digital signals\n\nFigure 16.5 Hybrid SPG/MPG scheme\n\n\n\nMAJOR CAUSES OF SPACECRAFT EMC PROBLEMS 16.10 541\n\n16.10 MAJOR CAUSES OF SPACECRAFT EMC PROBLEMS\n\n16.10.1 Power supplies\n\nPower supplies, particularly Switch Mode Power Converters, are usually major causes of\nEMC problems on any spacecraft. These generally convert main bus DC supplies down\nto other regulated voltages for use in subsystems, payloads and individual electronic\nunits. They operate by first converting the DC input voltage into a rectangular AC signal\nusing transistor power switches operating at frequencies up to several MHz. The AC signal\nproduced is then applied to a transformer to produce several different AC voltages, before\nconverting it back to new DC levels. A typical converter in a Data-Handling Subsystem\nunit would generate one 5 V and two 12 V supplies from one 28 V DC main bus input.\n\nThe speed of operation of the switching transistors and the use of magnetic components,\ncombined with high voltages and circulating currents, gives rise to electric and magnetic\nfield emissions at the fundamental switching frequency, and most of its harmonics. RF\nradiation can extend into the tens or even hundreds of MHz regions if adequate precautions\nare not taken.\n\nThe most effective way of reducing radiated interference from these converters is to\nreduce the radiations at source by slowing down transistor switching speeds. Reduction\nof transient voltages and currents, which are inevitably associated with the conversion\nprocess, is also necessary. In addition, close attention must be paid to the printed circuit\nboard, unit layout and screening provisions as described in Section 16.7. Early testing\non prototype models will identify any problems, since circuit layout problems are very\nexpensive to fix after flight models of equipment have been manufactured and delivered.\n\nConducted interference currents, either to chassis or to other wires on the spacecraft,\nare also significant in these converters. Fast transistor switching times and large voltage\nhandling can cause currents to be coupled, via stray capacitance effects, into the spacecraft\nstructure or other wires. Since capacitance is inversely proportional to proximity, these\nproblems are exacerbated by the trend towards smaller and smaller power supplies. Close\ncoupling of heat generating components to chassis, to minimize thermal problems, can also\ncause these problems. In addition, stray capacitance between transformer windings can\ncause interference to pass back along main bus power leads or out to the converter loads.\n\nCopper foil shields between windings can reduce these problems. Also, a careful choice\nof inductive and transformer components can reduce magnetic field leakage problems.\n\nDiodes are used to convert the high frequency AC signals back to DC. The fast on-off\nswitching of these rectifier diodes can also cause some problems by producing radiated\nemissions at harmonics of the converter switching frequency. Special circuits called\n\u2018snubbers\u2019 (usually a capacitor and resistor across each diode) can slow down the\nswitching times of diodes to reduce this problem.\n\n16.10.2 DC motors and actuators\n\nThe inductive nature of motors and actuators, the pulse width modulated nature and fast\nrise/fall times of the drive signals mean that these components have very similar EMC\nproblems to switch mode power supplies. The resultant voltage and current waveforms\n\n\n\n542 SPACECRAFT ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY ENGINEERING\n\nand their harmonics can cause both radiated and conducted interference. Similar avoidance\ntechniques are required.\n\n16.10.3 Harnesses and cables\n\nA significant percentage of all radiated and conducted emissions and susceptibility prob-\nlems appear to be caused by the spacecraft harness. However, the harness is completely\npassive and cannot, by itself, either generate or be susceptible to conducted or radiated\nsignals. It can radiate emissions and conduct electrical signals that are placed on the\nharness by electrical transmitters and receivers located at either end of the cable.\n\nElectric and magnetic field emissions from harnesses and also, susceptibility to these\nsignals can be minimized by\n\n\u2022 Adopting a suitable grounding and bonding scheme for the systems.\n\u2022 Partitioning and physically separating harnesses into power, pyrotechnic, noisy (dig-\n\nital) and quiet (analogue) signals.\n\u2022 Paying careful attention to interface circuit designs, and where necessary, using\n\nmatched drivers, transmitters and cables such that cables look like transmission lines.\n\u2022 Matching the required electrical characteristics of each transmitted signal with the\n\ncapabilities of the associated driver circuit, the harness wire characteristics, and\nreceiver interface circuit properties. For example, for an interface transmitting digital\nsignals between subsystems, this means slowing down logic signal rise and fall times\nas logic levels change from \u20180\u2019 to \u20181\u2019 and vice versa . It also means designing the\nslowest driver and receiver interface circuits, which, together with the harness wire\ncharacteristics, will successfully transmit these signals. Slowing down these signals,\nand also reducing the voltage and current levels used, prevents unwanted noise and\nassociated harmonics appearing on the harness wires for subsequent electric and\nmagnetic field radiation. Special filter connectors can also be used to slow down or\nfilter signal and power lines.\n\n\u2022 Using individual screened or twisted cables between signal interfaces, and making\nelectrical connection to any screen ends inside metal backshells on the connectors at\neither end of the interface. In critical cases, overall shielding or braid can be fitted\nand electrically bonded with conductive tape to conductive backshells on connectors.\n\nConducted emission on harnesses depends critically on interface circuit designs and the\noverall grounding scheme adopted for the system or equipment.\n\n16.11 ANALYSIS METHODS FOR SPACECRAFT EMC\n\nENGINEERING\n\nComputer analysis of radiated electric and magnetic fields is notoriously difficult since it\nrelies heavily on accurate physical models of the environment. It is difficult also to predict\nwith precision the nature of the frequency and time-domain interference that occurs. This\nis the reason most spacecraft contractors rely on preventative measures during the design\nphases, and early EMC testing and analysis of test results to characterize and identify\nproblems early in the spacecraft development.\n\n\n\nREFERENCES 543\n\nAnalysis of conducted interference, using well-tried analysis software such as\nPSpiceR [5], is much more successful and is widely used. The input and output response\nof filters on power lines, interface circuits on both digital and analogue lines, and\ngrounding diagrams are easily and accurately modelled and predicted using these\ncomputer programs. In addition, it is easy to generate computer simulations of a wide\nvariety of interfering sinusoids and pulse signals to test the conducted susceptibility of\nall conducted power and digital/analogue interfaces. Differential responses to interfering\nsignals can also be accurately predicted.\n\nHowever, care must be taken when trying to predict the common mode responses of\ninterfaces. Correct simulation relies heavily on correct models of stray capacitances and\ncouplings of harnesses to each other and to the chassis.\n\nCare must also be taken at frequencies above the 10 to 100 MHz region, since com-\nputer models of particular components may not be representative at these frequencies and\nbeyond. A good example of this is the response of low frequency analogue circuits to\nRF radiation in the GHz region. Unless adequately screened, these RF fields can make\nsmall changes to the DC characteristics and offsets of the integrated circuits used. This\nproduces unexpected changes in analogue circuit performance.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Clayton R.

Here we\ndiscuss AIV (Assembly, Integration and Verification)\u2014the engineering discipline that\nverifies to a very high level of confidence and probability that the hardware will perform\nthe desired mission. The AIV process includes the assembly of many components, parts\nand manufactured subsystems, followed by the integration and test of the flight spacecraft.\nThis is the most visible part of the hardware stage of the programme and is generally\nknown as AIT (Assembly, Integration and Test).\n\nThere are however many other processes and tasks that contribute to the verification\nobjective. Verification processes are at work from the beginning of the design stages.\nFirst we will look at the concepts and terminology used in the field of AIV. We will then\nshow how, by careful planning, the verification (and test) activities are incorporated into\nthe overall spacecraft programme\u2014not just between manufacture and launch, but from\nthe beginning of the project development phase. We will see how Verification Planning\ndetermines or influences programme logistics\u2014the number of hardware items needed to\nfulfil verification objectives, the provision of test facilities and test equipment, and how\nverification tasks occupy a significant proportion of the project schedule.\n\n17.2 SOME DEFINITIONS\n\nAn understanding of the following terms and concepts will help the understanding of the\nverification process.\n\nAssembly \u2014the process of mechanically bringing together hardware components,\nlarge and small, from many suppliers to build up the deliverable spacecraft.

Put simply this means making sure it all\nworks together. Each and every interface between two components needs to be shown\nto be correct. Does the power go to the right place? Is the output voltage of unit A\nwhat unit B expects? Does unit B draw the anticipated current? Are the individual data\nmeasurement points encoded and sampled into the correct telemetry packets?\n\nIntegration covers more than electrical signals though. We need to check, for example,\nthat fields of view of sensors and deployment envelopes are free of obstruction (with some\nmargin). Furthermore, integration includes verifying the system-level software/hardware\ninterface. These might appear to be simple issues that should have been resolved early in\nthe design stage. However, when components are delivered from a number of different\ncontractors, errors and misunderstandings can, and do, occur. This is the time to discover\ninterface discrepancies.\n\nThe integration phase ends with a known functional configuration.\nVerification \u2014the total process by which conformance to all applicable performance\n\nrequirements are demonstrated. Verification should be seen as the sum of two\nmain objectives:\n\n\u2022 The first is Qualification \u2014demonstrating that the spacecraft design is fully capable\nof meeting all the applicable requirements, i.e. that it is suitable and adequate for the\nplanned mission with proper margins. That means that qualification tests (see later)\ninclude an element of \u2018over test\u2019 relative to the flight environment.\nQualification does not necessarily need the flight hardware\u2014any hardware properly\nbuilt to the flight design standard can be used in the qualification process. Qualifica-\ntion can be transferable. That is, a design that has been previously qualified, especially\nif it has been flown, is automatically qualified for a future mission\u2014provided the\nnew mission environments are no more severe than the earlier mission. Conversely,\nthe same design proposed for a new environment must be re-qualified.\n\n\u2022 The second objective is Acceptance \u2014demonstration that the end product, the flight\nhardware, is free from workmanship and materials defects, that no errors have been\nintroduced during assembly and integration. A most important prerequisite to accep-\ntance is confirmation that the flight hardware has been built to the qualified design.\n\nDifferent methodologies may be applied to different disciplines and requirements, at\ndifferent stages in the build programme. Often they are used in combination with each\nother. There are four principal verification methods:\n\n\u2022 Test \u2014the preferred method of verification which involves (a) the stimulation of\nhardware with inputs representative of an outside influence, or simulation of an out-\nside environment (e.g. vibration, temperature, light or radiation sources) and (b) the\nmeasurement of the response in the form of an electrical signal (from the spacecraft\nor from non-flight sensors fitted temporarily), physical motion or telemetry data.\nEach test result is expected to be within a specified range of values. Often we are\nlooking for the absence of a response to a stimulus (things that should not happen).\n\n\n\nTHE VERIFICATION PLAN 17.3 547\n\nThe test phase also includes the taking of measurements \u2014for example determining\nthe mass properties of the spacecraft (mass, centre of gravity), and pointing directions\nby measuring alignment parameters.\n\n\u2022 Analysis \u2014if verification by test or other means is not physically possible or pro-\nhibitively expensive, analytical techniques\u2014mathematical modelling and computer\nsimulation\u2014are used. A subtype of analysis is similarity \u2014where a requirement can\nbe verified by direct, but detailed, parameter by parameter comparison with another\nmission, item of hardware or an earlier test.\n\n\u2022 Inspection \u2014a method of verification that determines conformance to specified\nconstructional features, engineering drawings, physical features and workmanship\nstandards. Standard laboratory metrology equipment can be used. Inspection includes\nwitnessing by Quality Assurance personnel that specified processes are used.\n\n\u2022 Review of Design \u2014a method of verification that looks at approved design reports,\ntechnical descriptions and engineering drawings, along with evidence of the valida-\ntion of the processes that contributed to those documents, to show unambiguously\nthat the requirement is met. One application of review of design is to show that\na previously-used equipment design is shown to be qualified and that no further\nqualification analysis or testing is required.\n\nVerification level \u2014the level within the hardware architecture at which the relevant\nverification is performed. Subject to detailed planning, this can be at spacecraft level,\nmodule or subsystem level, unit, equipment or component level.\n\nIn this chapter we will generally describe the AIV of a spacecraft. The spacecraft may\nhowever comprise a Service Module and a Payload Module, and each of these will be\nan assembly of various subsystems and units (\u2018black boxes\u2019) and equipments (deployable\nbooms, antennas and solar panels) mounted on the main structural component. The AIV\nprocesses will be allocated to module, subsystem, unit or component level for a number\nof reasons:\n\n\u2022 It is generally better to detect anomalies, faults and failures as early in the programme\nas possible for easier rectification.\n\n\u2022 Contractual arrangements require the manufacturer of a unit or equipment to prove,\ndemonstrate and document the performance of their hardware at the time of delivery.\n\n\u2022 Testing of smaller items is easier and cheaper and often more practical\u2014because\nspecialized test facilities large enough to accommodate the whole spacecraft may not\nbe available.\n\nThere is always a need to frequently re-verify throughout the programme to ensure that\nperformance is maintained, and that failures have not occurred. There is nothing better,\nat the end of the day, than a final, comprehensive test that demonstrates that the flight\nassembly (the spacecraft that will be launched) is \u2018ready to go\u2019.\n\n17.3 THE VERIFICATION PLAN\n\nThe flow diagram shown in Figure 17.1 is derived from ECSS-E-ST-10-02C [1], the\nappropriate standard for Verification Engineering, of the European Cooperation for Space\nStandardization (ECSS). Other space agencies have similar standards.

At the top are the customer requirements , comprising not only the\noperational phase mission-specific requirements, but many applicable requirements too.\nThe latter include customer-specified suppliers, test facilities or launcher systems, the\ninterface to the ground segment, range safety requirements, international protocols (e.g.\nITU), standards for manufacturing processes\u2014and many more.\n\nRight from the start of the project, the AIV engineering team will begin to analyse\nthe requirements to identify programmatic and cost drivers (facility procurement costs or\nlong test durations, for example) and to plan the verification programme. The first task is\nto prepare the Verification Matrix , within which all requirements are listed. For each and\nevery requirement, a number of decisions are made.\n\nFirstly, how will the requirement be verified? This is the verification method - analysis,\ntest, review of design or inspection.\n\n\n\nTHE VERIFICATION PLAN 17.3 549\n\nSecondly, at what stage will the requirement be verified? This is the verification level-\nspacecraft level, module, subsystem or equipment level.\n\nAt the same time, where will the verification take place? We need to ensure that appro-\npriate test facilities will be available when needed, especially if they must be developed\nor upgraded.\n\nVerification by test is chosen wherever possible for safety-critical and mission-critical\nfeatures. It is a direct and visible demonstration or measurement of performance\u2014as\nlong as it can produce clear go/no-go results. Does each test measurement fall within an\nacceptable range of results, or not? But verification by test alone is not always practical,\nnor can it cover all possible mission scenarios within a reasonable timescale. Taking the\nexample of a planetary lander, a representative landing site (a sandy or rocky surface)\nmight be found or constructed somewhere on the Earth\u2019s surface. It is not however feasible\nto completely verify a parachute landing system from atmospheric entry to soft touchdown\nin a continuous \u2018end-to-end\u2019 test sequence if gravity and atmospheric parameters are not\nEarth-like.\n\nHence, alternative, or complementary, methods of verification by analysis are needed.\nAnalysis will start early and will initially distinguish the good designs from those that will\nnot work. The whole spacecraft and mission is analysed before any hardware is manu-\nfactured. More detailed mathematical modelling and simulations are then developed with\nthe aim of representing the many environments in which the spacecraft must operate - the\nexternal stimuli such as mechanical induced loads or thermal radiation and conduction (and\nconvection if in a planetary atmosphere). Models are improved and re-run as the detailed\ndesign of the spacecraft progresses to incorporate the known characteristics of chosen\nmaterials, subsystem designs and configurations, and the outcomes of technology devel-\nopments. Thus the behaviour of the spacecraft is predicted. Out-of-specification results\nare investigated to determine if the modelling is wrong or if the design is inadequate.\n\nJust as testing is not always a practical option, so analysis may be too complex,\nor the modelling may be uncertain so that confidence in the results may not be high\nenough. Therefore, analysis and testing usually work together to contribute to verification.\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 Analysis of spacecraft performance can be supported by the test results of lower-level\nequipments.\n\n\u2022 Analysis predicts test results, and a comparison between predicted and actual mea-\nsurements or observations can be made. If they do not agree, maybe the analytical\nmethods need changing, or perhaps the as-built design has not been adequately\nrepresented in the model. Or, ultimately, the design is not good enough.\n\n\u2022 Once modelling has been developed, it can be re-run at moderate cost. Tests can be\nexpensive and time-consuming to repeat. On the one hand a test should only be run\nwhen sufficient confidence in the modelling has achieved. On the other, there does\ncome a point when it is vital to \u2018test something\u2019 to get physical measurements and\nresults, rather than to perform analysis after analysis.\n\nA basic requirement is that any analysis must itself be validated . Initially this may be\nthrough previous application and experience and by rigorous testing of the analysis itself.\nUltimately it is the agreement of predicted results and actual test results that clinches\nit\u2014at which point the mathematical model can be declared to be \u2018validated\u2019.\n\n\n\n550 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nIt is worth remembering here that the validated modelling will continue to be used\nthroughout the mission at the control centre to predict in-orbit performance. Validating\nthe model is as important as verifying the spacecraft.\n\nThen, when all the requirements to be verified by analysis or test (or both) have been\nidentified, Review of Design or Inspection are assigned to the remaining appropriate\nrequirements.\n\nThe first draft of the verification matrix is thus completed, but it is hardly ever straight-\nforward. A further distinction needs to be made in the verification matrix between activities\nthat contribute to either qualification or acceptance, or both. Qualification will draw heav-\nily on test and analysis methods, which explore all aspects of the planned mission, using\na range of test environments. Since the primary aim of acceptance testing is to detect\nworkmanship and materials faults in the flight hardware (and to eliminate them), there\nare fewer activities. They are primarily tests and inspections, and the tests need only look\nfor go/no-go results rather than gathering extensive data. That said, sufficient data needs\nto be recorded to characterize flight performance. Then, a number of particular aspects\nof the programme should be looked at before the matrix is finalized. They may arise as\na result of on-going equipment level design. These include:\n\n\u2022 Design peculiarities\u2014what\u2019s different or new? The design can drive the verification\nprocess. Size is important. Are test facilities large enough and capable enough for a\nlarge, heavy spacecraft? Does a large spacecraft (e.g. Envisat or Newton) need to be\nseparated into modules for test and transportation? Are facilities clean enough for a\nbiologically-clean planetary lander? Maintaining cleanliness of large optical mirrors\nwas a driver for assembly and test of the Herschel spacecraft (see Figure 17.2).\n\nFigure 17.2 The Herschel spacecraft during alignment measurements on its mirror\nsystem. Optical and thermal surfaces demand strict control of cleanliness. (Photo: ESA,\nAnneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANALYSIS AND TEST 17.4 551\n\n\u2022 Are the necessary verification tools and techniques available? These might be hard-\nware (test and metrology equipment) or analytical tools. If they do not exist, they\nmust be developed (and verified in their own right), or alternative methods sought.\nCan we achieve the cryogenic temperatures needed to verify noise levels in the\ndetectors of an infrared telescope? How can we simulate (in test or by modelling) a\nmicrogravity environment?\n\n\u2022 What is the qualification status of the hardware? Has it undergone, and passed, a\nqualification process before? For the same environments? If it has, then no further\nqualification is needed. If it has been qualified but flown in a different environment,\nthen it needs to be re-qualified for the new environment. The term \u2018delta-qualification\u2019\nis used in intermediate cases\u2014perhaps the hardware needs to be qualified by test for\nthe mechanical environment but not for the thermal environment (perhaps because a\ndifferent launcher is to be used to place a spacecraft into the same orbit as a previous,\nsimilar mission).\n\nAnswering questions such as these may modify the initial verification matrix; but there\nis still more planning to do!\n\n17.4 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANALYSIS AND TEST\n\nIt is recognized that there is no test that truly and completely represents the mission\nenvironments. For many years mechanical testing was performed one linear axis at a\ntime. But test facilities now test in three axes concurrently, and even with six degrees of\nfreedom\u2014closer to reality, but never an exact simulation of the launch regime.\n\nIn the case of thermal control, there are many mission phases with considerably different\nthermal conditions to consider\u2014launch, transfer orbit, apogee and perigee, and eclipse and\nsunlight modes. In elliptical orbits the thermal environment changes slowly throughout the\norbit period, but the transition between sunlight and eclipse is sudden. Thermal conditions\nchange between beginning of life and end of life as the thermal control surfaces degrade.\nA planetary probe will experience many more thermal scenarios\u2014en route and at the\ndestination planet.\n\nIt is not practical to test the thermal control performance in each and every flight\ncase, and certainly not for the long durations of some phases. Test facilities use lamps\nto simulate the Sun, and nitrogen-cooled shrouds to represent cold views to space\u2014they\nare not the \u2018real thing\u2019. Thus, the logic depicted in Figure 17.3 applies:\n\n\u2022 Mission scenarios are listed and modelling used to predict the performance of the\nthermal control subsystem for all mission cases.\n\n\u2022 The flight cases that are to be tested (i.e. the test cases) are selected. They are likely\nto be the more critical or complex flight cases, and certainly any for which there is\nuncertainty in the modelling. Representative transition modes between test cases are\nalso specified. Where there is a high level of confidence in the modelling, testing\ncan be minimized.\n\n\u2022 The flight modelling is adjusted for the test cases by including the calibrated per-\nformance and characteristics of the thermal balance test facility\u2014such as the lamp-\nsimulated \u2018solar\u2019 input, and the view factors of surfaces that \u2018see\u2019 chamber shrouds\ninstead of deep space (which in some directions may be obscured by test fixtures).\n\n\n\n552 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nAgreement\n\nDesign Analysis\n(Flight Case) and\nFlight Predictions\n\nIdentify & Define\nTest Case\n\nDesign Analysis\n(Test Case) and\n\nTest Result\nPredictions\n\nHardware Test\n\nCompare Test\nResults with Test\n\nPredictions\n\nDisagreement \n\nTest OK\nModelling\nValidated\n\nInvestigate,\nDetermine Reason\n\nModify Modelling\nand/or\n\nModify Hardware\n(Retest if necessary)\n\nModify h/w and retest\n\nRevise model\n\nRevised Flight\nPredictions\n\nFigure 17.3 Relationship between analysis and test\n\nThe effects of conducted heat \u2018leaks\u2019 through test fixtures and test cables is factored\nin. The performance of the thermal control subsystem in the test cases is predicted.\n\n\u2022 The hardware thermal test cases are run to provide actual test results. Test results\nare compared against the test case predictions.\n\n\u2022 If they agree, the modelling is considered to be validated. If not, anomalies and\ndisparities will be investigated. If the test results are within specification, but not\nas predicted, the modelling will be investigated until the anomaly is explained, and\nnew flight predictions obtained from the revised model. If a test result is outside its\nspecified range, either (1) the specification can be revised to accommodate minor\ndiscrepancies or (2) the hardware will need to be changed by redesign in some\nway. Then the modelling will be changed to reflect the new design, and re-run\nto revise flight predictions. Depending on the severity of discrepancies and design\nmodification, some retesting may be required.\n\n17.5 THE AIV PLAN\n\nIn practice, the spacecraft prime contractor will employ a number of subcontractors, each\ncontributing hardware or software to the programme. The prime contractor is responsible\nfor the planning and execution of an efficient but effective AIV programme across the\nproject to:\n\n\u2022 Ensure all partners and subcontractors are aware of their responsibilities to contribute,\nat their particular levels and using agreed methods, to the verification objectives.\n\n\u2022 Assemble and integrate the hardware/software in a logical sequence. The planning\nwill determine required delivery schedules for incoming equipments as well as the\ndelivery of analytical results and modelling. It should also include some contingency\nto be able to react to delays and problems at equipment level.\n\n\u2022 Schedule and perform a programme of tests, inspections and measurements of the\nhardware to support the verification programme. Test programme planning includes\n\n\n\nTESTING: GENERAL 17.6 553\n\nprovision of suitable test facilities, test and servicing equipment, test instrumentation,\ntransportation planning and staff training.\n\n\u2022 Perform sufficient \u2018health checks\u2019 on the product\u2014moving it around, subjecting it\nto transport loads or spurious conditions can damage the hardware and induce faults.\nHas a sensor or thruster been knocked out of alignment during movement or test?\nHas the propulsion system \u2018sprung a leak\u2019?\n\n\u2022 Detect adverse \u2018trends\u2019 in performance\u2014a gradual decline in battery capacity with\nuse, or calibration changes in temperature sensors over time?\n\n\u2022 Clearly demonstrate\u2014to the customer, launch service providers and others\u2014the\nsuccessful completion of the key stages of qualification and acceptance, at all\nverification levels.\n\n\u2022 Ensure that all necessary activities can be completed in order to meet launch dates.\nLaunch dates may be driven by scientific needs\u2014interplanetary launch windows\nfor example. A commercial telecommunications satellite customer will suffer loss\nof revenue if the spacecraft operational status is delayed. The longer a spacecraft is\nunder test, the more the cost increases.\n\n\u2022 Record and document all verification results, analyses, measurements and conclu-\nsions. Acceptance test data are needed not only to demonstrate flight readiness but\nare also used by the mission operations centre to characterize the in-flight hardware.\n\n\u2022 Implement precautions in test planning to ensure, at all times, the safety of the\nspacecraft hardware, and of the personnel who are working with it. A spacecraft\nmay contain a number of pyrotechnic devices, deployment mechanisms, charged\nbatteries, high voltages and high current sources, RF radiation and radioactive iso-\ntopes. Propulsion systems are pressurized, the fluids are toxic (and even nitrogen is\nan asphyxiant). Wrongly designed or badly maintained lifting equipment can cause\nhardware to drop\u2014possibly onto someone.\n\n\u2022 Ensure and continually confirm that activities similar to the above are performed\nby lower-level contractors on deliverable hardware, and that all test, analysis and\ninspection records are delivered with the hardware to the spacecraft assembly stage.\n\n\u2022 Ultimately, deliver the product to the customer on time and within cost constraints.\nIt is important for the planning process to understand at which point contractual\ndelivery will take place. A scientific or Earth observation spacecraft is, in Europe,\ngenerally delivered to an institutional customer prior to shipment to the launch site.\nThere may well be some verification activities that have not been completed at that\nstage, so they will carry forward into the launch preparation phase, and/or to in-orbit\nverification phases with the agreement of the customer. More usual for a commercial\nprogramme and a commercial customer, contractual delivery is with the spacecraft\nin a fully operational state, after an in-orbit commissioning phase.\n\n17.6 TESTING: GENERAL\n\nIn summary, then, we have seen that the Verification Plan defines how each requirement\nwill be verified. It is now necessary to plan the AIT programme to include all activities\nthat wholly or partly require some aspect of testing.\n\nLooking back at Figure 17.1 we can see that the Verification Plan leads to test planning\nthat includes:\n\n\n\n554 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\n\u2022 Test specifications \u2014exact definitions of how each of many different tests will be\nperformed and what measurements are required from them.\n\n\u2022 Facility planning \u2014specifying and verifying the performance required of the facility\nand all interfaces between the test hardware and the facility.\n\n\u2022 Transportation planning \u2014how the test hardware will be moved between test\nlocations.\n\nAt the same time, requirements will be developed for a range of specialized test equip-\nment, transportation, handling and storage equipment\u2014everything needed for the test\nstage. There may be specific requirements for facilities and equipment to maintain clean-\nliness, to protect optical, thermal and other sensitive surfaces and sensors or to implement\nplanetary protection requirements. Are there specific hazards? Are special test rigs needed\nfor deployment testing of large antennas and solar panels in a gravity field?\n\nIt is worth noting that the spacecraft has to \u2018testable\u2019. It is quite acceptable for the\nAIT engineer to request that the spacecraft design incorporates provision for efficient test\nset-ups. It may be necessary to include \u2018hard\u2019 lifting and handling points into the structure\ndesign, or to wire test connections from units to the outside skin of the spacecraft, so that\nit is not necessary to remove access panels.\n\nRequirements for the testing of space hardware are comprehensively specified in Europe\nby the standard ECSS-E-10-03A\u2014Space Engineering, Testing [2], and similar standards\nwithin other agencies. That document is applicable at all levels of testing\u2014down to\nequipment level. All levels of testing contribute to the whole, and the principles are\nsimilar at different levels. Here however we will concentrate on spacecraft-level hardware\ntest activities.\n\n17.6.1 Assembly and integration\n\nEventually, hardware arrives in the AIT facility, and assembly and integration can begin.\nThe first task is to assemble and integrate equipments and subsystems into an operational\nsystem according to the design build standard and test objectives.\n\nAs part of this activity, sensors, thrusters and antennas will be aligned relative to\nthe spacecraft axes, and the alignment parameters recorded. Functionality of deployable\nequipment will be verified after installation on the spacecraft structure.\n\n17.6.2 Functional and performance testing\n\nThe key test following the integration stage is the Integrated System Test (IST)\u2014a test\nthat verifies the performance of all the elements working together at spacecraft level,\nin all operational modes. It includes redundant elements, back-up modes and foreseen\ntransitions between operational states, and is generally performed in a sequence that\nreflects the mission sequence\u2014launch, transfer orbit, final orbit, and so on. The IST is\nsometimes known as the System Functional Test (SFT). The test will be repeated again\nat the end of the test campaign. Often it will be performed part-way through the test\nprogramme, after a series of mechanical tests, but before the start of thermal testing.\n\nA related test is the Integrated System Check (ISC), or Abbreviated Functional Test\n(AFT)\u2014 a subset of the IST that aims to test all major electrical and electronic functions\n\n\n\nTESTING: GENERAL 17.6 555\n\nin order to verify, within a reasonably short duration, that the spacecraft has survived\na given test environment. It is therefore performed after each environmental test, (e.g.\nbetween individual mechanical tests) and when appropriate during an environmental test\n(while the environment is being imposed). Similarly Mechanical Functional Tests are\nperformed on mechanisms, deployables, valves, and other moving parts at similar stages\nin the environmental test sequence.\n\nThe first IST sets the baseline against which the results of later ISTs and ISCs are com-\npared, to identify any trends in performance that might indicate wear or aging effects, or\nto detect failures induced during the test programme (and to clearly identify the particular\nactivity that caused the failure).\n\nIn the same way that the IST and ISC tests are repeated at intervals, so alignment\nmeasurements and leak checks are performed at the same stages to detect damage\nor degradation.\n\n17.6.3 Test Reviews\n\nIt is important that the build standard of the spacecraft during formal tests is accurately\nknown and recorded for every formal test. This is checked at a Test Readiness Review\n(TRR). The TRR also checks that the test facility and test equipment, procedures and\npersonnel are ready and gives the go-ahead to start testing. The build standard is important.\nNo matter what efforts are made to ensure that test hardware is flight representative, some\ndeviation from the ideal is likely. Thermal blankets or close-out panels may be absent\nduring some tests to allow access to test connectors. Test accelerometers, strain gauges,\nthermocouples and other instrumentation and cables will be fitted. These are predictable\nand acceptable differences. They are specified in the test specifications, incorporated into\nthe Design Build Standard for the test and reflected in test planning.\n\nSometimes the Design Build Standard cannot be achieved. A piece of equipment may\nnot be available because of a schedule delay, or because of failure. It may remain absent,\nor it may be replaced by an equivalent item. Provided the deviation from the required\nbuild standard does not prevent test objectives being achieved, the test can continue. The\nkey task then is to record in fine detail, for every stage in the test programme, the Actual\nBuild Standard for comparison against the Design Build Standard. Every item present in\nthe spacecraft build is recorded, by part and serial number, so that they can be represented\nin test-case modelling activity and post-test analysis.\n\nAfter each test, a (post-)Test Review Board (TRB) convenes to review the results and\nto ensure that any anomalies are properly assessed. It is the TRB that authorizes the\ndismantling of the test set-up\u2014or orders a retest.\n\n17.6.4 Environmental test\n\nWhen the first IST has been satisfactorily completed, the hardware is ready for the environ-\nmental test phase \u2014in which (a) overall system survival and performance is demonstrated\nduring and after exposure to simulated flight conditions, (b) analysis and tests combine\nto validate modelling and (c) workmanship and material defects are identified.\n\nHow are workmanship or materials faults detected? For example, vibration or acoustic\nnoise tests quickly identify loose bolts and connectors, and stress points in wiring and\n\n\n\n556 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nstructural items\u2014put simply, something will break or come loose and audibly rattle.\nOtherwise resonances and high amplitude displacements will be recorded by test instru-\nmentation. Large surface areas (e.g. sunshields, shrouds, antenna dishes) are particularly\nprone to breaking loose or \u2018flapping\u2019 in the presence of acoustic noise. Video recordings\nduring test runs are useful tools for observing the effects.\n\nThermal cycling tests (repeated cycling between hot and cold extremes) cause thermal\nexpansion and contraction and will disclose problems such as dry solder joints and bad\ngrounding connections. Throughout the environmental test phase, measurements are com-\npiled into a spacecraft database\u2014how does telemetry data change according the external\nenvironment, or in response to a telecommanded change of state?\n\nThis collection of data characterizes and calibrates the hardware, and is delivered to\nthe ground segment as a reference data set during the operational life of the mission.\n\n17.6.5 Margins\n\nA number of margins are applied throughout design and testing, to arrive at the worse\ncase extremes of the test environment (including the qualification levels). We can use\nequipment temperature levels as an example. The specification of test margins (see\nFigure 17.4) begins with the predicted temperature range during service life. This is\nbounded by the upper predicted temperature (worst case) and the lowest predicted tem-\nperature (worst case).\n\nThere will be uncertainties in the thermal control performance since materials from\ndifferent manufacturing batches may have different characteristics, and there will be some\nuncertainty in calculations, for example. Hence a thermal control uncertainty factor is\nadded to the predicted cases. This may be 10?C (if verification by test) or 15?C (if\n\nPredicted temperatures during life\n\nEnvironmental design margin\n\nEnvironmental design margin\n\nMaximum expected temp\n\nUpper temperature limit (max acceptance test temp)\n\nLower predicted temp (worst case)\n\nThermal control uncertainty 10\u00b0C or 15\u00b0C\nUpper predicted temp (worst case)\n\nThermal control uncertainty 10\u00b0C or 15\u00b0C\nMinimum expected temp\n\nLower temperature limit (min acceptance test temp)\n\nMaximum qualification test temp\n\nMinimum qualification test temp\n\nResidual margin\n\nResidual margin\n\n(1)  Thermal design range\n\n(2)  Equipment design environment\n\n(1) (2) \n\nFigure 17.4 Temperature limits and definition of margins\u2014derived from\nECSS-E-10-03A [2]\n\n\n\nTEST TYPES 17.7 557\n\nverification by analysis), and it sets the \u2018maximum expected temperature\u2019 and the \u2018lowest\nexpected temperature\u2019.\n\nThe specified flight acceptance test levels are based on these expected temperature\nextremes, and a residual margin of up to 5?C set above and below them. The qualification\ntest temperatures are then defined as 10?C above and below the acceptance levels. It is\nimportant to recognize that the thermal control subsystem has then to be designed to\nwithstand and to perform at the qualification test levels\u2014the greatest extremes to which\nthe hardware will be exposed.\n\n17.7 TEST TYPES\n\nIn this section, we look in some detail at the majority of the tests and measurements\nthat must be included in a qualification (Q) or acceptance (A) test programme. Test\nmethods, test arrangements, measurement and instrumentation methods, and the tolerances\napplicable to test inputs and to test measurements are described and specified in detail\nin the standard ECSS-E-10-03A. The list below is not necessarily complete\u2014it does not\ninclude tests applicable to manned missions, aerodynamic environments and planetary\nlanding, which require specific considerations on a case-by-case basis and specific tests\nto be developed.\n\nStatic Strength (Static Load) tests (Q) determine whether the design of load-bearing\nstructures will sustain quasi-static and dynamic accelerations, induced by the launcher,\nboost motors and, if appropriate, its own spin. The static load test is an early structure-\nlevel qualification test. A flight representative structure is held in a very rigid test stand\nrepresenting the launch vehicle adapter and subjected to limit, yield and ultimate loads\nthrough hydraulic jacks. Structural strains and displacements are measured. A Spin Test\n(Q) is required if loads of 2g or more are predicted in a spinning spacecraft.\n\nSinusoidal Vibration tests (Q , A) primarily validate mechanical modelling and ver-\nify that the spacecraft can withstand the physical vibration environment induced during\nlaunch. A vibrator, or \u2018shaker\u2019, subjects the spacecraft to a \u2018sweep\u2019 of sinusoidal frequen-\ncies rising from 4 to 100 Hz or 150 Hz at prescribed levels and a sweep rate specified by\nthe launch vehicle manual, times a factor of 1.25 for qualification. The qualification test\nrun compares the response (natural frequencies and mode shapes) to the sine input, and\nis used to assess the accuracy of the mass and stiffness model.\n\nIf run on the flight model, then the sine test can compare responses of the flight hardware\nto qualification results. Different natural frequencies or responses may indicate problems\nwith materials or workmanship.\n\nModal Survey testing (Q) determines by experimental methods the natural frequencies,\nmode shapes and damping factors of the spacecraft. The modal survey is investigative in\nnature, and to some extent a trial and error approach is adopted. There are not necessarily\npass/fail criteria, except when it is an objective to avoid certain natural frequencies. It\nis useful when similar sine vibration-induced natural modes combine into single modes,\nand the isolation of modelling errors becomes impossible.\n\nThe spacecraft structure is attached to an isolated seismic block. The natural modes\nare excited by single or multipoint actuators with transient, random or sinusoidal\ncharacteristics.\n\nRandom Vibration and Acoustic Noise tests (Q , A). The acoustic noise environment is\ngreatest at lift-off when noise is reflected from the launch pad, and this can be of particular\n\n\n\n558 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nFigure 17.5 The Herschel spacecraft on the Estec DUAL Multishaker for a vibration\ntest. Note the protective canopy to prevent contamination from above. (Photo: ESA,\nAnneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\nconcern for large area, lightweight structures. The structural response to acoustic noise is\npredicted in terms of a random vibration. Random vibration tests using a vibrator/shaker\nare usually performed only on small spacecraft. Acoustic noise tests are performed on\nlarge spacecraft, in a reverberant chamber, to demonstrate the space vehicle can withstand\nthe acoustically-induced vibration environment during launch. However, random vibration\ntests during qualification at lower, equipment levels eliminate problems at spacecraft level.\n\nRandom vibration testing is performed on a shaker (see Figure 17.5 for a typical set-\nup). The vibration input is applied simultaneously across a spectrum of 20\u20132000 Hz for\n2 min (Q) or 1 min (A).\n\nThe acoustic test is performed with the spacecraft in launch configuration on an adaptor\nmechanically decoupled from the chamber floor so that chamber vibrations are not trans-\nmitted into the spacecraft. Figure 17.6 shows the configuration of the SMOS spacecraft\nin the Estec acoustic facility. Typically a spectrum from 30 to 8000 Hz is applied for\n2 min (Q) or 1 min (A). Where flight spacecraft equipment will operate during launch, its\nperformance should be demonstrated during the random vibration or acoustic test.\n\nShock test (Q)\u2014the spacecraft is subjected to inputs representative of the shocks\ninduced into structures as a result of (a) shroud jettison and spacecraft separation from\nthe launch vehicle, and (b) release, by pyrotechnic mechanisms, of appendages such as\nsolar panels and antennas, and their subsequent latching into operational orientation.\n\nPressure test (Q, A). This subjects pressurized subsystems to 150% of the maximum\ndesign pressure for at least 5 min, and the test is cycled three times. Any system designed\nto contain fluids will undergo a Leakage Test (Q , A), being pressurized at maximum design\npressure for 20 min. During that time the leak rate is determined and all joints and fittings\nindividually checked for leaks.\n\n\n\nTEST TYPES 17.7 559\n\nFigure 17.6 The SMOS (Soil Moisture & Ocean Salinity) payload in the Large\nEuropean Acoustic Facility (LEAF) at Estec. The MIRAS Instrument antenna \u2018wings\u2019 are\nstowed in launch configuration. The test item is mounted on a stable, isolated stand.\nThe acoustic horns can be seen in the chamber wall. (Photo: ESA, Anneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\nPhysical properties test (Q, A)\u2014the mass, centre of gravity location and moments of\ninertia of the spacecraft are determined. These results are needed by the launch vehi-\ncle/ascent analysis, as inputs to the attitude control design and also for finalizing the test\nset-up and analysing the results of other mechanical tests.\n\nThermal vacuum/vacuum temperature cycling tests (Q, A). This is a performance test that\ncharacterizes and verifies electrical functionality in the vacuum of space under specified\nthermal conditions. The test is performed at upper and lower temperature extremes and\nduring transients. The temperature profile is cycled between temperatures determined by\nthe qualification or acceptance test limits. For qualification, the temperature is cycled\nbetween hot and cold extremes four times with the first two cycles and the last cycle\ndwelling twelve hours at each extreme. The third cycle \u2018soaks\u2019 the spacecraft at hot and\nthen cold conditions for three days. Acceptance testing is performed with one less hot/\ncold cycle.\n\nThe spacecraft equipment is operated through all operational modes at each hot and cold\nstate and its performance measured. Care will be taken to ensure that internal equipment\ndissipations do not cause the upper test limits to be exceeded, and, at the other extreme,\nthat imposed cold environments do not subject any sensitive equipments to levels lower\nthan their cold design limits.\n\n\n\n560 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nFigure 17.7 The SMOS payload in the Large Space Simulator at Estec. The three\nMIRAS antenna \u2018wings\u2019 are deployed to in-flight configuration. The multi-segment\nsun-simulator can be seen in the background. Above the test specimen is its\nsuspension rig. (Photo: ESA, Anneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\nThermal balance test (Q). This simulates the mission thermal environment (solar radi-\nation, Earth albedo, deep space views, internal dissipations), and is usually performed in a\nsolar simulation chamber (under vacuum) with lamps simulating solar radiation. Shrouds\naround most of the chamber surfaces are filled with liquid (cold) or heated gaseous nitro-\ngen which simulate hot and/or cold views to space. SMOS can be seen in the large space\nsimulator, ready for thermal balance testing, in Figure 17.7.\n\nThe prescribed \u2018test cases\u2019 (see Section 17.4) are run for a number of mission phases\n(sunlight, eclipse, beginning or end of life, transfer orbit or on-station cases) and for\ndifferent operating modes of the spacecraft (main or redundant equipments powered,\nin various combinations, for example). Here, the objective is to verify that all parts of\nthe spacecraft are controlled within specified temperature limits by the thermal control\nsubsystem (blankets, radiators, heaters, paints and tape finishes), and to measure and\nrecord the actual temperature distributions.\n\nA note of explanation may be helpful here. The thermal balance test verifies thermal\ncontrol performance by determining temperatures during the test. It can be performed on\na thermal model spacecraft built with equipments that are sufficiently thermally represen-\ntative but not fully functional. The thermal vacuum test verifies electrical performance at\ntemperature extremes, and therefore requires fully-functional equipments. Thermal cycling\ninduces controlled thermal stresses that might detect component failures.\n\nElectromagnetic compatibility tests (Q , A). These are performed to determine whether\nthe spacecraft performance can be adversely affected by electromagnetic interference\nfrom external sources, or whether any of its internal equipment emits stray signals that\ncan affect its own performance, or interfere with external elements such as the launch\nvehicle and launch site systems (e.g. radars and other RF systems). The system is operated\n\n\n\nMODEL PHILOSOPHY 17.8 561\n\nFigure 17.8 The SMOS payload in the Maxwell EMC Chamber at Estec. Support stands\nfor the antenna subsystem are non-metallic. (Photo: ESA, Anneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\nin a chamber lined with RF absorbent material (see Figure 17.8) so that signals external\nto the test facility, and those emitted by the spacecraft, are absorbed and not reflected\nback into the spacecraft. Measured emissions from the spacecraft are compared against\nspecified maxima (based on launch site criteria). The spacecraft is then operated in its most\nsensitive modes when irradiated with levels that are representative of those encountered\nduring its life cycle.\n\nRadio frequency compatibility testing is similar to EMC testing, but with particular\nemphasis on interferences caused by or in RF uplinks and downlinks.\n\nMagnetic field measurements (Q , A)\u2014this is a specific test, which is only required if\nthe spacecraft carries magnetically-sensitive items such as a magnetometer. It measures\npermanent, stray and induced magnetic fields. The test facility provides the capability to\n\u2018zero out\u2019 the Earth\u2019s magnetic field while low level fields emanating from the spacecraft\nare measured. Then the facility generates controlled, uniform magnetic fields to measure\ninduced fields in metallic structures, and to calibrate magnetometer responses.\n\nMission and operations validation (Q , A) Tests are performed to verify the interfaces\nbetween the spacecraft and the mission ground control systems. The spacecraft, in\nits test facility, will be monitored and operated remotely by the Mission Operation\nCentre via a communications network. A simulated mission will be \u2018run\u2019 to verify the\nground-to-spacecraft interfaces, mission operations sequences and spacecraft database\nparameters. This validation test provides operators with vital experience and familiarity\nwith spacecraft behaviour.\n\n17.8 MODEL PHILOSOPHY\n\nGenerally the AIV engineer will quickly find, in following the process described above,\nthat there is simply not enough time to perform all verification activities in a serial manner.\n\n\n\n562 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nFurther, subjecting a spacecraft and its constituent parts to a long series of extensive\ntest will over-work it; it will simply be \u2018life expired\u2019 by the time testing is completed.\nThe solution, to evolve a workable programme, is to develop a model philosophy . What\nhardware do we need to achieve all the necessary activities, in a timely manner and\nat acceptable cost? Inherent in the choice of model philosophy is accepting that some\nactivities must take place in parallel to avoid an unduly long programme.\n\nWorking through the model philosophy evolves the optimum number and characteristics\nof sets of physical hardware to be manufactured. The aim is to achieve a high confidence in\nthe ability to verify the product within a practical timescale, but with a suitable weighting\nof costs and risks.\n\nWe have seen the need to first qualify the design , and then to acceptance-test the flight\nhardware. We noted earlier that for qualification we need to demonstrate that the design\nis adequate\u2014with margins . When it comes to testing, that means subjecting the hardware\nto environments more severe than the predicted in-flight case, i.e. more severe test levels\nand longer test durations. That, in turn, means that the spacecraft can be over-tested, and\nfatigue or wear will become a concern.\n\nThus, at spacecraft level, the first intuitive decision would be to manufacture, assemble\nand test at least two spacecraft. A Development Model (DM) would undergo qualification\ntests, before a Flight Model (FM) is manufactured and assembled for acceptance test\nand launch.\n\nDividing the tasks further, separate Development Models might be manufactured and\ntested for different design disciplines\u2014a Structural Model (SM), a Thermal Model (TM)\nand an Electrical Model (EM), for example. These Development Models might be fol-\nlowed by a Qualification Model (QM). Indeed, that was the philosophy in the 1960/70s.\nESA\u2019s GEOS (Geostationary Scientific Satellite, for wave and particle field measurement)\nprogramme included an SM, a TM, and an EM. There was even a separate Qualification\nModel (QM), and eventually an FM. To be fair, the analytical methods and computing\npower/speed/capacity achievable today were not available then, and test was the surest\nmethod of verification.\n\nHowever, the more hardware models employed, the higher the cost of manufacture\nand test. Generally mechanical and electrical development testing and some qualification\nactivities can be performed on different models in parallel before Flight Model testing\nbegins. The programme needs to incorporate opportunities for changes resulting from\nDevelopment Model tests to be incorporated into the Flight Model manufacturing sched-\nule. There are ways to optimize the programme and costs, as long as there is sufficient\nconfidence of finding design and manufacturing errors before it is too late. These include:\n\n\u2022 Planning to complete as much verification as possible at equipment and subsystem\nlevels. Then the spacecraft-level activities provide final verification that the lower\nlevel equipments work together to fulfil the system level requirements.\n\n\u2022 On completion of equipment level development and qualification model testing (but\nnot before) giving the go-ahead for both (a) manufacture of flight model equipments\nand (b) integration and test of the development spacecraft.\n\n\u2022 Optimization of the verification test programme on each spacecraft development\nmodel or qualification model after identifying the key objectives\u2014for example, a\nstructural test model is intended only to achieve structural qualification, not thermal\nor electrical performance.\n\n\n\nMODEL PHILOSOPHY 17.8 563\n\nA common solution now is to implement a Protoflight Model (PFM) philosophy. In\nthis the objectives\u2014at spacecraft level\u2014of qualification and acceptance, are combined\nin a single model. This will be the flight spacecraft. It will be subjected to qualification\ntest levels but only for acceptance durations\u2014i.e. in some respects the flight hardware\nis exposed to overtesting in the severity of test, but the effects are mitigated by keeping\nthe exposure time to a minimum. Importantly, this approach can be adopted only if full\nqualification, in all respects, is achieved at equipment level.\n\nSo what determines if a protoflight philosophy is possible? Consider a geostationary\ncommunications satellite. Its mission is to operate in a very well known environment.\nMuch experience has been gained of operating spacecraft there, and the operational sce-\nnarios have been well-rehearsed. In the commercial world of communications, there is a\nhigh level of reuse of the same design of equipments and of spacecraft configurations.\nBut, the communications spacecraft is likely to be modular. A \u2018bus\u2019 or service mod-\nule will be a \u2018build to print\u2019 copy of earlier builds, adequately qualified. The payload\nmodule will however be mission-specific. Payload data processing and ground-coverage\nantennas will be customized for different applications (point-to-point telephony, broadcast,\nmilitary versus commercial, and so on). Straightforward acceptance testing is not enough,\nbut a protoflight approach looks a possibility. But what else needs to be considered?\n\n\u2022 Can the payload configuration be adequately qualified at payload module or lower\nlevels?\n\n\u2022 Is the configuration qualified for launch on the particular launcher? In all probability,\na communications satellite manufacturer or operator will ensure that design and\ntest specifications encompass a range of likely launcher types so that they are not\nrestricted to one launcher and can sign up for the lowest cost launch, or can switch\nlaunchers to maintain commercial advantage. So perhaps structural qualification has\nbeen achieved elsewhere, but thermal qualification is needed for the new payload\nconfiguration.\n\n\u2022 Should there be more emphasis on other methods, such as analysis?\n\nOccasionally, a spacecraft may be launched that is fully identical to an earlier one. An\nexisting customer may need the same payload configuration at a second geostationary\nstation. In this situation, the spacecraft would need only acceptance tests, as its design\nwill have been qualified by similarity to the earlier mission.\n\nUltimately, however, a new generation of communication satellite is needed. A step\nincrease in capacity, power and lifetime requirements leads to a new structural design and\nconfiguration. Periodically, new technology will be used to keep the mass and volume\ndown and to improve performance. In either case, the contractor will have to demonstrate\nqualification, using development models and his own resources, before a commercial\ncustomer will finalize an order for a flight spacecraft of the new generation.\n\nThe same reasoning, leading to a protoflight approach, will apply to, say, a meteorol-\nogy or Earth-observation spacecraft in polar orbit. The bus might be very similar to a\npreviously qualified design, but the payload will probably be different. Conversely, a sci-\nentific spacecraft design will generally be \u2018new\u2019. Mission scientists want to explore new\nfrontiers, with an ever-increasing complexity of mission objectives and specifications. The\nhardware, especially in terms of electrical and software complexity will be demanding.\nIn this case, a protoflight solution is unlikely , and development models will be needed.\n\n\n\n564 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nIt will be understood, then, that the decisions needed to formulate a model philosophy,\nand the verification programme, are based on many considerations. It is not possible to\ngive hard and fast rules, but it is vital that the planning process encompasses the complete\nprogramme, from component level to spacecraft level, and indeed beyond, taking into\naccount requirements derived from the ground segment, the launcher authorities and the\nmission objectives themselves.\n\n17.9 BUILD STANDARDS AND APPLICATIONS\n\nWe have seen that a number of development models can be built for specific test objec-\ntives. They must be built to pre-determined standards of manufacture (build standards)\naccording to their verification and test objectives.\n\n17.9.1 Structure Model\n\nThe primary purpose of the Structure Model (or alternatively \u2018Structural Test Model\u2019) is\nto validate the modelling of the behaviour of the spacecraft structure, primarily through\na series of measurements under imposed loads.\n\nInitial tests such as static load tests and/or modal survey measurements are performed\non the \u2018bare\u2019 spacecraft structure, to test that structure and to validate modelling of the\nstructure subsystem design. The structure must be manufactured to full flight standard.\n\nThe structure will then be fitted with a complement of units and equipment, to represent\nthe flight spacecraft launch configuration - that is, at predicted launch mass with that\nmass correctly distributed throughout the structure. The simplest approach is to use mass\ndummies for each piece of equipment, which works well at \u2018black box\u2019 level. The mass\nand centre of gravity of each unit is representative of the flight item. The attachment\ninterfaces (via bolts and washers) to the structure will be flight standard design, installed\nto flight procedures.\n\nLaunch environments are imposed in acoustic noise and vibration tests to further vali-\ndate modelling of the launch configuration and to verify acceptable structural behaviour\nunder launch conditions, including the important demonstration that the spacecraft will\nsurvive the launch phase.\n\nSpacecraft level tests are particularly important to the launcher authorities. They require\nconvincing proof that the spacecraft design is qualified for their launch vehicle. The launch\nphase is of course critical\u2014break-up or high-amplitude vibration of the spacecraft will\nseverely affect the launcher trajectory, possibly leading to a catastrophic disintegration of\nthe launch vehicle and very bad publicity for the launch agency!\n\nFor structurally significant equipments such as deployable antennas and their hold-\ndown mechanisms, it is sensible to install structurally and functionally representative\nhardware, since:\n\n\u2022 Their vibrational resonances and dynamic behaviours should be present in the space-\ncraft under test, so that the results can be fed back into the modelling. This includes\nfuel \u2018slosh\u2019 under vibration. Hence consideration needs to be given to including\n\u2018fillable\u2019 fuel and pressurant tanks in propulsion systems.\n\n\n\nBUILD STANDARDS AND APPLICATIONS 17.9 565\n\n\u2022 It is an opportunity to qualify appendage designs for launch in a representative\nsituation\u2014installed on the spacecraft. It is as important to verify that hold-down\nmechanisms do not release under vibration as it is to verify that they will release\ncorrectly after the launch phase\u2014by testing them after vibration and acoustic\nnoise tests.\n\n\u2022 It is an opportunity to perform deployment tests and measurements at spacecraft\nlevel, and that includes shock testing. When an appendage is deployed (by bolt or\ncable cutters for instance) and also when it locks into its final position, a shock is\ntransmitted through the spacecraft structure. Such shocks need to be quantified and\nshown to be non-detrimental.\n\nThe Structure Model will be fitted with test instrumentation including accelerometers,\nstrain gauges and displacement sensors to provide test data.\n\n17.9.2 Thermal Model\n\nIn a similar way the Thermal Model validates the mathematical modelling of the ther-\nmal behaviour of the spacecraft by testing the thermal control subsystem in a Thermal\nBalance test.\n\nThe build specification must include a flight-standard structure (for correct thermal\nconduction), with flight standard thermal finishes (for internal and external radiation\nexchange). Flight-type thermal control hardware needs to be present but heater mats\nare sufficient to simulate the heat dissipation of electrical circuits. Units and equipments\nneed to be at least representative of their thermal capacity.\n\nThe Thermal Model will be populated with many thermocouples for the test. In them-\nselves they can affect the thermal balance situation\u2014a large bundle of cabling can provide\na noticeable conduction path that needs to be taken into account in the test case analysis.\nThe Thermal Model may also provide a convenient test vehicle for specific subsystem\nequipments that themselves actively control temperatures or are critically temperature\ndependent. Examples include cryostats, louvres and shutters.\n\nStructure and Thermal Models provide useful tools for the AIT engineers to rehearse\nand prove ground handling procedures and to verify facility interfaces.\n\n17.9.3 Life Test Models\n\nLife Testing is an important verification method - not at spacecraft level but for mecha-\nnisms and moving parts in particular. Every mechanism will have a specified \u2018life\u2019\u2014the\nnumber of operations of a switch or valve, or a number of years of continuous operation\nfor a solar array drive motor, for example.\n\nTo verify life, a flight standard model of the mechanism is placed into a representative\nenvironment (usually a small thermal vacuum chamber) as early in the programme as\npossible. It is then operated for a multiple of its specified number of flight operations or\nof its specified lifetime\u2014including margins for qualification. It is useful to add instru-\nmentation that will measure wear or changes in performance in situ, as long as it does not\ninfluence performance. Alternatively the test will be interrupted periodically to measure\nperformance and to inspect for degradation.\n\n\n\n566 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\n17.9.4 Electrical Functional Models\n\nEarly verification of the system level functionality and performance requires an Elec-\ntrical Model of some description. This can be an Engineering Model , close to flight\nrepresentative, with a flight-type structure, harness and engineering or qualification model\nequipments. Redundant units are not generally needed. Components need not be to full\nspace-qualified standard, but military specifications are usual. This Engineering Model\napproach might be used in the case of a complex and new design.\n\nIn many less demanding cases the electrical test model is put together on a \u2018table\ntop\u2019, and referred to as a Functional Test Bed , or Electrical Verification Model . This is\na simple representation of the spacecraft mounting surfaces, with harness lengths being\napproximately correct. Electrical and electronic equipments are added as soon as they can\nbe delivered from lower level testing. Software simulations can be used to stand in for\nmissing units until the complete functionality of the spacecraft is built up. This model is\nthen used to:\n\n\u2022 Verify electrical performance, integrate software and run software validation\nsequences, rehearsing integration and ground test procedures in the process.\n\n\u2022 Validate electrical test equipment and procedures, develop and automate test\nsequences and train engineering staff.\n\n\u2022 Trouble-shoot problems found with the flight spacecraft, and to check out corrective\naction. This can continue after launch to diagnose in-flight anomalies and validate\nsoftware upgrades before uplinking them to the flight spacecraft, or to rehearse\nrevised operational command sequences before performing them in-orbit.\n\n17.9.5 Flight or Protoflight Model\n\nThe Flight (or Protoflight) Model is of necessity built to full flight standard (high reliability\nparts, fully redundant units, correct finishes, and more)\u2014it is of course the hardware that\nwill be launched.\n\n17.9.6 Other models\n\nThere is often a significant advantage in introducing other \u2018models\u2019 into the AIV pro-\ngramme to narrow down design or analysis options. These include:\n\n\u2022 A simple Configuration Model representing the size and shape of a spacecraft, that\ncan help to verify facility interfaces and transport movements, and to develop han-\ndling procedures.\n\n\u2022 A more representative Configuration Model, that can be used to visualize harness\nrouting, to plan equipment locations, and to demonstrate accessibility for attachment\nbolts or test connections.\n\n\u2022 An Antenna Test Model , which is built on a simple but metallic representation of the\nspacecraft, and fitted with transmit and receive antennas, sensitive sensors and detec-\ntors. Powering the model in an open-air test range or anechoic facility will quickly\nidentify the most significant problems areas of cross modulation and interference.\n\n\n\nGROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT 17.10 567\n\nThese models are relatively cheap to build and can provide much needed confidence\nat an early stage of the programme. Where interactions are complex, early test data\nhighlights the most important areas for analysis and eliminates the non-viable options from\nfurther analysis.\n\nMODEL PHILOSOPHY: A CASE STUDY\n\nEnvisat (launched March 2002) was a totally new design of spacecraft. It was too\nlarge for transportation as a single entity. In the early stages of the project new test\nfacilities were under construction for the Ariane 5 generation of large spacecraft,\nbut existing facilities, although not large enough could not be ruled out.\n\nHence, Envisat was \u2018modular\u2019\u2014a Service Module (SM) and a Payload Mod-\nule (PLM). The PLM was a new and complex design, with a high probability of\ninterface problems. Functionality and electromagnetic compatibility needed to be\nverified early.\n\nA thermal balance development test was initially planned, needing a representa-\ntive PLM structure. Thus a fully-representative Engineering Model (EM) of the PLM\nwas needed. Then, to fully explore electrical performance, the EM PLM needed to\nbe coupled with a fully-functional Service Module.\n\nHowever, the Service Module, as a direct development of the SPOT 4 Earth\nObservation spacecraft, did not need an Engineering Model. A hybrid approach\nwas the solution for this stage of the AIT programme. A Protoflight Service Module\n(PFM SM) would support the EM test programme. i.e. the Envisat EM spacecraft\nwas (PFM SM)+(EM PLM)\n\nIt was then shown that analytical techniques were good enough to eliminate\nthe early thermal balance test. The EM Payload Module therefore used lower-cost\nmaterials of slightly below flight standard. For example, EM equipment panels were\naluminium honeycomb, in place of the carbon-skinned honeycomb flight design.\n\nThis Engineering Model configuration was not however sufficient for necessary\nstructural qualification. A Structure Model Spacecraft (StM, to distinguish it from\nSM) was needed. Hence, an StM of both the Service Module and Payload Module\nwould be built. i.e. The Envisat StM spacecraft was (StM SM)+(StM PLM)\n\nOf this development model hardware, the Protoflight Service Module would be\nmade ready for flight. It would join with new Flight Model PLM. There was however\none final change. After a cost review, it was decided to refurbish the StM PLM\nstructure and to use for the FM PLM. i.e. The Flight spacecraft was (PFM SM\nfrom EM spacecraft) + (FM PLM, with refurbished StM PLM structure)\n\n17.10 GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT\n\nThere is one more significant cost and planning element to consider. No spacecraft AIT\nprogramme can be performed without Ground Support Equipment (GSE)\u2014that is, the\nequipment needed to handle and to test the spacecraft up to launch.\n\n\n\n568 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nDesigning, procuring, testing and verifying the GSE itself is a significant part of the\nAIV process. It can be schedule critical\u2014it will be required in the AIT programme when\nthe first spacecraft components arrive, but the GSE design cannot be finalized until the\nspacecraft design is approved.\n\n17.10.1 Mechanical Ground Support Equipment (MGSE)\n\nA wide range of MGSE is needed to hold, lift, move, store and transport flight hardware,\nprotecting it from damage and degradation at all times, and ensuring safety for personnel\nworking with it or in the vicinity. MGSE is required at all levels of the programme from\nequipment level to spacecraft level. Here we discuss primarily the spacecraft level MGSE.\n\nMGSE must be compatible with the attachment interfaces on the hardware, and with\nall the test facilities to be encountered in the AIT programme. Equipment includes:\n\n\u2022 Adapters to securely attach the spacecraft to test facility interfaces or to other MGSE.\nThis will normally be at the spacecraft launch vehicle attachment surface, so that\ninterface on the MGSE must be of the same high standard as on the launcher.\n\n\u2022 Integration trolleys, stands and turnover devices (see for example Figure 17.9) that\nare used during assembly and integration, functional tests throughout the AIV phase,\nand during launch preparation. Between them, they need to provide access to all\nparts of the spacecraft by rotating the spacecraft in any attitude from horizon-\ntal to vertical. Wheels, or air skates, will allow local movement of these devices\nwithin facilities.\n\nFigure 17.9 GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer)\nspacecraft attached to its Integration and Turn-over Stand for detailed inspection of\nsolar cells. (Photo: ESA, Anneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\n\n\nGROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT 17.10 569\n\n\u2022 Lifting equipment for use with facility cranes\u2014beams, hooks and slings and project-\nspecific interfaces to the spacecraft. It is often necessary to lift a partially-assembled\nspacecraft in which the centre of gravity is off-axis. The lifting beam therefore needs\na mechanism to offset the centre of lift to compensate and to maintain the spacecraft\naxis vertical.\n\n\u2022 Transport containers\u2014to move the spacecraft (or sometimes Service and Payload\nModules separately) between facilities, ensuring that cleanliness is maintained. They\nmay be purged and pressurized at a slight over-pressure with nitrogen, in which case\nexternal temperature changes must be taken into account for safety. They will include\nfacilities for monitoring and recording the internal environment, and to record any\nadverse shocks encountered during transport. Containers can also be used to store\nthe spacecraft if necessary\u2014for example, if the launch is delayed.\nClearly, containers must be designed in conjunction with the proposed transportation\nscenario, and be compatible with any cargo aircraft (see Figure 17.12 later), road vehi-\ncle, barge or railway it is to use. Special transport scenarios might apply. International\nstandards demand a double-walled container if the spacecraft includes radioactive\nsources. Large spacecraft may have to be moved at night (see Figure 17.10).\n\n\u2022 Deployment Rigs\u2014to support deployable solar arrays, booms and antennas in a way\nthat compensates for the Earth\u2019s gravity field. They will be used both statically during\nalignment measurement and adjustment, and dynamically during deployment tests.\n\n\u2022 Special-to-test equipment, examples being a thermal test adapter that simulates the\nPayload Module mechanical and thermal interfaces during a Service module test,\nand vice versa, and vibration or acoustic noise test adapters.\n\n\u2022 Covers and protective devices and sometimes, special tools.\n\nFigure 17.10 The Herschel spacecraft container is loaded to its transporter\u2014at night\nand in the rain! (Photo: ESA, Anneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\n\n\n570 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\n17.10.2 Fluids Ground Support Equipment (FGSE)\n\nFGSE is required to service the propulsion subsystem, to load and drain simulated propel-\nlant and pressurant during the test programme, and to load (and in a contingency situation\nto drain) the flight propellant during launch preparations. FGSE also serves to pressurize\nthe propulsion system, for leak testing and for launch. Other FGSE may be required in\nparticular programmes for loading and draining cryogenic fluids.\n\n17.10.3 Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE)\n\nEGSE provides all the power supplies and uplink data to the spacecraft for ground testing,\nand receives and analyses all downlink data.\n\nTypical EGSE for spacecraft testing provides services and functions to:\n\n\u2022 Power the spacecraft, simulating solar arrays and batteries.\n\u2022 Deliver (uplink) commands and ranging signals, and receive (downlink) telemetry.\n\u2022 Receive, demodulate, decode and distribute housekeeping data via hardline or radio-\n\nfrequency links. Automatically check all data against high and low specification\nlimits, and look for unexpected states (e.g. those not in accordance with the expected\nresult of an uplinked mode-change command).\n\n\u2022 Display status parameters for an immediate overview of test and spacecraft status.\nRecord, archive and playback all test activities and results.\n\n\u2022 Distribute data, routinely and on-demand, to remote workstations for monitoring by\npayload and subsystem specialists. Check validity of and respond to commands from\nremote workstations for stimuli and mode changes by uplink to the spacecraft.\n\n\u2022 Provide stimuli signals to attitude sensors; receive downlink data and measure\nresponses at the interfaces to attitude and orbit control actuators (thrusters, reaction\nwheels); provide closed-loop simulation and processing of Attitude and Orbit\nControl subsystem performance.\n\nAll of these functions run under the control of central processors and are performed\nthrough validated, repeatable, consistent automatic test sequences.\n\n17.10.4 GSE logistics\n\nHow much Ground Support Equipment is needed? The number of each item is determined\nby the AIT programme schedule and model philosophy. Where a development model is\ntested in parallel with the assembly of a flight model, two sets of much of the MGSE will\nbe needed. However, a significant cost saving can be made if one transport container can\nbe shared between models. Similarly, two sets of EGSE will be required if an electrical\nmodel is to be tested in parallel with a flight model.\n\nGenerally for a commercial, communications satellite programme the contractor will\nbe expected to provide all GSE required to fulfil the programme\u2019s needs. A scientific\nspacecraft programme will require project-specific GSE designs, in accordance with the\nneeds of the development programme and GSE will be a project cost. There is one general\nexception to the latter statement. FGSE for propulsion systems is now generally provided\n\n\n\nCHECKPOINTS IN THE AIV PROGRAMME 17.11 571\n\nFigure 17.11 Marshalling equipment for shipment. (Photo: ESA, Anneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\nby specialist contractors who undertake propulsion-related tasks and provide their own\nequipment as part of their contract.\n\nFor every movement of the spacecraft many boxes, large and small, are needed to\nprotect the test equipment, spare parts, tools and documents travelling with it between\ntest facilities or to the launch site (see Figure 17.11).\n\n17.10.5 GSE verification\n\nIt remains to add that every item of GSE, large or small, must be properly tested and\nverified before it is used with spacecraft hardware. Lifting and handling equipment will\nbe proof-load tested. Interfaces will be carefully measured and tested to prevent damage\nto flight hardware interfaces. Indeed, verification of GSE follows essentially the same\nprocesses as for flight hardware.\n\n17.11 CHECKPOINTS IN THE AIV PROGRAMME\n\nThe spacecraft project will include a number of formal reviews in which the customer will\nassess progress in design\u2014and in the AIV planning. The AIV Programme will therefore,\ntypically, interact with the formal reviews as follows:\n\n\u2022 Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Is the system level design ready for the lower\nlevel design process to begin? The PDR also looks at the initial Verification Planning.\n\n\u2022 Critical Design Review (CDR). Is the design ready for manufacture or assembly?\nThe review will give the go-ahead for manufacture of engineering and qualification\nmodel hardware. Are the Verification Plan, the model philosophy and the verification\nmatrix complete? Are the test plans and procedures ready? Are GSE designs ready?\n\n\n\n572 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\n\u2022 Qualification Review (QR). Are the qualification tasks complete, the test results sat-\nisfactory and the analyses validated? If a protoflight philosophy has been adopted,\nwhat qualification tasks are, by agreement, deferred to the protoflight model space-\ncraft, and are the plans and procedures ready? In this case, a \u2018Delta-Qualification\u2019\nreview might be held or open items closed-out in the later Flight Acceptance Review.\n\n\u2022 Flight Acceptance Review (FAR). Has the (proto) flight spacecraft passed all its tests,\nand are flight prediction analyses completed? Is the spacecraft ready for shipment to\nlaunch site?\n\n\u2022 Flight Readiness Review (FRR). Have the final activities and tests been completed?\nThe FRR includes not only the spacecraft, but the launch vehicle and ground segment.\n\n17.12 VERIFICATION CLOSEOUT\n\nWe now return to the verification process. Throughout the AIT programme many test\nreports, analysis reports, inspection records and review-of-design reports will have been\ngenerated and reviewed. Anomalies and discrepancies will have been subject to investi-\ngation and perhaps retest, always controlled by Product Assurance (PA) procedures. It is\nthe task of the verification engineer, in conjunction with PA, to perform the \u2018verification\ncloseout\u2019 process.\n\nIf a specification item is verified by a single method (test or analysis, say), the associated\nreport is sufficient to close out that requirement\u2014it has been verified. If two or more\nmethods are involved (test and analysis perhaps), then an additional verification report\nis needed to confirm closeout. If all is well, the verification matrix line item is closed.\nIf not, the process repeats, perhaps after hardware or software modifications, with more\ntesting, or more analysis.\n\nSome items in the matrix will be held open until launch site preparations are complete,\nbut by the FRR every item in the verification matrix will be closed out.\n\n17.13 LAUNCH PREPARATION\n\nFigure 17.12 shows the Herschel spacecraft in the process of shipment to the launch site. In\nan ideal case, the spacecraft will be delivered to the launch site \u2018ready to go\u2019. However,\nin practice, there are a number of tasks still to be performed. Flight pyrotechnics and\nother hazardous devices will not normally be fitted during transportation. The propulsion\nsystem will not be fuelled and pressurized until the last practical opportunity (and the\nfilling and pressurizing process includes final checks for leakage). Similarly, batteries will\nbe conditioned and charged to flight state only shortly before launch.\n\nAn Integrated System Check and a full inspection survey will be performed to verify no\ndamage or performance degradation during transportation. All alignments will be checked.\nMass properties will be remeasured, in the final case for the fuelled spacecraft, which is\ntherefore performed in the launch site\u2019s Hazardous Processing Facility.\n\nParticular care is needed to maintain or restore the \u2018Flight Acceptance\u2019 status of the\nspacecraft where parts are disassembled to facilitate launch site operations\u2014for example,\nremoval of batteries for charging, removal of thermal blankets or close-out panels for\naccess to test connectors or pyrotechnic installation. The spacecraft must be returned to\nflight readiness by very strict adherence to flight quality processes and procedures.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION 17.14 573\n\nFigure 17.12 Shipment to the launch site: Herschel, in its container, is loaded into an\nAntonov transport aircraft. Note container air conditioners, and the bank of gas bottles\nfor purging the interior. (Photo: ESA, Anneke Le Floc\u2019h)\n\nDuring these final days on the ground, the schedule is coordinated with the preparation\nof the launch vehicle, and the spacecraft will eventually make the journey to be attached\nto its launcher. The sequence of events depends to some degree on which launcher is\nchosen. At this time the FRR will assess the readiness of the complete system for launch.\nIt is a mission readiness review for the spacecraft, launcher and ground segment. Only\na few tasks will remain to be performed, one of which (for the spacecraft) is the \u2018last\nminute\u2019 removal of red tag items and the fitting of green tag items.\n\nRed Tag items . Throughout AIT a number of protective devices will have been attached\nto flight hardware. They include protective covers (for optical surfaces, protruding items,\netc.) and safety devices (pins or plugs that prevent inadvertent operation of pyrotechnics,\nrelease mechanisms, etc.). These must be removed before flight\u2014at the last moment they\nare accessible. That may be before or during fairing installation, or through a hatch in\nthe fairing at a later time. Rather obviously, they are coloured red and should have the\nwords \u2018Remove Before Flight\u2019 written on them!\n\nGreen Tag items are the opposite, and must be installed for flight\u2014they are devices,\nusually \u2018arm plugs\u2019, that make final connections between hazardous items, such as\npyrotechnics, motors and thrusters and their power sources.\n\n17.14 CONCLUSION\n\nThe AIV/AIT process is an important part of any spacecraft programme. Just as a\nspacecraft design evolves to optimize mass, power needs, costs, reliability and more,\nso AIV/AIT planning optimizes the schedule and cost of the task of verifying that the\nend product, the flight spacecraft, will achieve its mission objectives.\n\n\n\n574 ASSEMBLY, INTEGRATION AND VERIFICATION\n\nEqually, just as there is no single design that will meet the needs of several missions,\nthere is no standard AIV/AIT programme. This chapter has discussed many considerations\nand concepts that will be proposed, discussed and eventually included in the verification\nprogramme. The aim is always to deliver a fully compliant spacecraft to orbit, where it\nwill perform a successful mission.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] ECSS-E-ST-10-02C Spacecraft Engineering, Verification Engineering . www.ecss.nl (accessed\n18 October 2010).\n\n[2] ECSS-E-10-03A Space Engineering, Testing . www.ecss.nl (accessed 18 October 2010).\n\n\n\n18\nSMALL SATELLITE\nENGINEERING\nAND APPLICATIONS\n\nMartin N. Sweeting and Craig I. Underwood\n\nSurrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey\n\n18.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nEarly western satellites were necessarily small. However, the need for ever-larger, more\ncapable and more complex satellites led to a natural growth in satellite mass. This trend\nwas first limited by the capabilities of available launchers and then later by finance and\ntechnological infrastructure, as space-faring nations required a highly developed techno-\nlogical base with huge investment. This resulted in space becoming limited to a few\nnations\u2014an exclusive club of space \u2018haves\u2019 with enormous military, economic and cul-\ntural advantages over the space \u2018have-nots\u2019.\n\nChanging world politics and military emphasis in the last twenty years has brought about\na quiet revolution in space. Pressure on both civil and military space agency budgets has\nmeant increasingly that fewer (and bigger) satellites have been commissioned and new\nideas, technologies and scientific experiments have found it difficult to gain timely access\nto space.\n\nIn the 1970s, advances in Very-Large Scale Integration (VLSI) led to the possibility of\nsophisticated functions being built into very small volumes, with low mass and requiring\nminimal electrical power. This led to the emergence of the modern small satellite\u2014or\nmicrosatellite \u2014which, in turn, led to the potential for a dramatic cost-reduction in satellite\nprogrammes. This was initially demonstrated by the pioneering Orbiting Satellite Carrying\nAmateur Radio (OSCAR) and Radio-Sputnik (RS) series of satellites produced by the\ninternational amateur radio satellite (AMSAT) community and their Russian counter-parts.\n\nStarting in 1961 with OSCAR-1\u2014a simple radio transmitter in a box\u2014these \u2018amateur\u2019\nmicrosatellites, built by enthusiasts in the USA, USSR, Germany, Australia and Japan,\ngrew in sophistication, until by the end of the 1970s, with OSCAR-8, they had reached a\nsignificant level of sophistication in terms of supporting amateur radio communications [1]\nbut still without an onboard computing capability.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W. Stark.\n\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n576 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nIt was at this time that staff and students (all amateur radio enthusiasts) at the University\nof Surrey embarked on a programme to develop a microsatellite for the UK\u2014which\nresulted in the design, and construction of UoSAT-1 (UoSAT-OSCAR-9), launched by\nNASA in October 1981 [2].\n\nThe 1980s thus ushered in a new era of small sophisticated satellites, characterized\nby extensive use of microprocessors and other VLSI technologies. Indeed the success\nof UoSAT-1 lead directly to a second spacecraft (UoSAT-2\u2014UoSAT-OSCAR-11), being\ndesigned and built in the record time of just 6 months for launch in March 1984 [3].\n\nUoSAT-1 continued to operate successfully for eight years until its re-entry in 1989.\nUoSAT-2 remained operational for twenty years\u2014despite its three year mission design\nlife! These two spacecraft established the modern concept of a microsatellite, and Surrey\nhas since become a world leader in providing small-satellite platforms and the associated\ntechnological \u2018know-how\u2019 to both existing and emerging space nations through its spin-off\ncompany\u2014Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL).\n\nIn many ways the relationship between a \u2018microsatellite\u2019 and a \u2018conventional\u2019 satellite\nis similar to that between a microcomputer (i.e. a personal computer or PC) and a conven-\ntional computer. That is, a microsatellite is sufficiently low in cost and yet has sufficient\nutility to enable it to serve a much wider user community than would otherwise be the case.\n\nThe mass market for PCs is sustained and exists (in-part), due to the astonishing rate\nof progress of microelectronic technologies over the last 30 years. The staggering devel-\nopments in microelectronics, stimulated increasingly by the consumer market rather than\nmilitary requirements, and the dramatic pace of consumer product development, have\ncaused conventional space technology often to lag considerably behind that taken for\ngranted on the ground. However, these advances have had a direct impact on the power\nand sophistication of microsatellites through their adoption of commercial-off-the-shelf\n(COTS) microelectronic technologies developed for terrestrial use and adapted to the space\nenvironment. The combination of reducing budgets for space and increasing capability of\nlow-power microelectronics have enabled a new breed of highly capable smaller, faster,\ncheaper satellites to realize many space missions\u2014complementing the conventional large\nsatellite systems still necessary for large-scale space science and communications services\nto small terminals.\n\nLike their PC counter-parts, microsatellites are generally small and relatively\ninexpensive\u2014typically 1/10th or 1/100th the mass and cost of conventional satellites.\nThis has led to the following widely accepted definitions, given in Table 18.1, and shown\nschematically in Figure 18.1.\n\nTable 18.1 Classification of spacecraft by mass and\ncost\n\nClass Mass (kg) Cost (\u00a3M)\n\nConventional large satellite >1000 >100\nConventional small satellite 500\u20131000 25\u2013100\nMinisatellite 100\u2013500 7\u201325\nMicrosatellite 10\u2013100 1\u20137\nNanosatellite 1\u201310 0.1\u20131\nPicosatellite <1 <0.1\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 18.1 577\n\n1 kg\n\n10 kg\n\n100 kg\n\n1000 kg\n\nGEO-mini-\nsat\n\nMinisat\n\nEnhanced\nmicrosat\n\nMicrosat\n\nNanosat\n\nN\nanosat\n\nM\nicrosat\n\nM\ninisat\n\nFigure 18.1 Schematic of small satellite classification (Reproduced by permission of\nSSTL)\n\nAlthough microsatellites are physically small, they are nevertheless complex and exhibit\nvirtually all the characteristics of a large satellite\u2014but in a microcosm.\n\nIn addition to fulfilling communications, remote sensing and space science applications,\nthese miniature satellites are particularly suitable as a focus for the education and training\nof young scientists and engineers by providing a means for direct, hands-on experience\nof all stages and aspects (both technical and managerial) of a real satellite mission\u2014from\ndesign, construction, test and launch through to orbital operation.\n\nThis educational aspect has been given a considerable boost by the CubeSat con-\ncept, as shown in Figure 18.2\u2014a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 cm, 1 kg satellite (referred to as a\n1U unit)\u2014first proposed in 1998 by Professor Robert Twiggs at Stanford University\u2019s\nSpace Systems Development Laboratory [4]. These satellites, and their slightly larger\nderivatives (so-called 2U and 3U units), have revolutionized practical \u2018hands-on\u2019 space\n\n\n\n578 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nFigure 18.2 Professor Bob Twiggs with CubeSat (Reproduced by permission of Robert\nTwiggs)\n\neducation and world wide over 70 such projects have been completed or are under\ndevelopment\u2014principally by Universities [4].\n\nOf course, such small satellites cannot cater for all mission objectives\u2014especially\nwhere large transmitter powers, antenna arrays, or optical apertures are required for appli-\ncations such as direct broadcast TV and mobile voice communications from geostationary\norbit, or for very high resolution Earth or astronomical imaging. Nevertheless, as on-board\nprocessing capabilities have advanced, many missions, hitherto only feasible with large\nsatellites, have become possible with microsatellites at a fraction of the conventional\nmission cost. In particular, microsatellites make affordable constellations possible (see\nSection 5.5) and can thus, for example, provide rapid revisit and high temporal resolution\nfor Earth observation missions at a realistic cost. The advent of CubeSat and similarly\nsized spacecraft opens up the possibility of designing missions using \u2018swarms\u2019 of tiny\nsatellites to form robust networks that can synthesize apertures.\n\n\n\nSMALL SATELLITE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 18.2 579\n\nSmall, low cost satellites alone do not result in low cost missions, and each element of\nthe qualitative equation below needs to be appropriately apportioned, with typical values\ngiven below:\n\nTotal Mission cost = satellite cost + launch cost + orbital operations costs over lifetime\n\n100% 70% 20% 10%\n\nSimilarly, a small satellite is not necessarily a low cost satellite. Low cost is achieved\nthrough the application of a certain design philosophy to the entire mission. Indeed, for\nmany, it is not the size of the spacecraft as such, but the application of this design\nphilosophy, which distinguishes \u2018small\u2019 satellites from conventional ones.\n\n18.2 SMALL SATELLITE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY\n\nModern small satellites are built in rapid time-scales (typically 12\u201318 months), at rela-\ntively low-cost, and make maximum use of state-of-the-art COTS technologies to achieve\ncomplex functionality, whilst at the same time minimizing dependence on complex mech-\nanisms, deployable structures, and so on.\n\nThe satellites are engineered to cost specifically to meet their mission objectives during\ntheir design lifetime\u2014and no more. The mission objectives are carefully traded against\ncost to achieve the minimum necessary to achieve the required outcome\u2014typically aiming\nto achieve 80% of the (conventional) mission capability at 20% of the (conventional)\nmission cost. Careful management of risk allows more spacecraft missions to be afforded\nmore regularly. The consequences of this design philosophy are contrasted with those of\na conventional mission in Figure 18.3.\n\nThe rapid development of modern electronic devices means that small satellites often\nuse state-of-the-art technologies with little or no flight heritage. This poses an immediate\nproblem\u2014how do you know if these technologies will work in space if they have never\nflown before? This is especially true of COTS technologies, which, by their nature, are\nunlikely to have been designed to operate in the relatively harsh environment of space.\n\nIn conventional space missions, there is usually sufficient time and resources to\nundertake a thorough programme of ground-based testing prior to flight (see Chapter 17),\nbut this is problematical if cost-reduction and short design-to-orbit times are major\nmission drivers\u2014as they usually are in small-satellite programmes. Thus, a different\napproach is needed.\n\nIncreased\nCost\n\nReduc\nsk\n\nFewe\nMiss io\n\nIncreased \ncost\n\nReduced \nrisk\n\nConventional\nMission\n\nSmall\nSatellite\nMission\n\nFewer \nmissions\n\nReduced \nCost\n\nMor\n\nReduced \nCost\nReduced \ncost\n\nManaged \nrisk\n\nMorMore \nmissions\n\nFigure 18.3 Consequences of conventional mission versus small satellite mission\ndesign philosophy (Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\n\n\n580 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nThe general approach to minimizing the risks associated with the use of COTS technolo-\ngies is to rely more on sound design practices , experience and system-level testing , rather\nthan on (expensive) programmes of testing individual devices. However, this requires\nthe design-engineers to have a good knowledge of the (space) environment to which\ntheir systems will be exposed\u2014and to use appropriate design techniques and margins as\nnecessary. Some of the measures employed may be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Minimize the variety of devices/materials.\n\u2022 Avoid toxic, volatile or potentially explosive substances.\n\u2022 Keep the interfaces simple.\n\u2022 Minimize moving parts\u2014use of body cells, use of passive thermal control.\n\u2022 Use previously-flown designs and components in essential systems.\n\u2022 Be realistic with safety margins.\n\u2022 Ensure systems are capable of independent operation\u2014avoid chains.\n\u2022 Use carefully selected high volume components where possible.\n\u2022 Avoid software in the loop.\n\u2022 Knowledgeable use of volume-production, and modern components.\n\u2022 Use of a layered, failure-resilient system architecture.\n\u2022 Ensure a thorough burn-in prior to flight.\nSolving the technical challenges associated with the design, construction, test and opera-\n\ntion of a microsatellite is only half of the story. In parallel with the technical considerations\nof the mission, effective project management is crucial to the realization of a successful\nlow-cost, sophisticated small satellite project.\n\nAffordable small satellites require a very different approach to management as well as\nto technology if cost, performance and delivery targets are to be met. Several attempts\nby traditional aerospace organizations to produce such satellites have failed because of\nthe rigidity of management structure and \u2018mind-set\u2019. Small teams (typically 25 persons),\nworking in close proximity with good communications, and well-informed and responsive\nmanagement, are essential.\n\nThese characteristics are best found in small companies or research teams rather than\nlarge aerospace organizations, who may find it difficult to adopt or modify procedures\nnecessary to produce affordable small satellites using staff and structures that are designed\nfor conventional aerospace projects. The main ingredients for a successful small satellite\nproject can be summarized as:\n\n\u2022 Highly innovative technical staff.\n\u2022 Small, motivated teams.\n\u2022 Personal responsibility for work rigour and quality.\n\u2022 Good team communications, and close physical proximity.\n\u2022 Well-defined mission objectives and constraints.\n\u2022 Technically-competent project management.\n\u2022 Short timescale (which prevents escalation of objectives).\n\n18.3 SMALL SATELLITE SYSTEM DESIGN\n\nThe spacecraft should be designed such that, where possible, essential platform sub-\nsystems are fully redundant. However, this does not mean simply duplicating systems,\n\n\n\nSMALL SATELLITE SYSTEM DESIGN 18.3 581\n\nbut rather to build a layered architecture in which each successive layer of redundancy\nrelies on different systems comprising increasingly well-proven technologies. The upper-\nlayer systems use state-of-the-art high-performance device types\u2014often without flight\nheritage \u2014which give a very high degree of functionality. The lower-layer systems, on\nthe other hand, use device-types which have been flown and tested in previous spacecraft,\nand which are able to carry out most of the same functions\u2014albeit with a possible loss\nof performance. In this way, problems caused by an inherent system design fault, or by\nthe systematic failure of a particular device-type, will not be duplicated in the redundant\nlayers. If the newer devices prove successful, they become effectively flight-qualified\nfor use in future spacecraft, allowing the capabilities of the satellites to be enhanced\ngeneration-by-generation in an evolutionary approach. Table 18.2 shows an example of\nthis type of evolution with respect to the main on-board processors used on some of\nSurrey\u2019s \u2018UoSAT\u2019 microsatellites.\n\nIt is the on-board data handling (OBDH) system (see also Chapter 13) that is the key to\nthe sophisticated capability of the microsatellite. For example, at the heart of the OBDH\nsystem of a current generation UoSAT microsatellite is a 80C386 on-board computer\n(OBC), which runs a real-time multi-tasking operating system performing various tasks\nranging from payload operations, basic housekeeping functions, to sophisticated attitude\ncontrol and orbit maintenance. There is also (usually) a secondary on-board computer to\nshare computing-intensive tasks and to act as a complete back-up if necessary. In addition,\nall major sub-systems and payloads have their own in-built microcontrollers which pro-\nvide local intelligence, low-level data processing, and which also support telemetry and\ntelecommand (TTC) functions. In this way, the architecture of the microsatellite OBDH\nsystem provides similar functionality to that of a modern conventional spacecraft using,\n\nTable 18.2 Small satellite computer processors\n\nMicrosatellite Main On-Board Computer Processors\n(subsystem microcontrollers and payload processors not included)\n\n1802 Z80 80C186 80386EX\n\nUoSAT-2\n(1984)\n\nPrimary\n\nUoSAT-3\n(1990)\n\nPrimary\n(back-up)\n\nSecondary\n(experimental)\n\nPrimary\n(experimental)\n\nUoSAT-5\n(1991)\n\nSecondary Primary\n\nKITSAT-1 &\nS80/T (1992)\n\nSecondary Primary\n\nPoSAT-1 &\nHealthSat-2\n(1993)\n\nPrimary\n\nCerise (1995) Primary\nFASat-Bravo &\n\nThai Phutt\n(1998)\n\nSecondary Primary\n(experimental)\n\nSubsequent\nMissions\n(1999\u20132009)\n\nPrimary\n\n\n\n582 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nfor example, the ESA standard OBDH bus\u2014albeit using COTS data bus standards [in this\ncase the controller area network (CAN) bus] with bespoke \u2018cut-down\u2019 software interfaces\nwhich avoid the large overheads associated with the Consultative Committee for Space\nData Standards (CCSDS) TTC formats. However, unlike typical practice with conven-\ntional spacecraft, a primary feature of the microsatellite OBDH philosophy is that all the\nprimary software on-board the microsatellite is loaded after launch and can be upgraded\nand reloaded at will by the control ground station thereafter.\n\nNormally, the satellite is operated via the primary computer and the real-time multi-\ntasking operating system. All telecommand instructions are formulated into a \u2018diary\u2019 at the\nground station and then transferred to the satellite OBC for execution either immediately\nor, more usually, at some future time. The OBC can also issue its own telecommands\nautonomously in response to sensor inputs. Telemetry from on-board platform systems\nand payloads is gathered and monitored by the OBC and is transmitted to the ground\nimmediately and/or is stored in on-board memory whilst the satellite is out of range of\nthe control station. The OBCs also operate the attitude control systems according to control\nalgorithms that take input from the various attitude sensors and then act accordingly. Thus\nit is this OBDH environment that allows such a tiny microsatellite to operate in a highly\ncomplex, flexible and sophisticated manner, enabling fully automatic and autonomous\ncontrol of the satellites systems and payloads.\n\nSurrounding the OBDH system are attitude determination and control systems,\npower generation and conditioning systems, communications systems, as illustrated in\nFigure 18.4\u2014all of which support the mission payloads housed in a mechanical structure.\n\nT805\ntransputers\n\nPayload \ncontrol\n\n 386 OBC\n\nMultiplexers Modulators Transmitters\n\nTelemetry Telecommand\n\nPrimary Tx\n\nBattery \ncharge \n\nregulator\n\n6 Ah NiCd \nbattery\n\nPower \nconditioning \n\nmodule\n\nPower \ndistribution \n\nmodule\n\nTo modules\n\nSolar panels\n\nVHF ant UHF ant 1\n\nMultiplexers\n\n128 MB RAMDISK\n\n128 MB RAMDISK\n\n16 MB RAMDISK\n\nHousekeeping\n386 OBC\n\nSecondary \n Tx\n\nPayload power \nswitches & \nregulators\n\nTo payoads\n\nCAN to payloads\n\n76.8 \nkbps\n\n38.4 \nkbps\n\n9.6 \nkbps\n\n9.6 \nkbps\n\n38.4 \nkbps\n\nComms \nRx1\n\nComms \nRx2\n\n9.6kbit /sec \ndemodulator\n\n9.6kbit /sec \ndemodulator\n\n9.6kbit /sec \ndemodulator\n\nCommand \nRx 76.8 \n\nkbps\n\nFigure 18.4 Block diagram of typical UoSAT microsatellite system architecture\n(Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\n\n\nCOTS COMPONENTS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT 18.4 583\n\n18.4 COTS COMPONENTS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe space environment (see also Chapter 2) can be particularly harmful to COTS devices.\nOnce in orbit, the devices will experience high-vacuum conditions, potentially extreme\nhot or cold temperature conditions, and relatively high levels of ionizing radiation.\n\n18.4.1 Vacuum effects\n\nMany COTS parts contain plastic materials, which may out-gas under vacuum (see Section\n2.4.1). These either cannot be flown, or require further encapsulation before they can\ndo so. The plastics used to encapsulate integrated circuits are generally stable under\nvacuum, and to date, no problems due to use of plastic encapsulated parts have been\nencountered\u2014despite common usage. However, prior to flight, care must be taken to store\nthese parts under controlled temperature and humidity conditions in order, in particular,\nto prevent the ingress of water.\n\nPlastic encapsulation is thought to increase the risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD)\ndamage (see also Section 16.4.1)\u2014particularly in high orbits such as the geostationary\nEarth orbit (GEO). However, this effect is insignificant in small spacecraft in low-Earth\norbit (LEO).\n\n18.4.2 Thermal control issues\n\nMany COTS parts are only rated to operate at a temperature of between 0 and 70?C.\nThus, particular care must be taken with the spacecraft\u2019s thermal design. Virtually all\nmicrosatellites make use of passive thermal control techniques (see also Chapter 11)\nto maintain interior temperatures at moderate levels (10\u201330?C), with interior temper-\nature variations kept to a few degrees Celsius per orbit in order to reduce thermal\nstress. Where available, COTS parts with extended temperature ranges, e.g. industrial\nspec (?20\u2013+85?C) or Mil-spec (?55\u2013+125?C) are preferred. Exterior systems neces-\nsarily experience greater thermal cycling during an orbit, with variations of the order of\n50\u2013100?C not being unusual.\n\nPrior to flight, extensive thermal-cycle burn-in testing is carried out at module level,\nand mandatory thermal-vacuum testing is performed on the spacecraft as a whole in order\nto screen the COTS parts for reliability under simulated space conditions.\n\n18.4.3 Effects of ionizing radiation\n\nCOTS devices may be particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of the ionizing\nradiation environment encountered in space [5]. Thus, particular attention must be paid\nto the design of COTS-based systems in order to cope with the resultant total dose effects\n(TDEs) and single event effects (SEEs) (see also Sections 2.3.2 and 13.7). The trapped\nradiation belts (Van Allen belts) are a very serious threat to satellites, both in terms of\nradiation dose, and SEEs. There is a single proton belt, comprising high-energy protons,\nwhich affects LEO satellites in a region known as the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)\n(see Figure 18.5). The electron belts are divided into two, the inner electron belt being\n\n\n\n584 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\n90\n\n45\n\n0\n\n45\n\n?90\n?180 ?90 0 90 180\n\nLongitude\n\nFigure 18.5 South Atlantic Anomaly proton flux at 1330 km altitude measured by\nKITSAT-1 cosmic-ray experiment (Reproduced by permission of University of Surrey)\n\nmore-or-less coincident with the proton belt, and the outer electron belt being at very\nhigh altitude. LEO satellites pass through the inner belt electrons in the SAA, and high-\ninclination LEO satellites will also pass through the outer belt electrons near the poles.\nGEO satellites orbit within the outer-belt, and elliptical orbits such as Geostationary\nTransfer Orbit (GTO), and to some extent, Molniya orbits, cross both inner and outer\nbelts. Whilst trapped electrons are not a problem as far as SEEs are concerned, they are\n(potentially) a major source of radiation dose.\n\nIn addition to the trapped particles, there are also galactic cosmic-rays (GCRs) orig-\ninating in deep space. These comprise protons and heavy-ions with very high energies\n(typically a few GeV). Satellites in high-Earth orbits are essentially totally exposed to\nGCRs, but satellites in LEO receive some shielding effect from the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield\u2014except at high latitudes. There is also a shielding effect from the solid Earth and\nits atmosphere. In any case, the flux of GCRs is relatively low, and so they do not con-\nstitute a serious source of radiation dose. However, the small heavy-ion content is very\neffective at causing SEEs.\n\nSolar-flare particles are similar to GCRs, comprising mainly protons with a few percent\nheavy ions. Their energies tend to be slightly lower than GCRs. The occurrence of flares\nis correlated with the 11 year solar (Sun-spot) cycle. Major flares occur around the time\nof solar maximum , and can produce very intense particle fluxes at Earth for a day or\nso, posing a very serious threat to satellites. GEO and other high-altitude satellites are\nparticularly at risk, and one major flare may give the equivalent of a year\u2019s radiation\ndose. Polar, and other high-inclination LEO satellites, will also encounter these particles\nat high latitudes. As with GCRs, solar flare particles are an effective source of SEEs.\n\nTotal dose effects are produced by the accumulated charge and/or displacement damage\ncaused by particles\u2019 energy deposition within device structures. For example, changes in\nthreshold voltage and increases in leakage current occur due to hole-trapping within\nthe field and gate oxides of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices exposed to\nionizing radiation.\n\nThe total dose tolerance of COTS devices varies widely. Some parts fail at less than 5\nkrad (Si) total dose, whilst others may survive as much as 100 krad (Si). A figure of 5 krad\n\n\n\nCOTS COMPONENTS IN THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT 18.4 585\n\n(Si) can be taken to be a reasonable design limit for untested COTS parts. However, where\npossible, total dose test data on parts should be obtained, either from published sources,\nor from the results of ground testing using, for example, a Cobalt?60 ? -ray source.\n\nWhere a component is likely to receive more than its failure dose within the planned\nmission lifetime, the use of spot shielding by high-density metals (e.g. copper, tungsten or\ntantalum) should be considered, or if this is still insufficient, the part should be replaced\naltogether with a rad-hard version. Even so, total dose damage will accumulate, and thus\ndesign margins must be built into the spacecraft\u2019s systems to cope with the expected\nchanges\u2014particularly in terms of voltage level shifts and increased current consumption.\n\nSingle-event effects occur due to the charge deposited along the track of an ionizing\nparticle passing through a device structure. These effects may be temporary in nature, or\nmay lead to permanent damage.\n\nSEEs can be reproduced in proton or ion-beam tests, but generally these tests are\nexpensive to perform and require specialist high-energy particle accelerator facilities,\nwhich are not widely available. Useful test data may be found in published literature (for\nexample that resulting from the annual Nuclear and Space Radiation Effects Conference\n[NSREC] published in the IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science), or in on-line radiation\neffects databases. However, such data is no guarantee that an individual component is\nsafe to fly as there are often considerable batch-to-batch variations in radiation tolerance\nfor COTS devices.\n\nIn any case, it should be assumed that SEEs will occur, and that the spacecraft systems\nmust be designed with this in mind. SEEs include single-event upset (SEU) and single-\nevent latch-up (SEL) events. SEUs are unexpected, but impermanent changes in a device\u2019s\nstate. They can be corrected by error-detection and correction (EDAC), or majority voting\ncircuits. To prevent the accumulation of SEUs in semiconductor memories, the memory\nshould be washed (i.e. the contents read, corrected and re-written) on a regular basis.\nFigure 18.6 illustrates the occurrence of SEUs recorded in UoSAT-3 \u2019s program memory,\n\n90\n\n45\n\n0\n\n?45\n\n?90\n?180 ?90 0 90 180\n\nLongitude\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\nFigure 18.6 Single-event upsets in the S80/T on-board computer program memory at\n1330 km altitude (Reproduced by permission of University of Surrey)\n\n\n\n586 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nas detected and corrected during such a wash cycle. The correlation with the trapped\nprotons of the SAA (see Figure 18.5) is obvious.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to whether or not the part is SEL sensitive as this is a\ndestructive effect, which is hard to counter. SELs are usually permanent failures unless the\npower can be switched off rapidly, whereupon the device may recover. SEL-susceptible\nparts should be avoided if at all possible. In particular, parts that latch-up readily under\nproton bombardment should be rejected as unsuitable for use in space.\n\nNew threats are emerging for modern fast and complex digital devices, including the\nsingle-event transient (SET) error, where errors are propagated due to the current spike\nfrom a charged particle hit, and the single-event functional interrupt (SEFI), where the\ndevice goes into an unexpected non-functional state from which it cannot recover without\nthe power being cycled.\n\n18.4.4 Mechanical environment\n\nOnce in orbit, spacecraft experience a micro-gravity environment, which imposes rela-\ntively little mechanical stress on a spacecraft structure\u2014thermal effects excepted. How-\never, the act of launching a satellite does impart quite severe loads on the satellite\u2019s\nstructure\u2014not only from the acceleration of the launch vehicle, but also from the associ-\nated vibration and acoustic loads. During the ascent phase, the launch vehicle will undergo\nstage-separation, achieved through the firing of pyrotechnic devices, which may impart\nquite severe shock loads on the spacecraft. Thus, as with any spacecraft, microsatellites\nhave to be designed to be mechanically robust. This does not just apply to the struc-\nture of the spacecraft. The electrical components also have to be robustly mounted\u2014and\nparticular attention needs to be paid to the use of COTS electronic devices, where there\ncan easily be insufficient strength in the soldered connections to mechanically hold the\ndevice under the imparted loads. Devices should not be mounted too high off the printed\ncircuit boards (PCBs), and \u2018heavy\u2019 devices (e.g. large capacitors, crystals, etc.) should\nhave additional support in terms of straps to hold them in place. Plastic (vacuum-rated)\nconformal coatings and foams can also play a useful role in providing extra mechanical\nsupport. Vacuum-rated RTV silicone rubber is also useful in supporting wired connections\nto PCBs.\n\nOne factor that has to be considered very carefully is that of mechanical resonance.\nSmall satellites often fall in a mass-stiffness range that leads to them having resonant\nfrequencies of the order of a few tens of Hertz. This is just the frequency range where\nlaunch vehicles tend to produce large vibrational energies, and so satellites may experience\nsignificant amplification (or Q-factor) of the imparted loads. The mechanical structure\nshould therefore not be too stiff, and should include mechanisms to damp down vibrations\nand to dissipate energy.\n\nAny new microsatellite structure must undergo qualification vibration testing and shock\ntesting which is representative of the intended launch vehicle or vehicles. Once built, the\nflight-model satellite must also undergo a further set of vibration and shock tests to\nacceptance level to satisfy the launch agency that the satellite is sufficiently robust.\n\n\n\nMICROSATELLITE PLATFORMS 18.5 587\n\nFigure 18.7 UoSAT-1 (1981) showing interior, and exterior with three out of four\nbody-mounted solar panels attached (Reproduced by permission of University of\nSurrey)\n\n18.5 MICROSATELLITE PLATFORMS\n\nThe first modern microsatellites, such as UoSAT-1 shown in Figure 18.7, used a conven-\ntional mechanical structure with electronic module boxes clustered around a central thrust\ncolumn. Solar panels were body mounted to stringers supported from the end (Z-facet)\nhoneycomb panels. However the need to accommodate a variety of payload customers\nwithin a standard launcher envelope, coupled with increased demands on packing density,\nelectro-magnetic compatibility, economy of manufacture and ease of integration, led to\nthe development at Surrey during 1986 of a novel, modular design of a multi-mission\nmicrosatellite platform, where the electronics modules actually formed the primary struc-\nture of the spacecraft. The same scheme was adopted by US AMSAT and University\ngroups for their 1990-launched microsatellites, and it has subsequently been used by\nmany countries developing their own small spacecraft. Indeed, the modular microsatel-\nlite platform has been the mainstay of the commercial/technology-transfer microsatellite\nprogrammes undertaken by Surrey\u2019s commercial arm SSTL. As of 2009, this platform\nhad been used successfully on over thirty different SSTL missions, each with different\npayload requirements, allowing the spacecraft to proceed from order-to-orbit in typically\n12\u201318 months.\n\nThe SSTL modular microsatellite, shown in Figure 18.8, has no \u2018skeleton\u2019 but rather\na series of identical outline machined module boxes, stacked one on top of the other, to\nform a body onto which solar panels and instruments may be mounted. The modules are\nheld together by tie-rods that pass through the whole stack, and allow some dissipation\n\n\n\n588 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nEarth observation compartment\n(EOC)\n\nUHF antennas\n\nBoom (Stowed)\n\nVHF Antennas\n\nTipmass\n\nAttach Fitting\n\nSun sensor\n\n26\n\nEarth observation\nplatform (EOP)\n\nG\nP\n\nS\n\nAttitude Determination, Control and Safety Module\n\nTMSAT\nPower system\n\n(11)\n\n26On-Board Computer Module(6)\n\n26Telemetry and Telecommand Module(5)\n\n35Power Module(4)\n\n32Downlink Module(3)\n\n32Uplink Module(2)\n\n50Battery Module(1)\n\n26(10)\n\n26(9)\n\n26(8)\n\n32(7)\n\nGPS\n\nFigure 18.8 Example module box, with schematic showing the construction of a\ntypical SSTL modular microsatellite (Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\nof vibrational energy. Whilst this does limit the maximum potential height of the stack,\nin practice this is not a problem in the context of microsatellite mass constraints. Larger\nspacecraft can use multiple stacks (see Section 18.6).\n\nAt the lower end of the microsatellite mass scale, the ?10 kg AMSAT microsatellites\ntypically have five stacked module trays, forming a cubic-structure with body-mounted\nsolar panels on all six facets. These panels typically provide between 6\u201316 W of electri-\ncal power. Communications, are provided by standard amateur radio uplinks/down-links\n(e.g. 2 m, 70 cm, 23 cm and/or 13 cm wavelengths) using the AX.25 packet protocol. This\nprotocol was developed in the mid-1980s by AMSAT groups (including Surrey) as a\nwireless-compatible extension of the standard X.25 wide-area network computer commu-\nnication protocol. The \u2018packetized\u2019 nature of the transmissions\u2014both to and from the\nground\u2014gives the ability to support several \u2018virtual\u2019 links to the spacecraft operating\nover a single RF carrier. Thus telemetry, telecommand, software up-loads and payload\ndata can all be supported over a single duplex RF link.\n\nSuch small, low-cost microsatellites have limited attitude control\u2014usually confined to\npassive alignment to the local magnetic field achieved via permanent magnets. Sometimes\nthe antennas are black-and-white painted so as to impart a slow spin to aid thermal con-\ntrol. The use of more-or-less omni-directional antennae means that the satellites can carry\nout their primary role as amateur-radio communication transponders without the need for\n\n\n\nMICROSATELLITE PLATFORMS 18.5 589\n\naccurate pointing control or knowledge. However, high-gain communications transponders\nand Earth-observation payloads do require an Earth-pointing facet or platform. Thus, a\ntypical 50 kg SSTL micro-satellite is maintained to within 1? of nadir by employing a com-\nbination of gravity-gradient stabilization using a pyro-released 6 m boom (see also Section\n9.4.3), and closed-loop active damping using electromagnets operated by the on-board\ncomputer. More recent spacecraft have used momentum wheels instead of gravity-gradient\nbooms to provide even more accurate attitude control (typically ?0.2?)\u2014however, this\ndoes introduce moving parts, which are inevitably less reliable. Thus, a gravity-gradient\nboom is usually retained, ready to be deployed should the wheels fail. Attitude determi-\nnation is provided by Sun sensors, geomagnetic field sensors (flux-gate magnetometers),\nand star field cameras, whilst orbital position is determined autonomously to with \u00b115 m\nby on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. Electrical power is typically gen-\nerated by four body-mounted GaAs solar array panels, each generating ?35 W, and is\nstored in a 7 A-h NiCd rechargeable battery. Communications are supported by very high\nfrequency (VHF), ultra high frequency (UHF), L-band and/or S-band uplinks/downlinks,\noperating on amateur, commercial or military bands depending on the mission context.\nThese satellites also use fully error-protected AX.25 packet link protocols operating at\ndata rates between 9.6 and 156 kbps.\n\nAt the higher end of the microsatellite mass scale, the latest generation of 100\u2013150 kg\nSSTL \u2018enhanced microsatellites\u2019, is based on the proven flight heritage of the 50 kg\nmicrosatellites, but are designed to support missions requiring larger or more demand-\ning payloads\u2014still at relatively low cost. The 600 \u00d7 600 \u00d7 500 mm bus structure\naccommodates larger solar panels, and provides flexible internal and external payload\naccommodation. Nevertheless, this bus fits comfortably on low-cost secondary payload\ncarriers such as the Ariane 5 Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP).\n\nSuch enhanced microsatellites (see Figure 18.9) give in excess of 100 W orbit average\npower. A full three-axis attitude control system allows payloads to be pointed at\nany terrestrial or celestial target with an accuracy of better than 0.1?.

Since the early 1990s a number of such satellites have been\nbuilt for just a few tens of millions of dollars\u2014low by conventional space standards. How-\never, in response to growing payload demands for power, volume and mass\u2014but within\nvery small-scale financial budgets\u2014there has been increasing interest in flying minisatel-\nlites constructed on the same principles as the microsatellites previously described.\n\nSSTL\u2019s first mini-satellite platform, shown in Figure 18.10, was designed according to\nsuch cost-effective principles\u2014resulting in a basic platform cost of \u00a35\u20136 million\n\nIn an age of decommissioning of nuclear weapons, it is interesting to note that UoSAT-\n12 was launched successfully by a converted SS-18 (Dnepr) Inter-continental Ballis-\ntic Missile (ICBM). Three-axis control was provided by a combination of magnetor-\nquers, momentum wheels and cold gas N2 thrusters\u2014whilst an experimental electric\nN2O resisto-jet thruster provided orbit trimming and maintenance demonstrations for\nfuture network constellations. Much of the technology proved on this mission has been\nincorporated into the current-generation of enhanced microsatellites\u2014demonstrating the\nimportant inter-play between technology demonstration missions and the development of\noperational spacecraft.\n\n18.7 NANOSATELLITE PLATFORMS\n\nAt the opposite end of the mass scale, the continuing trend in the miniaturization of tech-\nnology has raised interest in the development of really tiny spacecraft of just a few kg or\nless. Much of this interest has resided in the USA, particularly at the Aerospace Corpora-\ntion and amongst the military\u2014the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and\nthe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), who stimulated a programme\nof nanosatellite and picosatellite research in US Universities\u2014most notably at Stanford\nresulting in the CubeSat concept. Similar interest resides in European Universities includ-\ning Surrey with its PalmSat initiative. Early examples of such satellites include the 3 kg\nSPUTNIK-40\u2014a 40th anniversary commemorative one-third scale functional replica of\nthe original Sputnik, which was deployed from the MIR space-station in November 1997.\nSPUTNIK-40 was built by French students from l\u2019Aeroclub de France (responsible for\nthe radio transmitter), and staff from the Russian Aeronautical Federation (responsible\nfor the structure). This was followed in 1998 by the Technical University of Berlin\u2019s\n8 kg TUBSAT-N and 3 kg TUBSAT-N1, launched on a Shtil-1 converted missile from a\nRussian nuclear-powered submarine. The follow-up SPUTNIK-41 was also launched in\n1998. However, it is the new millennium that has ushered in the new era of sophisticated\nnanosatellites and picosatellites, starting with a group of six ?250 ? 500 g picosatellites\nlaunched from Stanford\u2019s OPAL microsatellite in January 2000. This launch also saw\nthe flight of Arizona State University\u2019s 5 kg ASUSAT-1, and the US military JAWSAT\nnanosatellites, which enjoyed mixed success.\n\n\n\nNANOSATELLITE PLATFORMS 18.7 591\n\nFigure 18.10 SSTL\u2019s 312 kg UoSAT-12 minisatellite, launched in 1999 (Reproduced by\npermission of SSTL)\n\nIn June 2000, the UK launched its first nanosatellite\u2014the 6.5 kg SNAP-1, designed\nand built at Surrey in just nine months. SNAP-1 is a highly-integrated and sophisticated\nspacecraft carrying advanced microminiature GPS navigation, CMOS video camera tech-\nnology, on-board computing, propulsion and attitude control technologies.

To get a sense of scale,\nthe circular plate it stands on is approximately the size of a dinner plate.\n\nSNAP-1\u2019s primary payload is a machine vision system (MVS) that enables it to inspect\nother spacecraft in orbit. The MVS consist of three ultra-miniature wide-angle CMOS\nvideo cameras and one narrow-angle CMOS video camera\u2014each weighing just a few\n\n\n\n592 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nMachine vision system\n\nFigure 18.11 (a) The SNAP-1 nanosatellite, (b) the SNAP-1 MVS payload, (c) the\nRussian Nadezhda search-and-rescue satellite imaged by SNAP-1 in orbit (Reproduced\nby permission of University of Surrey/SSTL)\n\ngrams, together with sophisticated image processing electronics supported by a 220 MHz\nStrongARM RISC processor (see Figure 18.11b). The MVS has been used to image the\nRussian Nadezhda satellite (see Figure 18.11c), which carried SNAP into orbit, and in\nparticular was used to monitor the deployment of another SSTL microsatellite into space.\nSubsequently, the MVS has been used to provide medium (500 m) resolution near-IR\nimages of the Earth from SNAP-1\u2019s 650 km altitude, near-polar orbit.\n\nSNAP-1\u2019s miniature cold-gas propulsion system, which uses butane as a propellant, has\nbeen used to manoeuvre SNAP-1 with respect to the Chinese Tsinghua-1 micro-satellite.\nFigure 18.12(a) shows the miniature thrusters and fuel reservoir, developed by SSTL and\nPolyflex Ltd, and Figure 18.12(b) shows a graph of the time history of the altitude of\nSNAP-1 and Tsinghua-1, as recorded by their respective on-board GPS navigation sys-\ntems. Tsinghua-1, which has no propulsion, falls naturally under the action of atmospheric\ndrag. SNAP-1 falls rapidly at first (a feature of nanosatellites due to their poor ballistic\nratio), but climbs rapidly once autonomous orbital manoeuvres are initiated. Intense solar\nactivity meant that SNAP-1 fell more rapidly than planned, and so a second sequence of\nfirings was initiated before SNAP was allowed to fall onto Tsinghua-1\u2019s orbit.\n\nSince SNAP-1, many CubeSat missions have been launched, starting with the first\nbatch in June 2003. These satellites have principally been used as practical space engi-\nneering education test beds\u2014most often as \u2018flying cameras\u2019. However, some have also\nprovided significant functionality such as demonstrating new technologies, including\nmicro-electrical-mechanical systems (MEMS), the Automatic Identification System (AIS)\nsignal tracking, tether experiments and space environment monitoring.\n\nFuture applications for the nanosatellite include the remote inspection of satellites (e.g.\nthe International Space Station), monitoring of deployments systems in orbit, and demon-\nstrating swam control and formation flying techniques.\n\n18.8 AFFORDABLE LAUNCHES FOR SMALL SATELLITES\n\nA sustained, commercial, low-cost small satellite programme must also be matched by\ncorrespondingly inexpensive and regular access to orbit through formal launch service\ncontracts\u2014as it makes little sense to construct sophisticated yet inexpensive microsatel-\nlites if the launch costs remain prohibitively high. The majority of microsatellites have\nbeen launched as \u2018piggy-back\u2019 or secondary payloads accompanying a larger primary\npayload into orbit\u2014where the primary payload pays for the majority of the launch cost.\n\n\n\nAFFORDABLE LAUNCHES FOR SMALL SATELLITES 18.8 593\n\n(a)\n\n7075\n\n7074.5\n\n7074\n\n7073.5\n\n7073\n\n7072.5\n\n7072\n150 200 250 300 350 400 450\n\nSNAP-1\norbital\ninjection\n\nTsinghua-1\norbital\ninjection\n\nAltitude boost\nfirings begin\n\nSecond\nsequence\nbegins\n\nSecond\nsequence\nends\n\n'Snap.dat'\n\n'tsing.dat'\n\nFirst boost\nsequence ends\n\nRendezvous\n\n(b) Day number from 1 Jan 2000\n\nS\nem\n\ni-m\naj\n\nor\nax\n\nis\n / \n\nkm\n\nFigure 18.12 (a) SNAP-1 butane cold-gas thrusters and (b) SNAP-1 orbital\nmanoeuvres, showing the SNAP-1 semi-major axis compared with the target spacecraft\n(Reproduced by permission of University of Surrey/SSTL)\n\n\n\n594 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nDelta Ariane Tsyklon Zenit SS18/Dnepr Cosmos Athena\n\nFigure 18.13 Example launch vehicles used for small satellite missions (Reproduced\nby permission of SSTL)\n\nSuch launch services are available on a diversity of expendable boosters, as shown in\nFigure 18.13 (see also Chapter 7).\n\nEarly microsatellites (particularly the amateur radio satellites) were launched virtually\nfor free on a \u2018favour\u2019 basis by the USA and former-USSR (now Confederation of Indepen-\ndent States\u2014CIS), but these launch opportunities were infrequent and unpredictable. The\nbreakthrough came in 1988 when Arianespace developed the Ariane Structure for Auxil-\niary Payloads (ASAP) ring specifically to provide, for the first time, regular and affordable\nlaunch opportunities for 50 kg microsatellites into both LEO and GTO on a commercial\nbasis. Figure 18.14 shows two UoSAT and four US AMSAT microsatellites mounted\non the first ASAP, which flew with the French SPOT-2 spacecraft as primary payload.\nMore than 20 microsatellites were launched via the Ariane-4 ASAP, and Ariane-5 has an\nenhanced ASAP capability. However, whilst it has been key in providing microsatellite\nlaunches world-wide, Ariane alone cannot now provide the number of launch opportu-\nnities into LEO needed to meet the burgeoning growth of small satellites. Alternatively,\ninexpensive launch options from the CIS (on Tsyklon, Zenit, and Cosmos) are now being\nused increasingly for microsatellites/minisatellites, with the microsatellites often directly\nattached to the primary payload (see Figure 18.15).\n\nWithin the last few years, the large stockpiles of ICBMs in the CIS have become\navailable for use as small launchers through the de-militarilization programme (e.g. SS-\n18/Dnepr; SS-19/Rockot; SS-25/START). Indeed, SSTL co-operated with ISC Kosmotras\n(Moscow) to convert the SS-18 ICBM into the first Dnepr small satellite launcher for the\nsuccessful launch of the UoSAT-12 minisatellite from a silo at Baikonur in April 1999,\nas illustrated in Figure 18.16.\n\nFor CubeSats, a number of commercial suppliers offer launch opportunities, including\nCalPoly, with their P-POD deployer (co-developed with Stanford), Innovative Solution\nin Space (ISIS) and the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS),\nwith their X-POD deployer that can be tailored to nanosatellites as well as CubeSats.\n\n18.9 IN-ORBIT OPERATIONS\n\nThe last element of the low cost small satellite equation is in-orbit operations (see also\nChapter 14). Compact and low-cost mission control ground-stations have been developed\nto operate microsatellites once in orbit. An example is shown if Figure 18.17. These\n\n\n\nIN-ORBIT OPERATIONS 18.9 595\n\nFigure 18.14 Micro-satellites mounted as auxiliary payloads on the ASAP ring\n(Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\nground-stations are based on PCs and are highly automated\u2014interacting autonomously\nwith the microsatellite in orbit\u2014to reduce manpower requirements and to increase relia-\nbility. For example, the SSTL Mission Control Centre at Surrey currently operates multiple\nsatellites in LEO and one in medium Earth orbit (MEO) with just a single operator. Such\nfacilities rely on the spacecraft themselves having a high level of autonomy , as, in practice,\nthe satellites only spend a small fraction of their time in range of any single ground-station\n(typically 1 h per day for a LEO polar orbiter over a mid-latitude ground-station). Thus,\nthe investment in ground-station and satellite software should not be underestimated.\nIndeed, the total amount of software on board a typical microsatellite is of the order of\nseveral hundreds of kbytes\u2014perhaps an order of magnitude greater than that in a typical\nconventional spacecraft. Similarly, the ground-station tracking and data handling software\ncomprises many thousands of lines of code.\n\n\n\n596 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nFigure 18.15 Micro-satellites mounted directly on the primary payload spacecraft\n(Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\nFigure 18.16 Silo launch of a minisatellite using a converted SS-18 ICBM (Reproduced\nby permission of SSTL)\n\n\n\nSMALL SATELLITE APPLICATIONS 18.10 597\n\nFigure 18.17 Mission control ground station at SSTL\u2019s Tycho House site, Guildford, UK\n(Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\n18.10 SMALL SATELLITE APPLICATIONS\n\n18.10.1 Small satellites for communications\n\nSatellite communications have become synonymous with large geostationary satellites\nfor transparent real-time wideband services. Satellites in low Earth orbits are closer to\nthe user and the consequent reduction in transmission loss and delay-time are attractive,\nholding out the promise of less expensive ground terminals and regional frequency reuse.\nNevertheless, the communications characteristics associated with a LEO constellation pose\nquite different and demanding problems, such as varying communications path and links,\nhigh Doppler shifts, and hand-over from satellite to satellite. The use of early internet-like\ncommunication techniques was pioneered on microsatellites by the US military: GLOMR,\n(1985), MACSAT (1990) and at Surrey: UoSAT-2 (1984), UoSAT-3 (1990), to provide\nworld-wide non-real-time digital data store-and-forward e-mail connectivity\u2014especially\nto remote regions where existing the telecommunications infra-structure is inadequate or\nnon-existent [6]. Two SSTL microsatellites (HealthSat-1 and 2) were procured by SatelLife\n(USA) to provide routine e-mail communications for medical teams and aid workers\nin the Third World. As another example, PoSAT-1 was used to provide military e-mail\ncommunications for Portugal during the Bosnia crisis. Figure 18.18 shows a polar scientist\nusing portable hand-held equipment to communicate home via an SSTL microsatellite.\n\nThe minisatellite platform provides a means of carrying real-time communications\ntransponders into geostationary orbit.\n\n\n\n598 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nFigure 18.18 Using hand-held equipment to send e-mails from remote areas via\nmicrosatellites (Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\n18.10.2 Small satellites for space science\n\nMicrosatellites and minisatellites can offer a very quick turnaround and relatively inex-\npensive means of exploring well-focused, small-scale science objectives (e.g. detecting\nX-rays, monitoring the space radiation environment, updating the international geo-\nmagnetic reference field, etc.)\u2014examples being the UK\u2019s ARIEL series and the 74 kg\nAMPTE-UKS (1984), the 286 kg Swedish VIKING (1986) and ASTRID series, and the\n62 kg Danish OERSTED (1999). They can also provide a means of proof-of-concept\nprior to the development of large-scale instrumentation in a fully complementary manner\nto expensive, long-gestation, large-scale space science missions. This not only yields sci-\nentific data quickly, but also provides opportunities for young scientists and engineers to\ngain \u2018real-life\u2019 experience of satellite and payload engineering\u2014an invaluable experience\nfor later large-scale missions. For example, a doctoral student can initiate a programme\nof research, propose and build an instrument, and retrieve orbital data for analysis and\npresentation for a thesis within a normal period of post-graduate study. Eight Surrey\nmicrosatellites have carried payloads to monitor the near-Earth radiation environment\n(see Figure 18.5). Ground-based numerical models have been validated with flight data,\nand simultaneous measurements have been made of the radiation environment and its\ninduced effects upon on-board systems. A collaborative micro-satellite mission with\nChile, FASat-Bravo (1998), carried UV-imaging cameras and UV-radiometers as part\nof the Ozone Layer Monitoring Experiment (OLME), which provided unique data on the\nozone concentrations and structure in the Earth\u2019s polar regions, as shown in Figure 18.19.\n\n18.10.3 Small satellites for technology verification\n\nMicrosatellites also provide an attractive, low-cost and rapid means of demonstrating,\nverifying and evaluating new technologies or services in a realistic orbital environment\n\n\n\nSMALL SATELLITE APPLICATIONS 18.10 599\n\n140\n\n15\n0\u00b0\n\nW\n\n60\u00b0S\n\n45\u00b0S\n\n30\u00b0S\n\n15\u00b0S\n0\u00b0N\n\n15\u00b0N\n30\u00b0N\n\n45\u00b0N\n\n60\u00b0N\n\nOMAD O3 Vertical Column [DU]\nDays: 15   Month: 10   Year: 98\n\n12\n0\u00b0\n\nW\n\n90\n\u00b0W\n\n60\n\u00b0W\n\n30\n\u00b0W 0\u00b0\n\nE\n\n30\n\u00b0E\n\n60\n\u00b0E\n\n90\n\u00b0E\n\n12\n0\u00b0\n\nE\n\n15\n0\u00b0\n\nE\n\n210 280 350 420\n\nFigure 18.19 Total ozone concentration (in Dobson Units - DU) measured by the\nFASat-Bravo Ozone Layer Monitoring Experiment (Reproduced by permission of\nUniversity of Surrey)\n\nand within acceptable risks, prior to a commitment to a full-scale, expensive mission.\nThe UK\u2019s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency\u2019s (now known as QinetiQ) STRV-1\n(1994) series of micro-satellites are prime examples\u2014designed to test new technologies\nin the harsh environment of GTO. For example, one of their experiments tested the\nperformance of new solar cells. Satellites depend upon the performance of solar cell\narrays for the production of primary power to support on-board housekeeping systems and\npayloads throughout their 7\u201315 years operational lifetime in orbit. Knowledge of the long-\nterm behaviour of different types of cells in the radiation environment experienced in orbit\nis, therefore, essential. Unfortunately, ground-based, short-term radiation susceptibility\ntesting does not necessarily yield accurate data on the eventual in-orbit performance of the\ndifferent cells and hence there is a real need for evaluation in an extended realistic orbital\nenvironment. UoSAT-5 (1991) carried a pre-cursor Solar Cell Technology Experiment\n(SCTE) designed to evaluate the performance in LEO of a range of 27 samples of GaAs,\nSi and InP solar cells from a variety of manufacturers, as shown in Figure 18.20.\n\n18.10.4 Small satellites for Earth observation\n\nMicrosatellites have really brought about a revolution in Earth observation. Conventional\nEarth observation and remote sensing satellite missions are extremely costly\u2014$500\nmillion is not unusual. Thus, there are relatively few such missions and the resulting data,\nwhilst providing impressive spatial and spectral resolution, yield poor temporal resolution\n(revisit) of ground targets due to the small numbers of these spacecraft actually in orbit.\nA new opportunity for remote sensing using inexpensive small satellites has come with\nthe availability of (1) high-density two-dimensional-array semiconductor charge-coupled\n\n\n\n600 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nNew Solar Cell \ntechnologies tested in \nthe real space radiation \nenvironment \n(GaAs, InPe, Si)\n\nRADFET \nRadiation Dose \nMonitors\n\nNew Thermal \n\n \n\n \n\nNew thermal \ncontrol surfaces\n\nRADFET \nradiation dose\nmonitors\n\nUoSAT-5  microsatellite\n\nHealthSat-2 microsatellite\n\n \nNew solar cell\ntechnologies tested in\nthe real space radiation\nenvironment\n(GaAs, InPe, Si)\n\nFigure 18.20 New technology demonstration experiments on UoSAT-5 (Reproduced\nby permission of SSTL)\n\ndevice (CCD) optical detectors (as used in consumer video and digital still cameras),\nand (2) low-power consumption yet computationally powerful microprocessors. In fact,\nUoSAT-1 (1981) and -2 (1984) both carried experimental first-generation 2D-CCD\nEarth-imaging cameras. These paved the way for the first operational cameras on board\nUoSAT-5 (1991), which was able to image the oil well fires in Kuwait resulting from\nthe 1st Gulf war\u2014the only privately owned Earth-imaging satellite able to do so. The\nTsinghua-1 microsatellite launched in June 2000 provides remarkable 35 m resolution\nimages in four spectral bands (compatible with LANDSAT) with the capability of \u00b115?\n(\u00b1200 km) off-nadir imaging coverage upon demand\u2014all at a total mission cost of \u00a33.5\nmillion, launched into orbit. Minisatellites and enhanced microsatellites have been able to\nachieve even better results. For example, the 103 kg Korean KITSAT-3 satellite, launched\nin 1999, produced 17 m ground-resolution images in red, green and near-IR bands, whilst\nthe Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) and RapidEye enhanced microsatellites\nhave shown that fully commercial Earth Observation constellations are viable, with up to\n?7 m ground resolution multi-spectral and 4 m ground resolution panchromatic imaging\ncapability. Examples of small-satellite Earth-imaging capability are shown in Figure 18.21.\n\n18.10.5 Small satellites for military applications\n\nMuch of the use of small-satellite technology over the years has been driven by the require-\nments of the military\u2014particularly in the USA and former USSR. Whilst these spacecraft\nhave tended to be conventional\u2014albeit small\u2014there has been increasing interest in taking\na more cost-effective approach.\n\nThe demands of military-style satellite procurement and the cost-effective approach\nto microsatellite engineering might, at first sight, appear incompatible. However, whilst\nretaining the essential characteristics of low cost and rapid response, a military version\nof the SSTL microsatellite platform with deployable solar panels has been developed to\nsupport various military payloads. The main difference between the \u2018commercial\u2019 and\n\n\n\nSMALL SATELLITE APPLICATIONS 18.10 601\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 18.21 DMC constellation imagery: (a) 32 m resolution three-band multi-spectral\nimage of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, Spring 2006\u2014used by the UN Office on\nDrugs and Crime (UNODC) for opium poppy crop estimates (draped over a digital\nelevation model).

An\noptimum trade-off between the constraints of a military programme and economy has\nbeen sought, which results in an \u2018increase factor\u2019 for cost and timescale of approximately\n1.5 when compared to the \u2018commercial\u2019 microsatellite procurement process.\n\nPractical examples of where small satellites and groups of small satellites have been\nemployed in military scenarios include:\n\n\u2022 US TRANSIT programme, where small satellites were employed within a military\nnavigation system.\n\n\u2022 US MACSAT and Portuguese PoSAT missions, where satellites were used by small\ndivisions for digital store-and-forward communications.\n\n\u2022 US MICROSAT constellation of seven satellites for battlefield communications.\n\u2022 French military CLEMENTINE and CERISE spacecraft, which have been employed\n\nin electronic intelligence gathering.\n\u2022 TechSAT-21 mission, which will employ small satellites for radar imaging\n\nand geo-location.\n\nThe first use of the SSTL military microsatellite platform was on the CERISE mission,\ndesigned and built for the French MoD and launched into a 700 km low Earth orbit by\nAriane in July 1995 (see Figure 18.22). After a year of perfect operations, CERISE made\nhistory as the first operational satellite to be (knowingly) struck by a piece of space debris\n\nFigure 18.22 The CERISE spacecraft, built for the French Defence Ministry\n(Reproduced by permission of SSTL)\n\n\n\nPICOSATELLITES AND RECENT ADVANCES IN MINIATURIZATION 18.11 603\n\nFigure 18.23 TOPSat\u2014a high-resoultion imaging satellite.

However, due to the flexibility of\nthe microsatellite systems, SSTL engineers were able to re-stabilize CERISE by uploading\nnew attitude control algorithms, returning it to operations. A second microsatellite for the\nFrench MOD (CLEMENTINE) was launched into LEO in 1999 and a third microsatel-\nlite (called PICOsat) was launch successfully on 30th September 2001 for the United\nStates Air Force (USAF), carrying advanced technology payloads for the US Department\nof Defense.\n\nThe use of microsatellites to provide agile, 2.8 m resolution imaging for military appli-\ncations was demonstrated in 2005 on the TOPSat microsatellite, built jointly by SSTL,\nRAL (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) and QinetiQ. Figure 18.23 shows the TOPsat\nspacecraft, giving an idea of the relatively large optical bench needed to obtain such high\nresolution images.\n\n18.11 PICOSATELLITES AND RECENT ADVANCES\n\nIN MINIATURIZATION\n\nThe drive towards small hand-held computers and mobile communications equipment\nhas stimulated even further miniaturization\u2014specifically in low-power microprocessors,\n\n\n\n604 SMALL SATELLITE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS\n\nefficient transmitters, low mass and high capacity battery technology, and low power\nGPS receivers.\n\nThis has been followed by specific developments of mobile multimedia systems such\nas digital cameras, spurring low cost, low power, high density data storage as well as\nhigh resolution imaging sensors. Recent trends have also tended towards full integration\nof electronics onto a single chip (System-on-a-Chip), which is particularly applicable to\npicosatellite technology (Spacecraft-on-A-Chip). Other technological advances in these\nareas can be summarized as follows.\n\nMicro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) use integrated circuit manufacturing\ntechniques to develop miniature mechanical assemblies together with electronics, and\nhave found early mass market utilization in air-bag deployment sensors and ink-jet\nprinter heads.\n\nCustom devices can be manufactured to order, and in conjunction with application-\nspecific integrated circuit (ASIC) technologies will soon enable entire spacecraft avionics\nsystems, including sensors and actuators, to be assembled within \u2018sugarcube\u2019 volumes.\nAlready, inertial guidance platforms of the order just a few mm across are available, as\nare some micro-propulsion systems. Much of this work is taking place in US research\nfacilities such as Sandia National Laboratories. Wafer-scale integration of electronic and\nMEMS technology expands the opportunities, and is the basis of a highly advanced and\nintegrated nanosatellite/picosatellite proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the US.\n\nSome technologies are driven by space commercialization, including advances in ground\nsegment systems and highly efficient, radiation-tolerant multi-junction solar cells.\n\nOver the next decade, the outcome of these technologies should be the availability of\ntiny, sophisticated and intelligent satellites which can be mass-produced cheaply. Such\nsatellites could (potentially) be launched by the thousand, and could have sufficient\non-board and distributed intelligence to be self-organizing\u2014essentially synthesizing\nfunctions through mass action. Quite what the applications of such satellites will be\nremains to be seen.\n\n18.12 CONCLUSION\n\nThe modern concept of the micro-satellite appeared in 1981 with the application of\nadvanced microprocessors and other COTS technologies to the kind of low-cost satel-\nlite platforms developed by amateur radio enthusiasts during the 1970s. The 1990s saw\nthe rapid commercialization of these technologies, and now low-cost microsatellites are\nplaying an important role in enabling emerging space nations to carry out increasingly\nsophisticated space missions including communications, Earth observation, space science\nand technology demonstration. It would be wrong to directly relate low-cost to the small\nsize of the satellites. Cost-effectiveness comes through the application of a particular\ndesign philosophy\u2014not only to the satellites, but to all aspects of the mission. It is this\ndesign philosophy which really defines the concept of a \u2018small\u2019 satellite mission. The con-\ntrast between the small satellite approach, and that of conventional satellites, has meant\nthat the smaller, faster, cheaper ideal has seen most success in small companies and\nresearch groups, rather than in large aerospace organizations.\n\nAs we enter the new Millenium, rapid progress in the miniaturization of COTS elec-\ntronics and the advent of MEMS technology has ushered in a new era of even smaller\nnanosatellites and picosatellites which are opening up new mission scenarios\u2014often\n\n\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY 605\n\ninvolving the use of clusters of satellites to synthesize a particular function. The next\ndecade is likely to see viable satellites mass-produced at the \u2018chip\u2019 level.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Davidoff, M.

These usually occurred on large projects typically funded\nby governments, or sometimes by wealthy individuals. Taxpayers did not like to see their\nmoney wasted. The idea emerged that some early checking would be worthwhile even if\nit added to cost, because the later cost of failure was so large.\n\n19.1.1 The origins of Product Assurance\n\nReliability , as a formal discipline, emerged during the era of railways when the lifetimes\nof rolling stock had to be determined to plan replacement of bearings and other wear-\nout items before a breakage or worse, a loss of life, occurred. Regular inspections were\nscheduled to monitor wear and tear and this resulted in fewer derailments. Later, the\nuse of electrical machines increased during the industrial era, and they too manifested\nfailures\u2014under-sizing of parts, overwork in application, environmental stresses, etc. Still\nlater, Werner von Braun developed the V2 missile and probability-of-success (reliability)\nwas introduced instead of the percent-of-many statistics used previously.\n\nQuality Assurance (QA), as a formal discipline, emerged from the experience of oper-\nating warships at sea in the 1930s and 1940s. The increasing use of electronics for\ncommunications and radar meant that ships used about 4000\u20135000 valves (vacuum tubes).\nThese failed so often that engineers were replacing them on a more-or-less continuous\nbasis. The ship would be unavailable for service for much of its time.

In time,\nrising prices forced a clear two-part quality objective:\n\n1) reduce failures reaching the user,\n2) cut internal waste.\n\n19.1.2 Evolution of Product Assurance\n\nIn the decades following, pressures to deliver higher, more sustainable quality have\nincreased as a response to several factors:\n\n\u2022 Rising maintenance costs\n\u2022 Relentless pursuit of \u2018more-for-the-$\u2019\n\u2022 Reliability / Performance incentives\n\u2022 Just-in-time delivery requirements\n\n\u2022 Fast changes in market demand\n\u2022 Longer guarantees and warranties\n\u2022 Laws on \u2018fitness-for-purpose\u2019\n\u2022 Laws on product liability\n\n\u2022 Buyers demand Certification to ISO 9000/9001/9002 standards[1]\n[1]Note that Certification of an organization to ISO 9000 series standard(s) does not guarantee that\nthe customer will get what they ordered\u2014for example the supplier may go bankrupt. If the\ncustomer does get what he ordered, it will be of good quality and match the customer\u2019s needs.\nThis implies that the buyer must look at the robustness of the supplier\u2019s accounts as well as any\nISO accreditation before placing an order.\n\nInitiatives by quality experts have led to Quality Circles aimed at introducing continuous\nimprovement, for example, Zero-Defect methods where an operator who does something\nwrong, and alerts his supervisor to it, is not blamed or victimized. Both \u2018Total Quality\nManagement\u2019 and \u2018Re-engineering the Corporation\u2019 are aimed at management efficiency\nwith quality being a major part of the excellence objective.\n\n19.1.3 Product Assurance for space systems\n\nSpace systems differ from other forms of engineering in several respects. For example,\nin a typical launch vehicle, fuel-feed turbines operate at very high rotation rates, with\na temperature of 2000?C+ on one side, and fuel/oxidizer at cryogenic temperatures on\nthe other side. The vehicle also sustains continuous high acceleration and vibration, and\nupper stages operate in vacuum (see Chapter 2).\n\nSpacecraft are not maintainable (except the Hubble Space Telescope, STS Shuttle and\nISS), so spare equipment has to be carried on-board despite the mass penalty (require-\nment for a more expensive launcher). The spacecraft must not fail irrevocably from an\nanomaly, so recovery must be pre-planned in design to include a Failure Detection, Isola-\ntion and Recovery (FDIR) function. Deep space probes are a special case\u2014the total time\ntaken for transmitted telemetry (showing a fault) to reach the operator\u2019s console, to be\nassessed and for a corrective command to be sent back to the spacecraft can be huge. Even\nthen, its effect has to be confirmed through telemetry returned from the spacecraft. Three\nground-spacecraft distances must be traversed by the radio signals. Deep space probes\nmust therefore survive failures for many hours, without any intervention by an operator.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE IN A PROJECT 19.2 609\n\nHigh quality parts and materials and ultra-clean manufacturing processes are routinely\napplied to prevent failures resulting from ageing effects or contamination. The space envi-\nronment is one of vacuum, radiation and large temperature changes in which components\nand materials must survive and function properly over long periods.\n\n19.2 PRODUCT ASSURANCE IN A PROJECT\n\n19.2.1 General\n\nEngineers like to use the latest technology\u2014higher efficiency, less consumption of\npower, lower mass, and so on. Project managers on the other hand like to be always\nslightly ahead of schedule, and with a margin of unused resources to solve unforeseen\nengineering problems.\n\nIn a spacecraft project, PA acts as the \u2018conscience\u2019 of the project team. The PA role\nis not to counter innovation, nor to use up resources unnecessarily, but it does focus\non achieving required performance in orbit throughout the planned mission lifetime, not\njust at the start. All elements on a flight spacecraft must be qualified for the application\nand environment. Where a new part is proposed by engineering, it has to go through a\nqualification process at a cost to the project. If a particular process is difficult to execute,\nor critical to mission success, the engineers who perform it must be properly trained and\nproficiency-tested to the necessary standard. The process outcome is also inspected.\n\nThe product assurance engineer makes reliability predictions using approved failure\nrates, promulgates PA standards, witnesses key tests and inspects workmanship.\n\nThe \u2018good product assurance engineer\u2019 also investigates the validity of failure rates,\nchecks that the PA standards are applicable and are applied, checks the calibration records\nof the test equipment and employs the workmanship standard for inspection.\n\nThe general principle here is:\n\nG .P .1\u2014For every PA task, and to the greatest extent possible, verify the assumptions\nrelied upon by the PA task being performed.\n\nIt is sometimes said that: \u2018if anything can go wrong, it will go wrong\u2019 (Murphy\u2019s Law)\nThe PA function exists both to prevent and to correct problems. The cost of prevention\nis usually less than correcting a problem after it has occurred.\n\nPA engineers constantly have finely balanced judgments to make. These include:\n\n\u2022 insisting on a re-test, when it adds to costs and results in delay,\n\u2022 inspector\u2019s rejection of a device, which similarly adds to costs,\n\u2022 disposition as \u2018scrap\u2019 can be costly when no spares are available, because a new\n\ndevice has to be purchased or manufactured, and this results in a project schedule\ndelay\u2014itself adding to cost,\n\n\u2022 an error in a flight control procedure or contingency procedure can be argued to be a\nfailing of PA, and yet it is the spacecraft operations team who creates the procedures\nand checks them out with spacecraft simulators,\n\n\u2022 an in-orbit failure that ends a spacecraft mission can lead to a large insurance claim.\nInsurers always receive a presentation of a detailed post-failure investigation report.\nThey also question experts\u2014including the PA staff\u2014who are accountable!\n\n\n\n610 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nWhenever and wherever something does go wrong, PA staff usually get the blame.\n\nG .P .2\u2014Seek out and understand all unknowns and be fully satisfied that (a) they are\ncharacterized by a PA activity and (b) adverse effects are mitigated, before signing\noff any document.\n\nThis principle applies as much in design, manufacture, assembly, integration and test\nas it does to anomalies that occur in orbit.\n\n19.2.2 Product Assurance definitions and principles\n\nThe following form the foundation of all PA activities:\n\nProduct Assurance (definition)\u2014A discipline devoted to the study, planning and imple-\nmentation of activities intended to assure that the design, controls, methods and\ntechniques in a project result in a satisfactory level of quality in a product.\n\nQuality (definition)\u2014The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service\nthat bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.\n\nG.P.3\u2014Basis of Quality (principle)\u2014The ultimate Quality of a product depends on\ncontrol over design as well as manufacture and test.\n\nG.P.4\u2014Proof of Quality (principle)\u2014Quality must be evident (contained within veri-\nfiable evidence), and demonstrable (capable of demonstration).\n\nThese general principles were promulgated by NATO since 1968 in the AQAP-1 Quality\nStandard [1]. These AQAP standards have long since been superseded, first by the British\nStandard: BS 5750 [2] in 1979, this being adopted later by the International Standards\nOrganisation ISO as a basis for the ISO 9000 series standards [3]. Even so, the AQAP\nprinciples are just as applicable today.\n\n19.2.3 PA objectives and project phases\n\nFigure 19.1 shows PA objectives in each project phase, as derived from the top objective:\n\u2018Performance shall be as required throughout planned life\u2019. See also Chapter 17.\n\nThe design and manufacture phases show the term \u2018Qualify Design\u2019. Its purpose is to\nshow that there is a defined baseline from which the end-product (e.g. the spacecraft)\ncan be built repeatedly to the same (qualified) standard. In the subsequent phase\u2014launch\nand commissioning\u2014this term mutates to \u2018Qualify Product\u2019. When the spacecraft is in\norbit, it must be checked out and its behaviour characterized sufficiently well for the\noperators to \u2018know their spacecraft\u2019. This In-Orbit-Test activity (see also Chapter 14)\ncan result in updates to the Flight Control Procedures (FCP) and Contingency Recovery\nProcedures (CRP). At the end-of-life (EOL), whether planned or premature, the task is\n\u2018Qualify Mission\u2019\u2014that is, the mission is assessed in retrospect to determine the extent\nto which it met the users\u2019 requirements and to derive lessons from the project experience.\nThe objective is to apply experience to improve the processes of design, manufacture,\ntest, in-orbit operations.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE IN A PROJECT 19.2 611\n\nPerformance shall be as required throughout Planned Life\n\nQualify Design\n\nMinimize Failure\nProbability\n\nPrepare and Maintain Operate Safely; Problem-Free\n\nDefine and Control\nConfiguration\n\nVerify Conformance to\nRequirements\n\nLaunch and Acquire\n\nQualify Product \n\nDetect / compensate for\nIn-orbit anomalies\n\nDecommission / disposal\n\nQualify design\n\nShow capability\nShow safety\nShow buildable / Testable\nShow qualifiable / Qualified\nEvidence of Qualification\n\nUse Low Fail Rate Elements\nDesign for Simplicity\nPrevent Failures Occurring\nHave Capability:\n- to overcome failures\n- to withstand failures\nUse only Elements with:\n- long ageing / wear-out life\n\nIdentify all elements\nDefine baseline\nControl Changes\nKeep Track of Status\n\nBuild Standard and Design\nPerformance and Margins\nNon-conformance Closure\nReadiness for use\n\nTo Approved Build Standard\nMake as designed\nPrevent damage to S/C\nDetect and remove:\n- non-conformances\n\nRe-Integrate and Verify / Test\nMate with Launcher\nMonitor / Maintain\n\nMonitor / maintain\nManoeuvre safely\nAcquire In-orbit Configuration\n\nCheckout prime functionality\nCheckout back-up functionality\nCharacterise In-orbit behaviour\nDetermine consumables life\n\nMinimise Risks: - to humans,\nto Products and to Environment\nMonitor and check health\nRoutine ops. &  mission products\n\nSurvive\nLimit / contain\nDetect / diagnose\nRecover safely & fully\nRecover degraded mission\n\nDispose of safely\nPreserve orbital resource\n\nQualify mission\n\nPost-mission assessment\n\nDesign Manufacture, AI&V Launch and Commissioning Operations\n\nFigure 19.1 PA objectives vs. project phases\n\nIn the design phase, \u2018Minimize Failure Probability\u2019 includes both prevention (use of\nhigh quality parts, materials and processes, withstanding failures) and correction (over-\ncoming failures using spare/redundant equipment).\n\nThe Manufacturing and AI&V phases include \u2018Define and Control Configuration\u2019 to\nensure that all persons work to the same up-to-date baseline (to avoid wasted effort). This\ncan be summarized as\n\nThe Baseline + All Approved Changes = Current Configuration.\n\u2018Verify Conformance to Requirements\u2019\u2014sometimes called Reconciliation\u2014shows\n\nthat the \u2018as-built\u2019 product matches the \u2018as-designed\u2019 product (as updated with approved\nchanges). This contributes part of the proof-of-quality evidence.\n\nAt the launch site, \u2018Prepare and Maintain\u2019 enables the project manager to be satisfied\nthat the spacecraft is in good condition up to the moment of launch. If any critical param-\neter is out-of-limits, the project manager can order a launch hold. On-orbit operations are\nperformed to \u2018Operate Safely; Problem Free\u2019, with anomalies compensated by a CRP.\n\n19.2.4 PA role in risk management\n\nRisk management is a management responsibility (see Table 19.1). The activity as for-\nmalized in standards is often delegated to PA staff because they are perceived to have\nthe right skills in \u2018what-if\u2019 studies, probability theory, probabilistic risk assessments and\nsuccess criteria.\n\nThe main features dealt with by project risk management are:\n\n\u2022 Risks are forces, or \u2018jolts\u2019, that have an adverse effect on the project plan.\n\u2022 Risk attributes include: likelihood or probability and type/magnitude of effect.\n\n\n\n612 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nTable 19.1 Typical Standards Tree (ESA), based upon the European Cooperation for\nSpace Standardization (ECSS) standards\n\nManagement Engineering Product Assurance\nECSS-M-ST- ECSS-E-ST- ECSS-Q-ST-\n\n10.

Software PA\n\n[1]Planned topics merged into other headings\n\n\u2022 Risks can manifest themselves in many ways: a threat of legal action; a delay in\ndelivery of a critical item; a potential failure of a test; unachievable qualification, etc.\n\n\u2022 Risks are the forewarning of \u2018if it can go wrong, then it will go wrong\u2019 problems.\n\u2022 Risks must be sought out, recorded, categorized and tracked.\n\u2022 Continuing effort must be applied to reduce or eliminate identified risks.\n\nIn most instances where risk management is applied in a project, the responsible staff\ncreate a risk register, listing and defining the discovered risks. Periodically, the register\nis reviewed to see what action has been applied to reduce each risk, and what reduction\nin likelihood and/or reduction in effect has been achieved. Newly added risks are also\nreviewed, and some identified risks are combined if they are very closely related. To help\nthe project manager digest the information in the risk register, identified risks are often\ncolour coded to guide attention, typically as:\n\nRed: unresolved, likely, imminent and/or severe in effect\nOrange: potentially severe effects and/or growing likelihood\nGreen: small likelihood and/or effect\nGrey: retired risk, no longer a threat\n\nProject risk management aims to reduce risk as the project progresses so that the end\nproduct of the required standard can be delivered within cost and schedule constraints.\n\n\n\nRELIABILITY/DEPENDABILITY 19.3 613\n\n19.2.5 PA\u2014A project-integrated activity\n\nThe standards of space agencies, procurement agencies and manufacturers are typically\norganized under three main headings\u2014Management, Engineering and Product Assurance\nas illustrated in Table 19.1. Configuration and Data Management , (C & DM) shown in\n\u2018management\u2019, is sometimes included within \u2018product assurance\u2019.\n\nThe separation into three branches can sometimes lead to distorted viewpoints e.g.\nproject managers can think of PA as just a layer of expense on top of the project, and\ntreat it as an overhead like, say, a legal department, using this viewpoint to squeeze the\nPA budget. It can be difficult to \u2018sell\u2019 the concept of \u2018removal of potential problems\u2019 as a\nvaluable contributor to the project. In fact, PA is very much a project-integrated activity\nas depicted in Figure 19.2.\n\n19.3 RELIABILITY/DEPENDABILITY\n\n19.3.1 Basics\n\nEstablished over many decades, the term Reliability was used to describe and include\nall the performance attributes that customers wanted in a product. Reliability engineering\nbecame the engineering discipline that ensured those attributes were designed-in, built-in\n\nCONTRACT\nCOST and\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nProgram Monitoring\nand\n\nResource usage \n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nQuality Assurance, Inspection,\nPreferred Parts & Materials,\n\nprocess control\n\nENGINEERING\n\nDesign and\nManufacture\n\nof the\nspace product\n\nReliability,\nTesting\n\nStandards\n Accounting\n\nWaivers,\n  Problems,\n     Deviations\n          NCRs \n\nBaselines,\nMilestones,\nDeliverables\n\nCurrent\nconfiguration\nand status \n\nC & DM\nDocumentation,\nItem ID, Status\nReconciliation C & DM:  Configuration and\n\ndata management\nNCR:    NonConformance Report\n\nClass II\nChanges\n\nClass I\nChanges\n\nFigure 19.2 Product Assurance in a project context\n\n\n\n614 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nand verified in the product delivered to the customer. Reliability engineers have always\nworked to achieve a high probability of delivering the mission products, have ensured that\nfailures could be tolerated or recovered from, and have provided safe modes to prevent\nthe complete loss of the spacecraft.\n\nThe term Dependability came into common usage because additional attributes (beyond\nthose covered by reliability) became desirable and required by customers. These addi-\ntional requirements included high Availability, Maintainability and Security (immunity\nfrom interference). Dependability has now become the accepted term that covers both\nReliability, and these additional customer requirements.\n\nDependability (definition [4]) The collective term used to describe the availability per-\nformance and its influencing factors: reliability performance, maintainability performance\nand maintainability support performance. Note that dependability is used only for general\ndescriptions in non-quantitative terms.\n\nCommon terms in continued use include:\n\nQualitative Reliability (definition)\u2014 The ability of an item to perform a required func-\ntion under stated conditions for a specified period of time.\n\nQuantitative Reliability (definition)\u2014 The probability that an item will perform a\nrequired function under given conditions for a given time interval (equivalent to\nnumerical reliability).\n\nDesign Reliability or Predicted Reliability (definition)\u2014 The predicted quantitative reli-\nability arrived at during design, using approved input data on failure rates and design\nimplementation (this process assumes that the ground control is 100% perfect and\nthat the spacecraft is exactly as designed)\n\nOperational Reliability (definition)\u2014 The quantitative reliability achievable or achieved\nin-orbit, inclusive of any unpredicted or imperfect behaviour and response to it.\n\nHaving synthesized a design, designers analyse it to demonstrate that it will satisfy input\nrequirements on performance, mass, stability, launcher fairing envelope etc. Reliability\nengineers analyse the design to demonstrate that it will satisfy input requirements on mis-\nsion lifetime, recoverability from anomalies and removal of Single Point Failures (SPF).\nSometimes, reliability engineers also trace possible failure cases back to cause(s)\u2014when\nneeded as an input by the operations team.\n\n19.3.2 Related topics\n\nClosely associated with reliability are other terms as mentioned above, namely availability,\nmaintainability and security. Note that various alternative terms are used for \u2018Security\u2019.\nServiceability, Survivability, Safety can be used in this context by different authors in\ndifferent countries; civilian/military sources can use differing terminology even within a\nparticular country.\n\nAvailability (definition)\u2014 The ability of item to be in a state to perform a required\nfunction under given conditions at a specified instant of time.\n\nThis definition describes an instantaneous form of availability. In most specifications,\navailability is more often required as an overall availability throughout the mission life-\ntime. To respond to this, the analyst integrates the instantaneous form of availability\n\n\n\nRELIABILITY/DEPENDABILITY 19.3 615\n\ndefined above over the mission duration. To perform such an integration, assumptions\nmust be made about outage likelihood and duration. These can, in themselves, become\nspecial topics of investigation in probabilistic models.\n\nMaintainability (definition)\u2014 The ability of an item to be maintained in, or restored to,\na state in which it can perform a required function, when maintenance is performed\nunder given conditions and using stated procedures and resources.\n\nMaintenance applies to spacecraft that are retrievable, and later refurbished and\nre-launched. It also applies to missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). The pre-planned, on-board redundant units included\nin unmanned spacecraft are usually covered by reliability activities.\n\nSecurity (definition)\u2014 The ability of an item to resist interference from intended or\nunintended external influences and remain functioning as required under the control\nof the designated control authority. Note that interference can refer to many kinds\nof external influence, such as meteor or debris impact, physical attack, unauthorized\ntelecommanding, signal-jamming, misappropriation of mission products, and so on.\n\n19.3.3 Reliability theory\n\nThe predicted or design reliability is obtained from a reliability model of the spacecraft,\ndeveloped using series chains of essential hardware/functional elements and parallel ele-\nments where sparing or redundancy exists. These models are known as reliability block\ndiagrams, an example of which is shown in Figure 19.3.\n\nIn this illustration, all four elements are needed for the device to function. Two-for-one\n(2/1) redundancy exists at Element 3. Either 1A & 2A or 1B & 2B (or both) are needed,\nbut (for example) 1A and 2B alone do not connect the chain. Element 4 is always needed\nto ensure function. In this example, individual reliabilities are known inputs to the model.\nMore usually, each \u2018box\u2019 is made up of parts whose failure rates are known, and the\nreliability is computed from them.\n\nFailure Rate (definition)\u2014The expected number of failures of like devices in a given\nenvironment that would occur in a particular time [1] interval. The units of failure\nrate are fits: failures in 109 hours.[2]\n\n[1]Other life exposure measures can also be used such as full cycles, duty cycles or actuations.\n[2]This very large number of hours is chosen to encourage failure rates in integer values only.\n\n2A 3A\n\n4\n\n3B2B1B\n\n1A\n\nElement 1 Element 2 Element 3 Element 4\n\nFigure 19.3 Example of reliability block diagram\n\n\n\n616 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nElectronic Device   l vs. time\n\nI II III\n\nMechanical Device   ? vs. time\n\nI II III\n\nDe-Bugging Useful Life Wear-out De-bugging Work Wear-out\n\nTime ? Operating Life Time ? Operating Life\n\nl l\n\nFigure 19.4 Part type failure rate variation with time\n\nAlthough simply defined, the failure rate of any particular device is not fixed, but varies\nwith time, with stress and with environment. Figure 19.4 illustrates a typical variation of\nfailure rate with time. These shapes are sometimes referred to as bathtub curves. Here ?\ndenotes the failure rate.\n\nFor electronic parts, the constant failure rate regime is targeted to get the desired low,\nsustained values. The wear-out regime occurs when continuing physical and chemical\nprocesses have advanced enough to fail the part. For mechanical parts, the duration of\nthe \u2018work\u2019 section of the curve is shorter, relatively speaking, but still useful. Wear-out\nis just that\u2014surfaces suffer from wear and eventually lead to device failure. Variation\nof failure rate with stress and environment is also an aspect that the designers as well as\nparts procurement professionals must take into account, as:\n\n\u2014 failure rates begin to rise well inside the part manufacturer\u2019s rated maxima,\n\u2014 high temperatures increase failure rates (Arrhenius\u2019s Law quantifies this),\n\u2014 low temperatures increase failure rates,\n\u2014 incident radiation increases failure rates.\n\nDerating, good thermal control, use of radiation-hardened (rad-hard ) parts and physical\nscreening all help to reduce these adverse effects.\n\nAfter any weak parts have been screened out, the failure rate, as it is defined and\nillustrated above, is more-or-less constant during the operational working life. This means\nthat during each equal time-interval, a fixed fraction of such parts fail. The reliability, R,\nor probability of successfully functioning through the required life span T, is then related\nto the failure rate ? as follows:\n\nR = exp(??T )\n\nConsider an example in which a \u2018box\u2019 is made up of n1 type 1 parts with failure rate ?1,\nn2 type 2 parts with failure rate ?2, and so on. For the \u2018box\u2019 to perform successfully during\nthe required life T, all parts within the \u2018box\u2019 must perform successfully. The composite\nreliability of the box is the product of all the reliabilities of the individual parts, so that\n\nRtype1 = exp(??1T )exp(??1T ) . . . . . . exp(??1T ), n1 times,\nRtype2 = exp(??2T )exp(??2T ) . . . . . . exp(??2T ), n2 times,\n\n. . .and so on.\n\n\n\nRELIABILITY/DEPENDABILITY 19.3 617\n\nThe total reliability is then given by\n\nRtotal = Rtype1 Rtype2 Rtype3 . . .\n\nNote that Rtotal is a product of simple exponential functions, so that the arguments or\nindices add up to form a single \u2018exp\u2019 function with a composite argument as follows:\n\nRtotal = exp(?(n1?1 + n2?2 + . . . .)T ) = exp(??totalT).\n\nAdding the indices in this way to obtain ?total is known as the parts count method .\nWhere a constant failure rate is not applicable, several other distributions are available\n\nto match the known reliability characteristics of the part, in particular normal, lognormal\nor gamma-function distributions. Where a very unusual reliability characteristic is needed\nto match a part, the use of the Weibull distribution may be considered. This distribution\nrelies on the exponential function as a base with three shape parameters ? , ? , ? to enable\na good fit to characteristics. The Weibull distribution is expressed as\n\nR = exp[?{(T ? ? )? }? ].\n\nReferring again to Figure 19.3, and using ?## as the applicable box failure rates, we find\nthe reliability of the device for a life span of T, to be given by\n\nRdevice = {1 ? (1 ? exp[??1AT ]exp[??2AT ])\n\u00d7(1 ? exp[??1BT ]exp[??2BT ]} 1 & 2 both not failed\n\u00d7(1 ? exp[??3AT ]exp[??3BT ]) 3A & 3B both not failed\n\u00d7 exp[??4T ] 4 must work(= not fail)\n\nThe combining of terms follows standard probability theory, that is, multiplication \u2018\u00d7\u2019 is\nused for both/and ; \u2018+\u2019 for either/or ; \u20181?() \u2019 for not ().\n\n19.3.4 Reliability enhancement\n\nAs part of their objective to \u2018minimize failure probability\u2019, reliability engineers employ\nseveral methods to enhance reliability:\n\nUse of redundancy greatly increases numerical reliability. Say, a piece of equipment\nhas a reliability of 0.9. If an identical equipment is added as a spare, the reliability\nof the pair rises to 0.99 = 1? (1?0.9) (1 ? 0.9) i.e. the probability of both not\nfailing. The gain in reliability is even more, if the partner unit is switched off until\nit is needed. See also Section 19.3.5 for exceptions to this rule.\n\nDesign diversity is the deliberate use of dissimilar units that can each perform the\nsame function. This is a more expensive option than adding one identical unit. This\ndiversity approach is used where the unit may be novel or where the application is\nsafety-critical or even to obtain in-flight qualification of two different units.\n\nEffects limitation is aimed at stopping the propagation of a failure to any related\nfunctional units or to proximate units (in case of overheating). Resettable fuses,\nauto-switching to back-up units, invoking of safe modes and thermal shielding are\nall options available to designers.\n\n\n\n618 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nDerating of parts can reduce their failure rates and so enhance reliability. There are also\nbeneficial side-effects of derating. For example, the reduced failure rates are closer\nto those used in reliability prediction, and so validate the predictions. Also, unwanted\neffects such as overheating are reduced. However, some parts (e.g. microwave field-\neffect transistors (FET)) cannot be derated as they operate successfully only at their\nrated power levels.\n\nRadiation screening is used where certain kinds of electronics are employed. The kinds\nthat are susceptible to radiation damage are complementary metal oxide semiconduc-\ntors (CMOS), on-board processors and random access memories (RAM). Sometimes,\nit is enough to locate the electronics away from the surface of the spacecraft and use\nits exterior as a screen.\n\nHandling/assembly controls are employed throughout manufacturing facilities to avoid\nintroducing incipient damage to parts.\n\nInspection and/or testing of procured parts is a routine activity often referred to as\nIncoming Inspection . Typically, a sample of a batch of procured parts is tested to\nverify function and note whether variation in part-to-part characteristics are within\nallowed tolerances. Most or all may be also visually inspected.\n\nTesting to demonstrate reliability is a very rare activity. The mission lifetimes of space-\ncraft in orbit are often 15\u201320 years and even accelerated life-testing can take an\nextremely long time to prove the necessary reliability. Some suppliers do submit\ntheir products to continuous life-testing as part of their sales promotion. Teldix in\nHeidelberg, Germany, for example, has a momentum wheel rotating in an evacuated\nglass chamber in its reception area. This has been rotating for many years.\n\n19.3.5 Design analysis techniques\n\nThe reliability engineer analyses the design from the perspective of reliability and failure\npotential and relates this to input requirements (usually from a customer). Table 19.2\nidentifies common analysis techniques, and their advantages and drawbacks.\n\nNote that redundant units are usually switched OFF to reduce power consumption\nand increase reliability. Contingency analysis can check the correctness of these kinds\nof decision throughout the spacecraft. For example, consider a receiver which is ON to\nreceive telecommands. If it fails, the FMECA remedy is \u2018switch to redundant receiver\u2019.\nContingency analysis flags up that no command can be received by the spacecraft if\nthe redundant receiver is OFF. The redundant receiver is therefore always ON in hot\nredundancy to the primary receiver. The logic here relies on thinking beyond the point of\nfirst failure (which is often ignored).\n\n19.4 PARTS\n\n19.4.1 Basics\n\nA part is one of the basic elements of a spacecraft. The spacecraft is built up from its\nconstituent parts. At one time, these were thought to be the only items that could fail\u2014a\nview supported by the \u2018parts count method\u2019 for reliability prediction.

Part-related anomalies are now much rarer, but do still occur\u2014for example, in\nhigh-power GHz field-effect transistors (FET), travelling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA),\nand solar cells. Each of these part-types has passed through several technology upgrades\nover the decades. Each new iteration brings with it new types of failure.\n\n19.4.2 Part types\n\nPart (definition)\u2014The lowest level of assembly, beyond which further disassembly irre-\nvocably destroys the item.\n\nParts are sometimes referred to as components although this can cause confusion. In\nthe USA, the term component is used to mean elements assembled from parts. In Europe\nboth terms are in use to mean parts, as defined above.\n\n\n\n620 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nThere are essentially two main categories of part, summarized as:\n\nElectrical, electronic, and\nelectromechanical (EEE)\n\nMechanical\n\nWires, connectors, resistors, capacitors,\ntransistors, integrated circuits,\nopto-couplers, switches, relays, etc.\n\nStructural elements, honeycomb floors, thrust\ntubes, solar array substrates, antenna\nfixings, etc.\n\n19.4.3 Failures in parts\n\nJust as in reliability studies, parts experts look at failed parts and try to understand how\nand why they failed. From this information, they establish controls aimed at preventing\neach kind of failure. Some typical part failure problems are categorized in Tables 19.3\nand 19.4.\n\nSome of the drivers that provoke failures of parts in orbit are summarized in Table 19.5.\n\n19.4.4 Parts procurement and controls\n\nThe earlier approach of using mostly Hi-Rel or MIL-STD , or alternative specialist pro-\nduction line parts has become impossible to sustain for a number of reasons:\n\n\u2022 rising costs vs. commercial competition pressures,\n\u2022 lack of Hi-Rel production lines,\n\u2022 availability of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts\u2014acceptable for space use.\n\u2022 availability of Civil Avionic/Military (CAM) standard parts.\n\nIt is now common for spacecraft to be built using some COTS and CAM parts where the\nsources are known to produce a stable quality of parts, and these parts have been assessed\n\nTable 19.3 Typical part failure problems\n\nPart types Problems encountered\n\nPassive parts\nFuses Metal crystallizes; in-vacuo behaviour differs; rating error.\nResistors Residual solder flux; surface cracks ? leak paths.\nCapacitors Electrolyte leak; non-polar ? polar; contamination ? resistive\n\nreactance ?.\nActive parts\n\nRF power transistor Local thin metallization ? metal transport with power on.\nIC passivation layer Local thinning ? electrical short through passivation.\nTransistor lead bond Current spike to make bond ? eutectic alloy spread-out.\nProcessors and RAM Cosmic rays ?

Even so, great care is taken to ensure that\nall the parts that are procured are of the required quality. Various procurement systems\nfor ordering parts of the appropriate quality exist and these detail the kinds of tests and\ntolerances that the parts must satisfy. Buyers maintain their own systems for these, often\nrelying on the standards of NASA, ESA, CNES, JAXA and RKA for guidance. However,\ncaution is needed, as summarized in the following principle:\n\nG.P.5\u2014Parts procurement standards are not all interchangeable country-to-country.\n\nExamples of different quality levels at which parts can be procured are shown in\nTable 19.6. Note that reliability engineers also use quality factors to adjust the part\nfailure rates used in reliability predictions.\n\n\n\n622 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nTable 19.6 Parts/components procurement levels\n\nProcurement system Quality level Quality factor\n\nESCC[1] Level B 1\nESCC[1] Level C 2\nER-MIL[2] FR Level S 1\nER-MIL[2] FR Level R 2\nMIL-S-19500 Jan S 1\nMIL-S-19500 Jan TXV 2\nMIL-M-38510 Class S 1\nMIL-M-38510 Class B 2\n\n[1]European Space Components Coordination\n[2]Established Reliability MIL\n\nGiven the size and application of a spacecraft, an internal parts procurement authority\n(or external buying agency) can list the types and quantities of about 60% of parts needed\nand source them.\n\nThe spacecraft project approach is guided by the Parts Procurement Manager. Early on,\nthis manager establishes a Preferred Parts List (PPL) for the project. Generally, all parts\non the list are qualified for space use or are qualifiable as COTS or CAM. The engineers\nresponsible for design and manufacture match their needs to the PPL as far as possible. As\na result, they identify further parts that they need which are not yet included on the PPL.\n\nFollowing this \u2018mismatch\u2019 there follows a period of negotiation, mainly focused on\nwhich of these (many) further parts can be qualified within an acceptable cost and time-\nframe. Sometimes, the qualification is simply an extension of an existing qualification to\na new application or different temperature envelope. In such cases, a delta-qualification\nis carried out to establish the acceptability of the part in its new application/environment.\nOccasionally, a complete program of qualification for the required part is undertaken.\nThis can be very expensive, and often the cost has to be shared between two or more\nprojects. This cost-sharing does take place when an upgrade to an equipment/subsystem\nis being introduced, and the upgrade costs can be amortized over succeeding spacecraft\nin an existing production line.\n\nOne very important duty of the parts procurement manager is to identify the parts that\nmust be ordered well in advance\u2014so-called long-lead parts. This is also co-ordinated\nwith other long-lead items (not necessarily parts).\n\nUltimately, there is a de-facto parts list for the project, to which the following principle\napplies:\n\nG .P .6\u2014All parts/items to be used in a flight spacecraft must be qualified.\n\n19.5 MATERIALS AND PROCESSES\n\n19.5.1 Basics\n\nMaterials, and the processes that modify them, result in basic elements of the spacecraft\nthat are not EEE parts. They can be finished mechanical parts such as structural elements\n\n\n\nMATERIALS AND PROCESSES 19.5 623\n\nTable 19.7 Material functional properties and constraints\n\nFunctional properties Constraints\n\nCommon constraints\nStrength Outgassing\nAdhesion Radiation resistance\nElastic moduli Inertness\nThermal stability Reproducibility\nDuctile properties Tolerance to processing\nMalleability Matching coefficients of expansion\nCuttable without shatter Man-rated constraints\nReflectivity Low toxicity\nAbsorptivity/transmittance Low odour\nEnergy content: Non-flammable\n\n-propellant, electrolyte, springs Low outgassing/offgassing\n\nor a means of holding other elements together, such as adhesive tape, fixings, solder or\npotting compound.\n\nSelection, processing and application of materials requires just as much care as does\nthe procurement and application control of parts.\n\n19.5.2 Properties of materials\n\nTable 19.7 lists the main properties of materials that are of special importance to their\nuse in spacecraft.\n\nOutgassing of materials is a problem that is particular to space applications (see also\nChapter 2). When materials are removed from air and placed in a vacuum chamber, the\nmaterial loses mass. This can result in significant changes to its properties, and the release\nof volatile condensable materials (which can disable optical devices).\n\nMaterials for space use are subject to initial screening that requires their mass-loss\nin vacuum to be no greater than 1%, and the Collected Volatile Condensable Materials\n(CVCM) to be no greater than 0.1%. This CVCM constraint refers to the material emitted\nfrom a sample at +125?C and collected on a surface at +25?C over a 24 hour period.\n\n19.5.3 Applications and processing\n\nThere is a large volume of data stored by manufacturers of equipments and whole space-\ncraft. National agencies also hold considerable data on materials that are mostly available\nto spacecraft builders. As with parts, there is usually a project specialist Materials and\nProcesses engineer who negotiates with the design and production engineers concerning\nwhich materials can be used in which applications.\n\nExperience obtained over many years has led to the prohibition of certain materials from\nuse in spacecraft manufacture. This accrued wisdom does not completely exclude the use\nof such materials, but a very strong case and special assessments have to be made where\ntheir use is unavoidable. Examples of such prohibited materials are given in Table 19.8.\n\n\n\n624 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nTable 19.8 Prohibited materials and materials to be avoided\n\nMaterial Type of problem\n\nFlexible adhesives Loses elasticity; fractures when solidified\nPolyvinyl chloride backing tapes Unstable properties\nCellulose, paper, fabrics, etc Unstable properties\nVarnishes and coatings which rely on\n\nsolvent evaporation for hardening\nProperties change in vacuum and with temperature\n\ncycling\nCanada balsam; organic glasses in high\n\nprecision equipment\nUnstable\n\nMost oils and greases Material migration\nGraphite Abrasive in vacuum\nCadmium, zinc and tin Dendrite growth; risk of shorting\nMost paints Outgassing unstable properties\nPolyvinyl chloride, cellulose and\n\nacetates, Plastic film\nUnstable properties\n\nPotting Fracture at temperature extremes\nPolyester laminates Unstable properties\nRubbers using poly-sulfides; plasticizers;\n\nchlorinated\nUnstable properties\n\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) thermoplastic;\npolyvinyl acetate; butyrate; several\npolyamides\n\nUnstable properties\n\nNote also that some materials that are accepted for use in space require special attention\nwhen being processed into their final state. Typical examples are soldering and specialist\nmachining of metals. Beryllium produces poisonous oxide when machined.\n\n19.5.4 Materials problems\n\nTable 19.9 describes some typical problems with materials that have been encountered\nin past missions. The experience gained through these occurrences have led to further\nprinciples and the reinforcement of existing principles.\n\nThe main principles in materials and processes engineering are:\n\nG .P .7\u2014\u2018Cleanliness is next to Godliness\u2019 in space engineering.\nG .P .8\u2014The processes and application are just as important as the material.\nG .P .9\u2014The only guarantee of quality from a supplier is exact repeatability.\n\n19.5.5 Special case: materials problems in parts\n\nThe materials used in the fabric of parts have the potential to produce yet further problems.\nSome examples are outlined in Table 19.10.\n\n\n\nMATERIALS AND PROCESSES 19.5 625\n\nTable 19.9 Examples of material problems that occurred in orbit\n\nSpace Shuttle\nthermal tiles\n\nThe Space Shuttle has over 24 000 tiles, each with a different shape\u2014an\nextreme configuration management problem. Early launches lost tiles\nduring ascent and re-entry. An extra layer of bonding was required.\nThis added to weight and thus reduced payload capability.\n\nAtomic gas Cleaning fluid can leave traces of contaminant on surfaces. The space\nenvironment encourages the release of atomic hydrogen, which\ndisrupts the molecular lattice. The effect shows as embrittlement in\nmetals. This can lead to fracture, and can result in a catastrophic\nfailure in springs.\n\nGrowth of\ndendrites\n\nCadmium, zinc and tin have all exhibited dendrite (whisker) growth at\ncorner sites when in the presence of an impurity and/or an electric\nfield. This can lead to short circuits.\n\nGOES lamps Specialist lamps of an exact light frequency were used on a series of\nGOES satellites. The first lamps were successful. Later lamps failed\nin orbit before end of duty life. Part way through the production\ncycle, the lamp manufacturer had changed the supplier of the filament\nmaterial for the lamps. The newly supplied raw material was of a\ndifferent composition and its life characteristics had not been checked\nfor application in the space environment.\n\nTable 19.10 Examples of materials problems within parts\n\nDendrite growth in\ndigital integrated\ncircuits\n\nTemperature + electrical bias + moisture = dendrites. These\nneedle-like growths (of molybdenum) occur at corner sites in\nmetal/substrate interfaces. They can lead to cross-track shorts\nand capacity changes\u2014important in some part types.\n\nGalvanic corrosion Dissimilar metals + moisture + warmth = voltage couple. The\nmoisture passes through plating and forms an electrolyte. The\nsustained emf causes corrosion.\n\nStress corrosion Mechanical stress opens tiny fissures in material. Fissures form\nsites where impurities can gather and leave material without its\nprotective coating at these sites.\n\nConstituents have\nunmatched coefficients\nof expansion\n\nLarge temperature excursions\u2014in/out of eclipses\u2014generate\nsevere strains within the part that can lead either to fracture or\nunstable electrical behaviour.\n\n19.5.6 Materials program\n\nMaterials are purchased in a highly controlled way and share many practices with parts\nprocurement. The sources are pre-approved to produce materials of the space-acceptable\nquality required. Each delivery of materials is inspected and checked for the slightest\nchange from previous deliveries, is logged, dated and source-identified in inventory. For\n\n\n\n626 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\na spacecraft production line, the required materials are purchased in bulk\u2014this implies\nthat the storage environment must be highly controlled to maintain the material in good\ncondition and uncontaminated. See also Traceability in Section 19.6.\n\nThe spacecraft project approach is conducted by the Materials and Processes Manager.\nEarly on, this manager sets up a Preferred Materials List (PML) for the project. Generally,\nall materials on the PML are qualified for applications in space when processed using\napproved methods. The engineers responsible for design and manufacture attempt to\nensure that their needs correspond with the PML. However, occasionally they will identify\nfurther materials that are required which are not yet included on the PML.\n\nFollowing this disparity there follows a period of discussion, considering which of\nthese further materials can be qualified within an acceptable cost and time. Occasionally,\nthe designers can be persuaded to adopt an existing preferred material already on the\nPML. Sometimes, the qualification is just an extension of an existing qualification to a\nslightly different application or thermal environment. In such cases, and similar to the\nprocedure adopted in dealing with parts, a delta-qualification is performed to establish the\nacceptability of the material in its new application/environment. Occasionally, a complete\nprogram of qualification for the required material is necessary. This can be required for,\nsay, a scientific spacecraft where a payload instrument relies on a particular component to\nfunction, and this component includes materials that are not yet qualified. Such qualifica-\ntion can be very expensive, requiring specialist laboratory equipment, vacuum chambers\nand time and effort. It can be difficult to share the cost between two or more projects,\nwhere only one is ever likely to need the component. However cost-sharing does take\nplace when an upgrade to an equipment/subsystem is being introduced, and the upgrade\ncosts can be amortized over succeeding spacecraft in an existing production line.\n\nThe materials and processes manager has to identify the materials that must be ordered\nwell in advance\u2014so-called long-lead items. This early-ordering is also co-ordinated with\nother long-lead procurements.\n\nUltimately, there is effectively a materials, processes and application list for the project.\n\n19.6 PRODUCT ASSURANCE IN MANUFACTURING, AI&V\n\n19.6.1 Basics\n\nThis phase comprises Manufacturing, Assembly, Integration and Verification (AI&V).\nThe product assurance effort in this phase is often called Quality Assurance (QA). When\nquality was a term referring only or mainly to the build standard of the delivered product,\nthis was very appropriate. If the product failed, it was called unreliable, or broken, but\nrarely was it referred to as of poor quality. In the ISO 9000 series standards and widely\nin the assurance sector, quality now means the \u2018totality of features or characteristics that\nbear on its ability. . .etc.\u2019 (see definition in Subsection 19.2.2). This implies that quality\nincludes most, if not all of the assurance topics. Even so, Quality Assurance is still a\nwidely used term and it is employed here. The sense in which the term QA is used here\nis summarized by the following:\n\n\u2022 QA is mainly focused on manufacturing/test,\n\u2022 QA reach extends back into design,\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE IN MANUFACTURING, AI&V 19.6 627\n\n\u2022 QA reach extends forward into deployment and use,\n\u2022 QA role is monitoring, audit and verification,\n\u2022 QA activity contributes to the evidence of quality required by the customer.\n\nThe main activities involved in the QA process are given in Table 19.11, and these are\nbriefly described in the subsections below.\n\nIn Section 19.2.1 the so-called \u2018Murphy\u2019s Law\u2019 was stated\u2014\u2018If anything can go wrong,\nit will go wrong.\u2019 A good way to think of QA is to imagine all the possible ways that\na particular task might be performed wrongly, and ask what intervention or extra check\ncould be made to prevent this. QA is largely a considered response to G .P .2.\n\n19.6.2 Process controls and records\n\nAll routine processes and all critical processes must be properly understood and carried\nout to an acceptable and approved standard (otherwise it is possible for someone to omit\nthem or perform them wrongly).\n\nThis implies that they must all be fully documented, which includes\u2014preparation;\nresources required; method of execution and witnesses if necessary. In particular cases,\nit will be necessary to rehearse and exercise the processes to show correct and consistent\nresults. The controls used must be concise and clear enough that they can be signed off\nby the responsible PA officer and engineering staff.\n\n19.6.3 Training and certification\n\nAll persons must have adequate qualifications and experience. Note that it is not only\nqualifications that are required. Proficiency is the objective. Whenever a new or modi-\nfied activity has to be accomplished, (re)training is mandatory for the operative who is\n\nTable 19.11 Main Quality Assurance disciplines\n\n1.

Qualification and acceptance\n\n\n\n628 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nto perform the task. The training must itself meet standards, and be delivered only by\nexperienced and approved educators. Those executing critical processes must:\n\n\u2022 have demonstrated proficiency,\n\u2022 hold a certificate signed by an authority to show proficiency,\n\u2022 receive regular checks and training updates.\n\n19.6.4 Traceability\n\nThere are three main kinds of Traceability in a space project\u2014the ability to:\n\n\u2022 trace use of tools/measuring devices/test equipment (see Subsection 19.6.5),\n\u2022 trace any part or material back to its original procurement and supplier,\n\u2022 trace any part or material to where it is used. This is helpful when whole batch\n\nproblems occur\u2014as when an alert is received (see Subsection 19.6.7).\n\n19.6.5 Metrology and calibration\n\nIt is quite easy for an engineer to use a test instrument to take a reading, even obtaining\nan automated print-out. Such readings (particularly if they meet the specification) acquire\ngreat significance. However, what is not so obvious is whether the test instrument gives\na genuine reading. Regular calibration of all measurement devices and instrumentation is\nessential good practice.\n\nThe magnitude of errors (in tools and instruments) must be known. The total error in\nthe worst case includes:\n\n\u2022 the error of the calibration process,\n\u2022 the error in the calibration standard,\n\u2022 the error in the user reading of the tool or instrument.\n\nRecall that all outputs should be produced to a repeatable baseline. Therefore, all the\nchecks in aggregate should be sufficient\u2014if they indicate a pass, the device is acceptable.\nVery rarely, the production of devices is so difficult that the produced items are not\nconsistent. In these cases, just the best (on test, or on measurement) must be selected for\nuse in the flight spacecraft. Whilst the metrology may be good, this is poor engineering\npractice. In these cases, the baseline is not repeatable.\n\n19.6.6 Non-conformances control\n\nIt is a customer requirement that a manufacturer/supplier has a system in place for detect-\ning, recording, assessing and processing, to a satisfactory conclusion, all non-conforming\nmaterial. Non-conformances can arise from an inspection, test outcome, failure to cali-\nbrate, contract error, or a design review (action item). Every non-conformance is recorded\nin a Non-Conformance Report (NCR). It is the responsibility of the Material Review Board\n(MRB ) to see through the processing of the non-conformance to its conclusion. Table 19.12\nillustrates this processing scheme. The NCR is first categorized according to its severity\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE IN MANUFACTURING, AI&V 19.6 629\n\nTable 19.12 Non-conformance NCR processing scheme\n\nArea Classification Description Re-test Notify Buyer\n(acronym) and buyer action\n\ncheck needed\n\n(NCR) Non-conformance found and Report\nissued with unique ID.\n\n(MRB) Material Review Board con venes;\nassesses significance of NCR\n\nYes[1]\n\nMinor Disposition locally\n\nSe\nve\n\nri\nty\n\nMajor Serious. Involve customer at once Yes Yes\n\n(RFW) Request for Waiver of requirement\nthat cannot be satisfied.\n\nYes Yes\n\n(RFD) Request for Deviation from\nspecification of an in-work end-item\n\nYes Yes\n\nC\non\n\nce\nss\n\nio\nn\n\nNone Concession not needed\n\nUse-as-is Correction of no benefit and no\nvalue.

A decision is made as to whether the customer\nshould be asked for a Concession (to waive a requirement, or allow a manufactured item\nto deviate from a specification). Finally, the appropriate action (one of a limited number\nof possibilities) is taken. This is referred to as a Disposition.\n\n19.6.7 Alerts\n\nAlerts deal with \u2018found\u2019 problems, mainly with a part or material from a known supplier.\nMost space communities have a knowledge-pooling facility to notify others of problems\nthat have been encountered with a supplier. ESA and CNES have alert systems in use,\nas do their counterparts in North America. The purpose of an alert is to disseminate to\nthe wider user community any adverse experience of a particular batch of parts or batch\nof material.\n\nThe Traceability functions (see Subsection 19.6.4) are particularly helpful, as they\nspeed up the search for the suspect items. The purchasing records can quickly determine\n\n\n\n630 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nwhether or not the suspect parts or materials have been purchased. Similarly, the \u2018where\nused\u2019 records will identify if any remedial work is needed on flight hardware. Retrofitting\nnew elements is something to be avoided wherever possible as it may require repetition\nof earlier testing\u2014at a cost.\n\n19.6.8 Preservation, Packaging, Handling, Storage\n\nand Shipping (PPHSS)\n\nPPHSS is collectively about environmental controls to prevent damage to the spacecraft,\nor indeed to any bought-in finished units. The general requirements are as follows:\n\n\u2022 packing materials must be inert with respect to the packed item,\n\u2022 containers must be fitted with environmental sensors to monitor temperature, pres-\n\nsure, humidity, shock, and vibration,\n\u2022 handling must be non-injurious to humans, and non-damaging to the spacecraft,\n\u2022 shipping (transportation) must meet the collective requirements[1] of the owner,\n\nsender/conveyor and recipient,\n\u2022 the storage environment must \u2018preserve\u2019. In practice this usually means the use of\n\nan atmosphere of dry nitrogen (or similar) and temperature control. Batteries are not\nusually fitted to a stored spacecraft.\n[1]Some spacecraft conveyed by aircraft are now sent fully fuelled\n\n19.6.9 Trends and statistics\n\nMonitoring of trends and statistics over time can be of significant help to the QA team.\nTypical data worth monitoring are:\n\n\u2022 inspection accept/reject statistics, with special note taken of rising numbers of rejects\nper inspection,\n\n\u2022 NCR occurrence profile with time. A rise in such occurrences should be expected,\nfollowed by a sustained fall,\n\n\u2022 NCR disposition statistics, being alert to excessive reworks or excessive scrap.\nTrends and statistics can also be used to:\n\n\u2022 give early warning of a developing process problem,\n\u2022 initiate a problem diagnosis,\n\u2022 monitor PA effectiveness,\n\u2022 improve PA cost-effectiveness.\n\n19.6.10 Design margins verification\n\nAll designers synthesize designs which will meet the requirements of:\n\n\u2022 Form: e.g. cuboid with light metal casing,\n\u2022 Fit: mechanical interfaces; electrical power, electrical signal interfaces,\n\u2022 Function: all inputs generate required outputs,\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE IN MANUFACTURING, AI&V 19.6 631\n\nThe launch phase and space environment also present challenges to designers, so their\ndesigns must also meet these requirements:\n\n\u2022 Environment: operation in thermal environment, vacuum, acceleration, vibration,\nshock, etc.\n\nAnalyses of the designs are made to demonstrate that these requirements are met.\nDuring the Manufacture and AI&V phases, the as-built designs undergo tests to show\nthat they do indeed meet these requirements. The designer generally wants to avoid any\nfailure in testing of the as-built design. To ensure this success in testing, the designer will\nslightly over-design the device. This is common in most branches of engineering where\nfailures in service can ruin the reputation of a device manufacturer. On the other hand,\nextreme over-design can result in unmanageable costs. The space engineering community\nhas established various levels of design robustness that enable devices to reach orbit in\ngood condition and function in-service for long periods.\n\nThe project Parts, Materials/Processes and Applications will all be qualified for the\nflight spacecraft (recall G .P .6, that all parts/items to be used in a flight spacecraft must\nbe qualified). In this phase, it is the assemblies, equipments, subsystems and the whole\nspacecraft that are qualified.\n\nWhatever level of assembly is being performed, there are predicted stress exposures\nfor the device. The designer\u2019s planning for the various levels of exposure are based on\nthe following environmental load levels:\n\n\u2022 the Expected levels: stress ranges predicted by analysis,\n\u2022 the Acceptance levels: just beyond worst case expected,\n\u2022 the Qualification levels: proof of a Margin beyond Acceptance,\n\u2022 the Design Point: just beyond Qualification level (to avoid failure in test).\n\nTypically, thermal Acceptance levels are +/?5?C beyond worst case expected and\nare applied for a known duration that will not over-expose the device to energy input.\nQualification levels can be up to +/?10?C beyond worst case expected and last rather\nlonger than Acceptance level tests (see also Chapter 11) There are also defined threshold\nlevels for vibration and shock stresses at Acceptance, Qualification etc.\n\n\u2018Qualification Models\u2019 are those devices subjected to these Qualification-level and dura-\ntion tests. They are usually not used in flight spacecraft. Spacecraft Qualification Models\nare hardly ever made currently because of cost, but occasionally, a planned series of\nmilitary satellites will be preceded by a Qualification Model spacecraft\n\n\u2018ProtoFlight Models\u2019 represent a compromise between meeting the proof-of-margin\nqualification requirement and limitation of energy input. Such Protoflight Models\nare devices subjected to Qualification Level Tests for Acceptance Duration (see also\nChapter 17).\n\nThe general principle is to avoid damaging the test article by limiting the total energy\ninput of all testing. It is therefore very important to log all test exposures of devices.\nThese test exposure logs also form part of the quality evidence the customer requires.\n\nG .P .7\u2014Log all test exposures (levels, durations, environment) and limit total energy\ninput.\n\n\n\n632 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nWhatever the level of assembly, the ultimate aim is to have the flight items\nqualified. The status of \u2018Qualified for flight\u2019 is achieved through the controls over parts,\nmaterials/processes and applications during build, and testing to demonstrate performance\nand margins in simulated space environments. Once a device has flown successfully,\nit is referred to as \u2018Flight Qualified\u2019 but only to the extent of its \u2018Qualification\nEnvelope\u2019\u2014temperature range, maximum vibration, shock, acceleration, and so on.\n\nQualification is achieved by one of two main methods:\n\n\u2022 similarity: comparison with like, qualified, items,\n\u2022 testing: environmental exposure (thermal vacuum, vibration table).\n\n\u2018Qualification by Similarity\u2019 is becoming progressively more common, especially where\nCOTS and CAM devices are adopted. However, failures in-orbit are often attributable to\nqualification by similarity that is poorly done, which is referred to as \u2018Flawed Qualification\nby Similarity\u2019.\n\n19.6.11 Procurement controls\n\nThis is a specialist domain (see Parts, Materials). Procurement Documents must define:\n\n\u2022 item, quality, quantity and receive inspection/checks,\n\u2022 accept/reject criteria and supplier approval status.\n\nProcurement planning must take account of:\n\n\u2022 contractual documentation of space vehicle,\n\u2022 lead times and contingency plans,\n\u2022 suitable storage of bought items.\n\n19.6.12 Control of changes\n\nControl of changes is a critically important activity for several reasons:\n\n\u2022 it ensures that all changes are properly examined by someone other than the proposer\nof the change,\n\n\u2022 all changes are authorized by a senior project officer,\n\u2022 approved changes are disseminated to all project team members,\n\u2022 all project team members work to the same baseline.\n\nChanges begin in a variety of ways, for example, with a rejection by an inspector,\na Failure Review Board (FRB), a Test Review Board (TRB), a Material Review Board\n(MRB), a Non-Conformance Report (NCR), or a contract error. If the appropriate action\nis a change, then a change proposal/request, with justification, is compiled and issued for\ndiscussion. In some contracts, a change notification is originated by the customer and a\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE IN MANUFACTURING, AI&V 19.6 633\n\nchange request is originated by the manufacturer. In both cases, the change is classified\nin one of two ways:\n\n\u2022 Class I, which has no effect on performance, cost, schedule, interchangeability, or\n\u2022 Class II, which does affect performance, cost, schedule, interchangeability. This clas-\n\nsification always involves the customer in the decision-making process.\n\n19.6.13 Audits and inspections\n\nAudits are made to check the PA systems of subcontractors and suppliers. Audits can\nalso be used to assess a manufacturer\u2019s own PA (self evaluation). The main function\nof the audit is to verify that the PA system does perform properly as presented and\naccepted. Most spacecraft manufacturers have in place an ISO 9000 series accreditation\nthat requires a regular audit of its quality function. Even so, project audits within a contract\nstill take place.\n\nFormal inspections take place to verify the successful completion of a step or stage of\nmanufacture. A successful inspection contributes to the quality evidence that has to be\nmade available to the customer. Inspections must be carried out at every point where:\n\n\u2022 a critical or very difficult process has been completed,\n\u2022 discovery of a failure at a later stage would be costly in time or money,\n\u2022 the customer requires it.\n\nInspections that are not successful must generate a formal NCR.\n\n19.6.14 Qualification and acceptance\n\nAll flight-items must be Qualified for flight. The nearer the launch becomes, the more\npressure grows to sign off the last few unqualified items as \u2018qualified\u2019. The PA manager\nneeds a cool head at this stage. The status \u2018qualified\u2019 must be used extremely carefully.\nItems are designated as \u2018Qualified \u2019 only:\n\n\u2022 for the defined environment (mechanical, thermal, etc),\n\u2022 for the defined application,\n\u2022 when intended use is within the qualified use envelope,\n\u2022 when calculations, tests, part/material sources and processes are all satisfactory,\n\u2022 when testing has demonstrated needed margins.\n\nItems are \u2018Accepted \u2019 for flight use only:\n\n\u2022 when the item is made to the qualified design/build standard,\n\u2022 when all NCRs are properly closed,\n\u2022 when it passes Acceptance Level tests satisfactorily.\n\nProtoFlight is a special case (see Subsection 19.6.10) and is often used at spacecraft\nlevel for the first flight-spacecraft in a series. Later models are simply acceptance tested.\n\n\n\n634 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\n19.7 SAFETY\n\n19.7.1 Basics\n\nThe overall objective of the Safety programme is to prevent accidents and to identify\nand control all hazards or threats to people, the system and the mission. Safety\nrequirements apply to all programme phases; these requirements span ground and\nflight hardware, software and documentation. They also aim to protect people from\n\u2018human-induced\u2019 hazards.\n\nHazard analysis has a general form as exemplified by the following:\n\nHAZARD\n\nFlammable\nmaterial \n\nINITIATOR EVENT\n\nHot-spot caused by a\ntransistor heat sink\n\nCONSEQUENCE\n\nMaterial catches fire &\nproduces smoke that\nthreatens human life\n\nFor unmanned missions, safety is largely a matter of industrial protection and includes\nhandling of toxic fluids, protection against high-voltages and RF supplies, transport\nand storage of flight equipment. Potential for personal injury should not be dismissed\ncompletely\u2014on some occasions, spacecraft have fallen or tipped over in the manufac-\nturer\u2019s factory. Inappropriate usage of high-pressure air hoses has also caused injury\nsevere enough to hospitalize the victim.\n\nFor crewed missions, protection of the crew and accompanying scientists is the main\nobjective. This applies in countdown, during launch, docking, while on station, during\nEVA, undocking, re-entry and landing, and return to ground base station.\n\n19.7.2 Categories of threat to safety\n\nHazards are classified as catastrophic, critical or minor, depending on their consequences,\nas shown in Table 19.13.\n\n19.7.3 Hazard reduction process\n\nOne aspect of safety is to identify hazards\u2014another altogether is how to deal with\nthem. The objective is always hazard reduction, ideally to the point where it can be\neliminated altogether.\n\nThe following Hazard Reduction precedence applies:\n\n1) Eliminate hazard (e.g. remove flammable material).\n2) Design for minimum hazard.\n3) Control hazard (minimizes residual risk):\n\n\u2022 Minimize probability of a hazardous event\n\u2022 Implement devices that warn of such events\n\u2022 Special procedures that must be followed by users to avoid the development of\n\na hazard into an adverse consequence. This means that the hazard and initiating\nevent cannot be eliminated by design.\n\n\n\nSAFETY 19.7 635\n\nTable 19.13 Hazard severity categories\n\nEffect on: Hazard severity categories\n\nI. Catastrophic II. Critical III. Minor\n\nHuman Loss of life; life threatening or\npermanently disabling injury\nor occupational illness\n\nTemporary disabling\ninjury; temporary\noccupational illness\n\nInterfacing\nmanned space\nflight system\n\nLoss of element Loss of or major damage Minor damage\n\nGround facilities Loss of or major damage Minor damage\n\nLaunch site Loss of facilities Minor damage\n\nPublic or private\nproperty\n\nLoss of, or major\ndamage\n\nMinor damage\n\nEnvironment Long-term detrimental effects Short-term detrimental\neffects\n\n19.7.4 Emergency, warning and caution\n\nThese terms relate to threats to human life in crewed missions. Analysis needs to be done\nwhich aims to define the criteria for each such situation, where and when they can occur\nand what must be done to respond to them. This uses inputs from hazard analysis and\nwarning-time analysis, where the latter includes the time interval needed to detect and\nrespond fully to the initiating event.\n\nIt is also now a well established requirement that humans must have a means of escape\nfrom uncontrolled life-threatening situations. In the case of the space shuttle, this was\nnot available in the 1986 Challenger launch disaster, nor was it available in the 2003\nColumbia re-entry accident. It is, however, available on the ISS, which comprises several\ninterconnected modules that can be isolated from each other.\n\nThe outputs of emergency, warning and caution studies include various safing functions\nand safety features that must be included in the design. Some of these are necessary only\nduring certain periods of the mission, but are typically available throughout.\n\nThe emergency, warning, caution and safing function is required to flag hazardous situ-\nations and render them safe. Categories of such situations may be summarized as follows:\n\nEmergencies: potentially catastrophic and/or critical hazardous events\nhave occurred.\n\nWarning situations: potentially catastrophic and/or critical hazardous events\nare imminent.\n\nCaution situations: potentially catastrophic and/or critical hazardous events\nmay occur as a result of a known condition.\n\n\n\n636 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\n19.7.5 Fault tolerance requirements\n\nThere are special criteria and requirements for the mandatory implementation of fault-\ntolerant designs. Single failure criteria can be summarized as:\n\n(a) No single failure shall have a catastrophic or critical hazardous consequence.\n(b) No single operator error shall have a catastrophic or critical hazardous consequence.\n(c) No combination of a single failure and a human operational error shall have a\n\ncatastrophic hazardous consequence.\n\nSome examples of requirements placed upon safety-critical functions and items include:\n\nCompliance with fault tolerance requirements for catastrophes.\nFor software, multiple (> = 2) versions are created by different development\n\nteams\u2014this eliminates systematic errors that could exist in identical software\ninstances. Hardware functional back-up is acceptable if only one software instance\nis available.\n\nParts must be of Quality Level B (best). Generally, COTS and CAM parts are not\nacceptable.\n\nVerification of requirements implementation. This includes verification by test, by\ninspection and by documentation review. All safety requirements must have\na response in the safety analysis, the design documentation and the design\nimplementation in hardware/software/procedures.\n\nFormal acceptance of residual risk.\n\n19.7.6 Comparison of safety and reliability\n\nSafety and Reliability both deal with the causes and consequences of something unex-\npected occurring. Safety deals with protection of personnel and the investment. Relia-\nbility focuses on the success of the mission (as measured by the delivery of intended\nmission products).\n\n19.7.7 Safety is an essential burden\n\nIt should be noted that implementing the safety requirements places a huge additional\nburden on the project. More than any other aspect, protection of human life is regarded\nas the most important issue. The presence of humans in space requires a living\nenvironment, storage of food and water, periodic dependable re-supply and removal of\nwaste products.\n\nIn addition numerous safety features must be included and the spacecraft\u2019s exterior\nsurfaces must be proof against the most likely meteor and debris impact events. All of\nthis adds considerable mass to the orbiting facility, and reduces the volume and mass\navailable for any high-priority payload experiments.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ASSURANCE IN OPERATIONS 19.8 637\n\n19.8 PRODUCT ASSURANCE IN OPERATIONS\n\nIn spacecraft operations, the main objective is to reduce as much as possible any risk to\nthe flow of mission products and/or risk to the spacecraft itself (see also Chapter 14).\n\nOperations Control Centres (OCC) have extensive computing facilities to process\ntelemetry and send telecommands, leased lines to connect to ground stations and direct\ncommunication with those requiring the mission products. OCC personnel also use the\norbit evolution data of the spacecraft under their control in order to plan necessary\norbit-control manoeuvres. The task of controlling the spacecraft is assisted by the\nfollowing common features:\n\n\u2022 Telemetry channels are displayed to facilitate a (selectable) inspection of each area\nof interest such as power, AOCS, TT&C, payload status, and so on. The teleme-\ntry channels show the values of parameters in engineering units when the device\nmonitored is both on and on-line. If it is on, but off-line, the values are often\nsuppressed (but can still be viewed if needed). These values are continuously mon-\nitored and automatically checked against predetermined defined limits. If a limit is\nbreached, an alarm is triggered and the affected channel display changes colour (e.g.\nto red). Both soft and hard limits are often included to help the operations controller\u2019s\ndecision-making process.\n\n\u2022 So called \u2018mode equations\u2019 (using Boolean logic) handle the suppression or the\ndisplay of telemetry channels. These equations also have a protective purpose. Some\ncommands are unsafe to send when the spacecraft is in particular conditions. The\nmode equations prevent the command being sent in these situations. A further alarm\nis generated.\n\n\u2022 There are usually at least two safe-modes on the spacecraft: (a) to permit continuity of\nservice in the face of a failure, and (b) to seek the sun if an encountered failure is too\ndifficult to correct automatically. From each safe mode (a known state), operators\ncan begin recovery of the normal operational status using Contingency Recovery\nProcedures (CRP), bypassing the fault that led to the safe mode.\n\nThe operators are given extensive training in the design of the spacecraft and its foreseen\nbehaviour. There are software simulators for the particular spacecraft, and operators can\npractice Flight Control Procedures (FCP) and Contingency Recovery Procedures (CRP).\nFlight Dynamics experts provide the necessary orbit evolution and manoeuvre plans for\nexecution by the operators.\n\nThe FCPs and CRPs are generated with the objective of avoiding \u2018creative thinking\nunder time-pressure\u2019. Everything is pre-planned, as far as it is possible to be so. Because\nof all the checks and controls that exist in an OCC, it is rare to encounter an operator\nerror that damages the spacecraft. However, sometimes the flow of mission products may\nbe temporarily interrupted by command errors.\n\n\n\n638 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\n19.9 SOFTWARE PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\n19.9.1 Basics\n\nSoftware differs from hardware in several respects:\n\n\u2022 it weighs nothing,\n\u2022 it can be copied multiple times at negligible cost,\n\u2022 it requires a host (a processor and maybe an operating system) to function,\n\u2022 it is very easy to modify,\n\u2022 it is virtually impossible to test thoroughly,\n\u2022 host hardware failure (e.g. through a SEU) can cause software failure, and\n\u2022 if software fails (for any reason), its behaviour and that of the hardware it controls\n\ncan rapidly become chaotic.\n\nTo develop dependable software originating from a new requirement from a user (either\nhuman or other part of a system), controls are needed at all stages of the software cycle.\nSoftware engineering standards (see for example, Reference [5]) typically require a soft-\nware development process which includes the following phases:\n\nUser Requirements Capture,\nSoftware Requirements Definition,\nArchitectural Design,\nSoftware Detailed Design and Production,\nTransfer to Buyer, and\nOperations and Maintenance.\n\nThis method is helpful when completely new software is to be developed. However,\nit is sometimes necessary or desirable to use previously developed/used software. This\ncan be \u2018as is\u2019 in a similar application or with modification/enhancement. When used as\na module in a larger software development, the re-used software module maybe used \u2018as\nis\u2019 or modified. Such re-use is only practical when the software to be re-used has itself\nbeen designed for re-use, and is fully documented.\n\nIn any but the very smallest software development, most organizations that develop\nsoftware have a well-established set of standards to which they work. These include\nextensive Software Engineering standards that deal with modular design, language selec-\ntion, coding, structured programming, object oriented designs verification, validation, and\nso on. These are complemented by Software Product Assurance standards [6] that can\nconveniently be organized by function.\n\n19.9.2 Software PA programme\n\nOrganization and Responsibility , and Software PA programme management activities are\nmainly aimed at ensuring that competent persons are available to undertake the work and\nthat the PA function is properly resourced. For efficiency reasons, the PA experts may\nbe embedded within the development team, but they must be able to both accept, and to\n\n\n\nSOFTWARE PRODUCT ASSURANCE 19.9 639\n\ncriticize/reject. These organization and management responsibilities also deal with regular\nreporting, inspection points, audits, software problem detection, recording and resolution.\n\nRisk management in software development is similar to that function in hardware\ndevelopment, and includes identifying and characterizing risks (to performance, qualifi-\ncation, certification and cost/schedule) and applying effort to eliminate them or to reduce\ntheir significance.\n\nSupplier selection and control can apply to the buyer/customer or to a software contrac-\ntor who is choosing a subcontractor. In both cases, the organization requiring the software\ndevelopment must be satisfied that the contractor has competent staff, that they are avail-\nable for the project and that the necessary PA controls will be in place throughout the\ndevelopment. Where a contractor may be engaging a subcontractor, it is the contractor\u2019s\nduty to ensure that the subcontractor\u2019s standards are at least as good as those required by\nthe end customer.\n\nProcurement controls are aimed mainly at defining exactly what is required,\noptions for extensions/enhancements, acceptance methods and criteria, operations and\nmaintenance support.\n\nTools and supporting environment(s) are essential to any development of software.\nSelection and approval of support tools such as requirements analysers, coding standards\ncheckers, and testing environments are part of the management function for the contract\nitself and within the project.\n\nAssessment and improvement is a process is to be found in any good software contrac-\ntor\u2019s management scheme. Where this is effective and routinely applied throughout the\ncontractor\u2019s organization, this can be used to confirm that the software development project\nitself has such a function. Where it does not form part of the contractor\u2019s management,\nit must be established and PA-monitored for effectiveness.\n\n19.9.3 Software Process Assurance\n\nThe Software Development Life Cycle forms part of the overall life cycle from concept\nto end of application life. Within the development life cycle, the following must be\ndefined: phases, phase input(s) and output(s), completion status, milestones, dependencies,\nresponsibilities and customer action at milestones.\n\nGeneral Software Engineering Requirements are those used for planning of devel-\nopment, specifications, customer documentation, configuration management, verification\ntesting, validation activities and maintenance.\n\nIndividual Software Engineering Processes must be governed by standards which define\ndevelopment phases such as those identified in Subsection 19.9.1 above, from user require-\nments capture through the whole process to operations and maintenance.\n\n19.9.4 Software product quality assurance\n\nProduct quality objectives and the metrics used are chosen to be applicable directly to\nthe project and as such are unique to the project. There is no standard set of objectives\nand metrics. Both the objectives and metrics must be quantitative, and the means to\nobtain their values defined explicitly. The PA engineer is responsible for ensuring the\nmeasurement process is correctly executed throughout the development cycle.\n\n\n\n640 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\nProduct quality requirements form a set of requirements in their own right. These may\nwell be derived from some of the user requirements, and will generally have been approved\nby the customer. The main characteristics of these software quality requirements are that\nthey shall be: correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, verifiable and traceable. The\nsoftware must be designed to facilitate testing, and the required testing must be capable\nof being executed as planned. Note that modifying the testing baseline can lead to the\npassing of a test that proves nothing, which will not satisfy an alert customer.\n\nSoftware intended for re-use is sometimes commissioned by a customer, but more\noften, a contractor develops it for multiple applications in his software inventories. Soft-\nware intended for re-use must go through some extra steps: documentation must specify\nthe platforms on which it is expected to operate, testing on all such platforms must be per-\nformed and the developer must certify that the tests were carried out to a named standard\nand were successful.\n\nStandard ground segments for operational systems are also heavily software driven. For\na new facility, the hardware and software would certainly be procured as a compatible pair.\nFor an existing ground facility, the acquisition of new software may demand changes to\nthe hardware/operating system environment. Whatever approach is taken, there are some\nessential requirements that must be satisfied in the acquisition process:\n\n\u2022 performance,\n\u2022 maintenance,\n\u2022 durability and technical consistency with the operational equipment,\n\u2022 assessment of the product against requirements, including criticality,\n\u2022 available support documentation,\n\u2022 acceptance and warranty conditions,\n\u2022 conditions of installation, preparation, training and use,\n\u2022 maintenance conditions, including the possibilities of evolutionary development\n\u2022 copyright constraints,\n\u2022 availability\u2014readiness, installation timeframe, training,\n\u2022 compatibility with existing facility and spacecraft control needs, and\n\u2022 site operational constraints\nFirmware can also sometimes be required, dedicated to a particular application. PA\n\ncontrols are included in the plan, that is keyed to the development life cycle. Since the\nfirmware is embedded in particular hardware, that hardware has to be marked permanently\nin such a way as to identify uniquely the hardware and its firmware.\n\n19.10 PA IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNASA, US DoD and ESA have adopted a standardized approach to defining the readiness\nof technologies to be used in spacecraft missions\u2014see Table 19.14. The common stages\nin development of new technology overlap some levels as shown in Table 19.15.\n\nThroughout, PA staff must aim to qualify the technology. This aim can affect deci-\nsions in the early TRL stages of development. \u2018Qualifiability\u2019 is a challenge in all these\nactivities, as emphasized by the following examples:\n\n\u2022 Atomic Clocks are needed in navigation satellites for their extremely accurate time\nmeasurements. To qualify such a clock on the ground requires test apparatus that\n\n\n\nPA IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS 19.10 641\n\nTable 19.14 Technology readiness levels\n\nTechnology Description\nreadiness level\n\nTRL 1 Basic principles observed and reported\n\nTRL 2 Technology concept and/or application formulated\n\nTRL 3 Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic\nproof-of-concept\n\nTRL 4 Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment\n\nTRL 5 Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment\n\nTRL 6 System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment\n(ground or space)\n\nTRL 7 System prototype demonstration in a space environment\n\nTRL 8 Actual system completed and \u2018flight qualified\u2019 through test and demonstration\n(ground or space)\n\nTRL 9 Actual system \u2018flight proven\u2019 through successful mission operations\n\nTable 19.15 Technology development stages\n\nDevelopment stage TRL1 TRL2 TRL3 TRL4 TRL5 TRL6 TRL7 TRL8 TRL9\n\nBasic technology research.\n\nResearch to prove feasibility\n\nTechnology development.\n\nTechnology demonstration.\n\nSystem/subsystem dev\u2019t.\n\nSystem test, launch and ops.\n\nis much more accurate than the clock being tested. This is a very challenging task.\nManufacturers refer to such test configurations as a \u2018test solution\u2019, acknowledging\nthe difficult problem they have solved.\n\n\u2022 Large Deployable Antennas with multiple struts and ribs are typically folded-up\nand packed during the launch phase and only deployed when in orbit. These are\nespecially difficult to qualify on the ground (see also Chapter 15). Gravitational\nforce is always present, and however the on-ground deployment testing is performed\nit is subject to forces that are not present in orbit. The intended communications\nservice is often critically dependent on the geometrical accuracy of the deployed\nantennae. The customer rightly demands that it should be proven. Testing in one\norientation, and in the inverted orientation, can give some confidence by assuming\nthat the zero-g configuration would be expected to be somewhere between the two\nmeasured on-ground deployed positions. Even so, it is difficult to prove that the\n\n\n\n642 PRODUCT ASSURANCE\n\ndynamics of deployment, as observed in ground testing, will be the same as that\nwhich will occur in-orbit. In reality, a zero-g qualification is not possible on ground.\nUltimately, operating an instrumented test device in orbit may be the only way to\nobtain genuine qualification.\n\n\u2022 Pointing Accuracy Requirements on spacecraft continue to become more and more\ndemanding, especially in astronomy missions. The James Webb Telescope is expected\nto achieve a pointing accuracy of 10?6 deg. or 0.0036 arc-sec. Demonstrating this\non ground is an extremely challenging task. It may only be possible to demonstrate\nstability of pointing, rather than absolute pointing accuracy.\n\n19.11 THE ASSURANCE MESSAGE\n\nThe text of this chapter and the general principles mentioned are all intended to help the\nproduct assurance engineer carry out the job effectively.\n\nThis author has been consulting in the space insurance sector for over two decades,\nand one problem that crops up repeatedly is the occurrence of failures through inadequate\nor flawed Qualification by Similarity. Such a qualification method is not wrong, but the\n\u2018similarity\u2019 has to be close for the qualification to be valid. All of the parameters need\nto be close, not just those that are headlined. \u2018This unit is in-flight qualified\u2019 is, by itself,\njust not good enough. Also, to be considered are such parameters as the application,\nthe expected temperature envelope, the tolerance to power fluctuations, and so on. Is its\nuse the first on the selected launcher? If so, will it withstand the vehicle\u2019s vibration and\ng-force environment?\n\nWhatever task product assurance engineers perform, they should always ask\nthemselves\u2014what does this task actually contribute? Has the risk been reduced? Do we\nneed any extra tasks or tests that have not yet been planned?

In the main\nbody of the text the subsystems have been discussed and the interfaces between them have\nbeen considered. All of these aspects are drawn together in this final chapter in which the\nsystem engineering process required to ensure the overall spacecraft meets the mission\nobjectives is explained and illustrated with a discussion of a specific spacecraft\u2014the\nEuropean Space Agency\u2019s CryoSat . There are many other examples that could have been\nchosen but this particular example provides a good demonstration of the breadth and\ncomplexity of mission drivers which arise in the search for optimum solutions to such\nchallenging mission objectives.\n\nSystem engineering is often characterized as both an art and a science. This apt char-\nacterization is appropriate because good system engineering requires the creativity and\nknowledge of systems engineers, but it also requires systems management or the appli-\ncation of a systematic disciplined approach. In this chapter the systematic disciplined\napproach is considered in more detail, and there is emphasis on the methodology of\nsystems engineering, particularly in the section on the use of concurrent engineering .\n\nThe mission requirements are the top level requirements on the spacecraft. They are\nquantitative in nature and must be specified by the customer or user, and they are an\nassessment of the performance required to meet the mission objectives. For the space-\ncraft system design these requirements are translated into engineering parameters. This\ntranslation can be complex, depending on the particular application.\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W. Fortescue, Graham G. Swinerd and John P. W. Stark.\n\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n\n\n644 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nFor a communication spacecraft, the translation is relatively straightforward since the\nuser coverage and data requirements can readily be used to define the satellite parameters.\nThe link budget described in Chapter 12 is at the heart of this process. On a satellite such\nas CryoSat , however, described in Section 20.4, the translation of the user requirements\nin terms of geophysical parameters, such as ice thickness changes of a few centimetres,\ninto instrument specifications is complex and involves many system algorithms. In this\ncase the process involves assumptions about other related parameters, such as the level of\nprocessing required and the orbital data available from other sources. During the design\nprocess these assumptions may prove to be incorrect and the engineering requirements\nwill have to be modified. It may also be necessary to modify the requirements as a result\nof a clearer understanding of the impact they have on the spacecraft design.\n\nThis iterative process is essential to ensure that the most relevant and realistic\nrequirements are used for the spacecraft design. There are plenty of examples where\nthe engineering requirements have become \u2018tablets of stone\u2019 at the start of the design\nand the overall system has suffered because of unwillingness to question them as the\ndesign has evolved. It is always necessary to define how much quality is needed, or how\nmuch \u2018science\u2019 is enough in order to hold down mission costs and avoid unnecessarily\nrestrictive requirements. In other examples, technological constraints such as the inability\nto space qualify critical parts or processes, may dictate a revision of requirements.\n\nThere is another issue that can determine the design approach taken. The procurement of\ncommercial communication satellites is targeted towards meeting market needs perceived\nto be arising through increased capacity requirements. Since a commercial organization is\ngenerally driven by the need to satisfy customers\u2019 needs, in competition with other sup-\npliers, timeliness is of the essence. This commercialism is demonstrated by Intelsat which\nbecame a private company in 2001 and has since been acquired by Serafina Holdings;\nan entity formed from equity investors. Private equity firms are keen to be involved with\nsatellite operators because their business guarantees steady cash flows.\n\nAs a result of these commercial considerations, the principal mission requirements\nfor communication satellites are specified at the outset. Engineering solutions must be\nproposed to solve these specific requirements, although clearly some level of discussion\ntakes place between contractors and customer to define them precisely. These programmes\ntherefore do not go through the iterative process associated with missions such as Envisat ,\nwhich are principally experimental in nature and used to establish the user market. Instead,\ntheir design iterations are more directed towards having a major impact on the timescale of\nthe programme, and its cost. Even in this market, however, there needs to be an apprecia-\ntion by the user community of the implications of their requirements on the overall design.\nIt is this appreciation that has led to the pressure in the USA and Europe to reduce the\nscale of the spacecraft proposed and designed for science and Earth observation applica-\ntions over the past 10 years. Further discussions of these issues are given in Section 20.4,\nwhere the rationale for the relatively inexpensive satellite, CryoSat , is described.\n\n20.2 SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\n20.2.1 Programme phases\n\nThe overall process of system engineering may be conveniently understood by considering\nthe way in which space programmes are broken down into individual phases.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM ENGINEERING 20.2 645\n\nThe total time from the initial conception of a complex mission to its launch and\noperation can extend over a period of 10 years, and sometimes even longer when delays\nare introduced due to funding limitations or the mission itself has to be of long duration.\nThe Rosetta mission was approved in 1993, and was launched in March 2004. The\nspacecraft will rendezvous with the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in May 2014,\nwith the end of its planned mission in December 2015. The New Horizons mission to\nPluto and the Kuiper Belt finally gained financial approval in 2003, and was launched\nin 2006. The spacecraft will fly-by Pluto in 2015 before going on to encounter objects\nwithin the Kuiper Belt from 2016 to 2020. Many missions fall by the wayside through\nfailure to gain funding approval. As a measure of the competition that exists, in response\nto ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 call for proposals, 50 proposals were received and in\n2010 three were selected for further definition.\n\nSeveral factors influence the duration of the planning cycle for the new mission\nselection. Firstly, political and financial constraints can impede the smooth flow of a\nprogramme. Secondly, launch opportunities can be limited, particularly for interplanetary\nmissions. The Giotto spacecraft, for example, presented a once in a lifetime opportunity\nto encounter Comet Halley and this imposed critical deadlines for development and\nlaunch. In some cases there will be the need to demonstrate or develop new technology\nbefore the feasibility of the mission can be adequately assured. This generally has most\nimpact upon the \u2018engineering\u2019 timescale of a programme.\n\nThe spacecraft programme is traditionally divided into several distinct phases, as out-\nlined below. It is worth noting that this format is not adopted for small satellites and it may\nbe significantly shortened in the case of commercial programmes, particularly if existing\nbuses are used. It should also be said that the definitions used in different organizations\n(e.g. ESA and NASA) can vary.\n\nPhase A (feasibility)\n\nThis phase, lasting typically 8\u201312 months, is termed the feasibility or outline design\nphase. Its objectives include:\n\n\u2022 selection of an optimum (and cost effective) system concept from the range of options\nunder consideration;\n\n\u2022 demonstration of the feasibility of the project by design and analysis;\n\u2022 definition of a technical solution to the extent necessary to generate and substantiate\n\nrealistic performance, schedule, planning and cost data for all subsequent phases.\n\nThis Phase is sometimes split further into a pre-Phase A, or Phase 0 , wherein specific\naspects of the system are considered in outline. The use of concurrent engineering facili-\nties, described in Section 20.3, is particularly useful in this stage of the design. It enables\nthe user to be involved in establishing the system requirements. The cost of performing\nthis phase is relatively low, but the cost implications arising from it are large. The ultimate\ncost of the mission will depend on decisions made during the early phases of the design.\n\nIn a spacecraft Phase A study, the customer normally provides preliminary information\non mission, launcher and payload requirements, as well as a target performance speci-\nfication. System engineering plays a central role in the selection of a preferred concept\nin these early phases as indicated by the flow diagram in Figure 20.1 (by their very\n\n\n\n646 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nExperience\nfrom previous\nprogrammes\n\nSupporting technical analysis\n\nRequirement analysisInput from\ncustomers\n\nConcept\nselection\n\nSystem\ndefinition\n\nInitial analysis\nTranslate existing reqts. into\nsystem spec. in all areas\nEstablish technical/cost\ndrivers\nSeek relaxation of most\ndemanding requirements\n\nConcept\nevolution\n\nPerformance\nanalysis\n\nSubsystem\nrequirements\n\nFurther\nsystem\nanalysis\n\nOverall\nsystem\n\nsynthesis\n\nTo programme and\ncost estimation\n\nand further phase\n\nSubsystem\ndefinition\n\nRefinements\nof system\n\nrequirements\n\nSystem sensitivity\n(parametric analysis)\nIdentification & trade-off of\nmain system options\nBroad assessment of\ntechnical feasibility\nTop level budget allocation\n\nSystem reqts.\nInterface reqts.\nSpecs., standards\nRef. documents\n\nFirst iteration of\nsystem requirements\n\nFurther iteration of system requirements\n\nFigure 20.1 Phase A system engineering flow diagram\n\nnature some of the design tasks are iterative rather than sequential). The system engineer\nprovides an overview of the entire system in order to advise the programme manager\nand the customer on the overall technical feasibility. The preliminary requirements review\n(PRR) is held at the end of Phase A. The outcome of this review is used to judge the\nreadiness of the project to move into Phase B.\n\nOnce the programme has gained approval or a contract is awarded to a prime contractor ,\nthe subsequent phases are summarized below.\n\nPhase B (detailed definition)\n\nThis phase will typically last 12\u201318 months. A significant extension of the phase may\noccur in large agency (ESA, NASA, etc.) programmes if financial and political consider-\nations slow down the process of full mission commitment. This phase is associated with\ndetailed design and definition. Specific activities include:\n\n\u2022 definition of the system and subsystems designs in sufficient detail to allow the main\ndesign and development phase C/D to proceed with the minimum of problems;\n\n\u2022 production of subsystem requirements and design specifications, subsystem and\nequipment design and development plans, programme schedules and a full proposal\nfor the subsequent C/D phases;\n\n\u2022 initiation of advanced C/D activities such as ordering of long-lead items or detailed\ndesign of critical parts.\n\nThe reviews in this definition phase are the system requirements review (SRR), the\nsystem design review (SDR) and the non-advocate or independent review.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM ENGINEERING 20.2 647\n\nAlthough the tasks are similar in any space programme, there are some differences\nbetween agencies in the way that the phases are defined. In ESA, for example, Phase B is\nreferred to as the preliminary definition phase and the preliminary design review (PDR)\nis held at the end of this Phase.\n\nThere is also a tendency, in ESA, towards splitting the Phase B into Phase B1 and B2.\nThe former is regarded as part of the programme preparation while the latter is part of\nthe implementation phase and is thus combined contractually with the Phase C, D and,\noften, E1 as well. The distinction between the two parts of the phase B is that during the\nphase B1 the prime contractor prepares tender invitations for all of the subsystems and\nequipments which could be open to competition, and, together with ESA, evaluates the\nproposals. The selected subcontractors are then brought into the team during the phase B2.\n\nPhase C/D (design, development, manufacture, integration and verification)\n\nThis is the longest phase, and may extend for three to five years. It encompasses\ndevelopment, manufacture, integration and verification. The specific activities (see also\nChapter 17) include:\n\n\u2022 completion of all design and analyses;\n\u2022 preparation of manufacturing drawings and special procedures;\n\u2022 completion of all development and qualification testing;\n\u2022 manufacture of the flight hardware and acceptance testing.\n\nThe preliminary design review (PDR), critical design review (CDR), test readiness\nreview (TRR) and flight readiness review (FRR) all take place in this phase.\n\nPhase E (the mission operations and data analysis)\n\nThe Phase E starts after the spacecraft has passed the flight readiness review, and is\nnormally divided into two parts: Phase E1 is concerned with getting the satellite (and the\nrest of the system) into a condition when it can start routine operations, which constitute\nthe Phase E2 (see also Chapter 14). Phase E1 normally includes the shipment to the\nlaunch site and preparations for launch (the \u2018launch campaign\u2019). This is followed by the\nlaunch and early orbit phase (LEOP), which is the critical first few days of operations\nafter launch. This includes mission critical activities such as deployment of appendages.\nAt the end of LEOP the satellite should be in a stable, self-sufficient condition, although\npayload equipment may not yet be switched on.\n\nLEOP is followed by a commissioning phase, where the spacecraft, the payload and any\nrequired ground infrastructure are brought into an operational condition, are checked out\nand are optimized, tuned and, if necessary, debugged. Calibration and validation activities\nmay also take place during this phase.\n\nAt the end of commissioning, routine operations start, and this marks the beginning of\nthe Phase E2. Routine operations rely on ground support staff (and, potentially consum-\nables) and thus incur an annual cost. This can be expensive, although early system design\nto maximize autonomy, for example by means of intelligent failure detection, isolation\nand recovery (FDIR), can significantly reduce this.\n\n\n\n648 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\n-Development\n-M.A.I.T\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nENGINEERING\n\nDESIGN AND\nCONFIGURATION\n\nANALYSIS\n\nVERIFICATION\n\nSYSTEM\nENGINEERING\n\nProduct\nAssuranceOperations and Logistics\n\n= Interface Area= Other Programme Disciplines= System Engineering Scope\n\nMAIT  = manufacturing, assembly, integration and test\nPM&P = parts, materials and processes\n\nProduction\n\nSYSTEM ENGINEERING INTEGRATION AND CONTROL\n\nManagement\n\n- Cost\n- Planning\n- Configuation control\n- Procurement\n- Information\n- Documentation\n\n- Operations Engineering\n- Operations Verfication\n- Logistic Analysis\n\n- Product\n  assurance\n- Dependability\n- Verification\n- Procurement\n- Criticality\n  analysis\n- PM&P\n- Safety\n- EEE component\n\nFigure 20.2 System engineering boundaries.

Figure 20.3 shows how it is then necessary to\nexpand these top-level requirements into specifications covering the entire range of system\nand subsystem engineering parameters. It also shows the importance of establishing, in\nparallel, technical budget data.\n\nTable 20.2 is intended to act as a checklist of the full range of parameters that are likely\nto be specified in later, more detailed phases of a programme.\n\nIn the early conceptual design phases of a new mission, choices may have to be made\nbetween system-level options for the class of orbit, the launcher type, the propulsion\n\n\n\n650 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nTable 20.2 Check-list of system requirements\n\nMission requirements (Chapters 4, 5, 14) Physical requirements (Chapters 3, 9, 10)\nLaunch windows Axes definition\nOrbit (transfer; operating Configuration constraints\n-nominal and back-up) Dimensions\nOperations Mass\n-Launch & early orbit phase Mass properties\n-Operational phase Internal torques\n-End-of-life Disturbances\nLifetime Power/energy\n(Retrieval/repair/re-supply)?\nAutonomy Performance requirements (Chapters 5, 8, 9,\nReliability/availability 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)\nGround segment Orbit maintenance\n\nRanging accuracy\nEnvironmental requirements (Chapters 2, Timing accuracy\n7, 8, 11, 16, 17) Pointing accuracy\nGround activities Measurement accuracy\nLaunch & ascent conditions Stability\nTransfer & operating orbit environment Pointing range\n(Re-entry, descent)?

Here\nwe briefly consider a single example\u2014the choice of orbit for an astronomy mission. This\nhighlights some of the key points that must be taken into account in concept selection\nand optimization.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM ENGINEERING 20.2 651\n\nLow to\nmedium\n\ninclination\n\nNear polar\n(Sun synch)\n\nHipparcos\n(intended)\n\nLow earth\norbit (LEO)\n\nGeostationary\norbit (GEO).\n\nEarth\norbits\n\nHighly elliptical\norbit (HEO)\n\nHigher\ne.g. 96 hr\n\nLunar\nsurface\n\nDeep\nspace\n\nSun\u2013earth\nlibration points\n\nEXOSAT\nINTEGRAL\n\nXMM-Newton\n\n12 hr 24 hr\n\nIUE\nISO\n\nCircular or elliptical\n\nSun\n\nEarth\n\nMoon\n\nGAIA\nHerschel\nJames Webb ST\n\nPolar;\nLunar\nbase\n\n1.5 \u00d7 106 km\n\nEarly ISO\nconcept\n\nTD1\nIRAS\nCOBE\n\nHST\nGRO\nROSAT\nSolar Max\n\nFigure 20.4 Orbit options for astronomy missions\n\nFigure 20.4 is a tree diagram showing the possible orbits about the Earth, and beyond,\nwhich could be adopted for an astronomy mission. With the exception of the lunar surface,\nall of the listed orbits have actually been selected as indicated by the mission names in\nthe diagram.\n\nThe main point to emerge from it is that the choice of orbit for this class of mission is by\nno means clear-cut. Much depends on the existing infrastructure in the form of launcher\navailability, data retrieval capabilities or existing spacecraft bus designs. For example\nNASA\u2019s major observatories\u2014the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Gamma Ray\nObservatory (GRO)\u2014had to be in a circular low earth orbit (LEO) in order that they\ncould be launched/serviced by the space shuttle, and TDRSS could be used for data\nretrieval. However, ESA\u2019s astronomy missions, such as Integral and the X-ray Multi-\nMirror Mission (XMM-Newton) selected highly elliptical orbits to guarantee long periods\nof uninterrupted observation away from trapped radiation in the Earth\u2019s proton and elec-\ntron belts. Other missions such as GAIA, Herschel and the James Webb Space Telescope\nhave selected orbits around a point about 1.5 million km from Earth in the direction away\nfrom the Sun known as the L2 Lagrangian point (see Chapter 4). In this orbit, advantage\ncan be taken of the fact that the benign thermal and radiation environments are ideal for\nlong-duration observations. In addition there is continuous solar power and a continuous\ncommunications link. Other spacecraft, such as NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft, are in orbits\naround the Sun trailing the Earth so that a star field can be observed continuously for\nseveral years.\n\nReuse of existing designs of spacecraft equipment offer very significant savings com-\npared to new developments\u2014for example, the satellite bus used for Venus Express was\nalmost a copy of that used for Mars Express . The cost of the satellite bus, the launcher\nand ground segment operations over the mission life feature very significantly in the total\nprogramme cost and can have a dominant effect on early trade-offs. Clearly the ensuing\nspacecraft system and subsystem design for LEO, HEO or other options can differ greatly\nas a result of the very different environmental constraints and orbit conditions.\n\n\n\n652 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\n20.2.3 Design drivers\n\nThe payload is, in most cases, the single most significant driver of the satellite design.\nThe purpose of the satellite bus is to provide the support required for the payload to\nensure that it can be operate in the required orbit and environment. Power, heating and\ncooling, structure and communication are all provided to ensure that the payload can\noperate satisfactorily and relay its data back to ground. The propulsion subsystem, the\nAttitude and Orbit Control subsystem (AOCS) and the mission analysis provide the means\nof getting the payload into the right position to make its measurements. In the case of\nGiotto, the spacecraft that intercepted Halley\u2019s Comet, for example, the retrograde orbit of\nHalley around the sun meant that any interception had to occur at extremely high velocity\n(?70 km/s) and the spacecraft had to have a means of protection against particles moving\nat this speed. The design of the bumper shield therefore became a key design driver.\nIt also became necessary to spin the spacecraft to provide gyroscopic rigidity to ensure\nthat it remained in the right orientation for the payload to view the nucleus and transmit\ndata to the Earth. On the other hand Rosetta , the next ESA cometary mission, is due to\nrendezvous with the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and move along with it orbiting\naround the nucleus at a few centimetres per second, as it draws closer to the Sun. This\ncomet has a prograde orbit. It is therefore possible for the spacecraft to have a three-\naxis stabilized configuration. In both cases the design of the spacecraft stems from the\nrequirements and constraints imposed by the payload.\n\n20.2.4 Trade-offs\n\nIt is common to make use of trade-off tables to \u2018score\u2019 the alternative options in early\nconcept studies. Major evaluation criteria for such trade-offs include:\n\n\u2022 cost, which is generally a dominant factor;\n\u2022 satisfaction of performance requirements (e.g. image quality in an Earth\n\nobservation mission);\n\u2022 physical characteristics, notably mass, size and power which, in turn, impact on cost\n\nand feasibility;\n\u2022 availability of suitable hardware technology and timescales for any predevelopment;\n\u2022 compatibility with launcher, ground segment and other system elements, and the\n\ncomplexity of interfaces;\n\u2022 flexibility to encompass alternative mission options;\n\u2022 reliability and availability.\nIf some of these criteria are considered more important than others then a weighted\n\ntrade-off can be performed. Regardless of whether a trade-off is weighted or not, it\nshould only be used as a guide. It is impossible to guarantee that a trade-off is entirely\nobjective and that the evaluation criteria are exhaustive and independent. Cost, for\nexample, is influenced by all the criteria above and its use as an independent parameter is\nhighly questionable.\n\nOnly some of these factors lend themselves to quantitative evaluation and hence direct\ncomparison to select a preferred solution. Other factors in the list are fairly subjective\nand rely more on broad engineering judgment than on the results of parametric analyses\n\n\n\nSYSTEM ENGINEERING 20.2 653\n\nand optimization methods. Still others may be quantitative in nature but, in the early\nstages of a programme the estimation of the respective values may be too coarse to allow\na single solution to be selected with confidence from the range of options. However,\ndespite its shortcomings, a trade-off analysis is often helpful in identifying design drivers,\nand in focusing resources on issues that may threaten feasibility. Finally, it should be\nnoted that, as in the example of orbit selection for an astronomy mission, there may not\nnecessarily be a single preferred choice and two or more alternative approaches may be\nequally viable.\n\n20.2.5 Budgets\n\nAn important system engineering tool is that concerned with system budgeting. At space-\ncraft level the main system budgets to be compiled include:\n\n\u2022 mass and mass properties (e.g. centre of mass, inertias);\n\u2022 ?V and associated propellant quantity;\n\u2022 power and energy;\n\u2022 pointing and stabilization;\n\u2022 aligment/boresight error (e.g. of a payload sightline with respect to nominal\n\nspacecraft axes);\n\u2022 telemetry and telecommand budgets;\n\u2022 data rate and storage capacity (if appropriate);\n\u2022 communication link budgets;\n\u2022 reliability.\n\nAlmost invariably mass and power are at a premium in space programmes, but just how\ncritically they are constrained depends on the type of mission. The design drivers\u2014such\nas payload power demand and data rate for CryoSat , or pointing and stabilization for an\nastronomical telescope\u2014must be established from the outset. Devolving the key system\nrequirements and budgets to subsystem level, and iterating these as necessary, is intimately\nlinked to other steps in the system engineering processes in the early programme stages.\nThese steps traditionally include the identification of alternative concepts, trade-offs of\nthese options against the main evaluation criteria and the shortlisting of preferred solutions.\nParametric analyses at system and subsystem level are necessary to establish system\nsensitivities and technical drivers.\n\nNote that the system requirements listed in Table 20.2, and the associated budgets, are\napplicable to almost all types of spacecraft. If one were to consider a specific mission, it\nwould be necessary to extend the list of mission and payload requirements still further.\nFor example, a remote sensing payload is generally characterized by parameters including\nspectral and spatial resolution, dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, calibration accuracy,\nand the area and repeat frequency of coverage. Only a few of these parameters are\nthemselves subject to compilation of budgets but they all play a part, in a very interactive\nmanner, in establishing the optimum system design.\n\nThe system engineering tasks must be applied throughout the overall programme and\nnot just in the early phases. In particular the following aspects must be addressed:\n\n\u2022 compliance of all physical and performance parameters with the system requirements;\n\n\n\n654 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\n\u2022 devolution of the system-level specification and budgets to subsystem level;\n\u2022 resolution of conflicts at detailed design level to establish the most cost-effective\n\ncompromise solution satisfying overall mass, risk, cost and other targets;\n\u2022 definition, monitoring and control of interfaces between all system elements and\n\nbetween subsystems;\n\u2022 detailing of operational procedures for the mission;\n\u2022 management and maintenance of budgets for mass, power, fuel and other key\n\nresources;\n\u2022 analysis of \u2018system-level\u2019 factors such as reliability, EMC and chemical cleanliness.\n\n20.3 CONCURRENT ENGINEERING\n\n20.3.1 Introduction\n\nConcurrent Engineering (CE) is a set of techniques in which the design, development,\nprocurement and manufacturing of a product is carried out by near-real-time teamwork. In\naddition, there is a high level of integration of tools between all the disciplines involved\nin the process, and the same design facility or environment is shared by all the parties\ninvolved in the product life-cycle. The aim of this approach is to drastically reduce the\ntime to market and the cost of development, and to increase the quality of the product.\n\nConcurrent Engineering has been active in academia and industry for more than 30\nyears. The concept was introduced in the aeronautics industry, and it has been continuously\ndeveloped and extended into several other industrial sectors and into the broader range\nof the whole product life-cycle.\n\nA related sub-discipline, collaborative and distributed engineering , though maintain-\ning the characteristics of near-real-time activities and tool integration, puts the focus on\nthe involvement of different remote sites. This is mostly concerned with multi-company\nprojects, management of suppliers, etc. in which team integration is somehow looser.\n\nTo explain the principles of CE, a specific illustrative implementation will be used in\nthis section\u2014that of the ESA Concurrent Design Facility (CDF), which is sited at ESA\nESTEC in the Netherlands [2].\n\nDepending mainly on the context and the application environment, various definitions\nof concurrent engineering have, up to now, been introduced and used in literature. The\ndefinition of CE adopted in the ESA CDF is:\n\n\u2018Concurrent Engineering is a systematic approach to integrated product development\nthat emphasises the response to customer expectations. It embodies team values of co-\noperation, trust and sharing in such a manner that decision making is by consensus,\ninvolving all perspectives in parallel, from the beginning of the product life-cycle.\u2019\n\n20.3.2 Concurrent Design\n\nExperience shows that space system engineering is particularly suited to the early formu-\nlation of the space mission and to conceptual design. In this case Concurrent Design\n\n\n\nCONCURRENT ENGINEERING 20.3 655\n\nSequential Design\n\nCentralized Design\n\nConcurrent Design\n\nCommunication\nbarrier / fence\n\nFigure 20.5 Alternative approaches to space system design\n\n(CD) represents an alternative to other approaches. The three main types of design\nmethodology are:\n\n\u2022 Sequential\n\u2022 Centralized\n\u2022 Concurrent\n\nwhich are schematically represented in Figure 20.5.\nThe most \u2018classical\u2019 method is the sequential approach. The overall design passes,\n\nduring the various design steps, from a technical domain specialist (working in isolation\nfrom the rest of the design team) to another, in successive time intervals\u2014in other words\na sequence of specialists working \u2018in series\u2019. The removal of design inconsistencies, to\nguarantee the design convergence, is obtained by the process of iteration. Due to lack\nof communication among the specialists (that is why it is also known as the \u2018over-the-\nfence\u2019 approach), incorrect assumptions may be adopted, the main system parameters\nare not monitored in real-time, and consequently several iterations may be necessary to\nreach the ultimate goal. This can lead to a very lengthy process. This method has some\n\n\n\n656 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nadvantages, such as the flexibility in the use of manpower resources and the fact that\nit is a well-tried and routine process. On the other hand it reduces the opportunity to\nfind interdisciplinary solutions and to create system awareness in the specialists. Further-\nmore, in such a \u2018decentralized\u2019 approach, all the design data and models are dispersed\namong the specialists. It is then very difficult, if not impossible, to re-assemble all of this\nknowledge, for instance to resume the design with modified requirements at a later time.\nLast but not least, the time required for performing studies using the classical approach\n(6\u20139 months) was incompatible with the drive towards a shorter time-scale from concept\nto flight.\n\nAn improvement to the sequential approach is represented by the centralized design\nmethod , where the various technical domain specialists provide subsystem design infor-\nmation and data to a core team of one or more system engineers. Their task it is to\nanalyse and check the design at system level, promoting and encouraging communication\nbetween specialists when appropriate or required.\n\nAn alternative to the classical approach is offered by Concurrent Engineering in which\nthe design method provides better performance by taking full advantage of modern infor-\nmation technology (IT). The enabling factor for the CE approach has been the rapid\nevolution of IT. The complete design team, composed of the various technical domain\nspecialists, starts working on the different aspects of the project at the beginning of\nthe design process. The rapid gain of design consistency and the final acquisition of\noverall project convergence are obtained by constant, direct communication and data\ninterchange between the team members, working in real-time in a common design envi-\nronment. The process still encompasses a number of iterations where all disciplines are\nrequested to present their proposals and results in rapid succession, thus minimizing the\nrisk of divergence from the desired path. The co-location of experts from various dis-\nciplines to elucidate a preliminary design concept is not a novelty in itself. However,\nin the past the process and personal interactions were limited to basic brainstorming\nsessions, because any numerical analysis required the use of tools which could not\nprovide results in real time, nor easily be interconnected or co-located with the team.\nNowadays, with perhaps few exceptions, most of the analysis needed for the prelim-\ninary design phases can be performed in real time on a personal computer (PC) or\non a lap-top.\n\nThe concurrent approach is particularly effective in improving the design process of\ncomplex systems in which many disciplines are involved, such as in the case of space\nmission design.\n\nAs all the aspects of the spacecraft mission design are studied at the same time with the\nuse of the concurrent design approach, the degree of project design consistency improves\nrapidly. The time period required for the study is also dramatically shorter than in the\ncase of a classical design approach. Each discipline is, in fact, always in communication\nwith all the others, and all design decisions, when not directly taken at team level, are\nquickly communicated to the whole team for immediate verification. In the concurrent\napproach every design issue, starting with the revision of mission requirements, is dis-\ncussed collectively. Hence, there is a general awareness of the decisions taken. Therefore,\nall the design team members can constantly follow the same design path, avoiding the\noccurrence of incompatible approaches to the various subsystems\u2019 design, and therefore\nreducing the time and workload required by the mission study. The cornerstone of success\nin CE is communication.\n\n\n\nCONCURRENT ENGINEERING 20.3 657\n\n20.3.3 The ESA CDF\n\nEach year, the European Space Agency (ESA) performs a number of pre-Phase A (or\nLevel 0) assessment studies. The purpose of these studies is to assess the feasibility of a\nnew space mission from the technical, programmatic and economic points of view. This\nis normally achieved by producing a preliminary conceptual design of the mission and\nspace system. The study results are used to support the mission selection process. If the\nmission is accepted, the study report is used as an input to the industrial Phase-A design\nstudies. Such pre-Phase A studies are normally performed in-house at the European Space\nResearch and Technology Centre (ESTEC), by technical-support specialists.\n\nThe implementation of the ESA Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) started in 1998 at\nESTEC on an experimental basis with the initiative and support of the ESA General\nStudies Programme (GSP). In the space domain, there were a few other examples at that\ntime such as the NASA/JPL Project Design Center (PDC), used by Team X for conceptual\nmission design\u2014see Figure 20.6.\n\nFor ESA the objectives of the initiative were to:\n\n\u2022 create a mission design environment in which the conceptual design of space missions\ncould be performed in a more effective way;\n\n\u2022 apply the practice of concurrent engineering to a number of test cases to evaluate the\npotential of such an approach in the various phases of space mission development;\n\n\u2022 gather the information needed to evaluate the resources required to create a permanent\nfacility available to all ESA programmes.\n\nThe CDF is in effect an Integrated Design Environment (IDE) based on the concurrent\nengineering methodology. At ESA, CD is primarily used to assess the technical, program-\nmatic and financial feasibility of future space missions and new spacecraft concepts (e.g.\ninternal pre-phase A or Level-0 assessment studies).\n\nSpecific multidisciplinary CD applications are:\n\n\u2022 new mission concept assessment;\n\u2022 space system trade-offs and options evaluation;\n\u2022 new technology validation at system/mission level.\n\nAdditionally the ESA CDF is now used for many other multi-disciplinary applications,\nsuch as:\n\n\u2022 payload instrument preliminary design;\n\u2022 System of System (SoS) architectures - an SoS is a service and end-user-oriented\n\narchitecture, especially conceived for security applications, whereby disparate and\nindependent space assets are exploited in an integrated fashion to provide higher\nnumber and quality end-user services;\n\n\u2022 space exploration scenarios;\n\u2022 technology infusion and road mapping;\n\u2022 reviews of industrial Phase A studies;\n\u2022 scientific requirements definition and consolidation;\n\u2022 anomaly investigation (e.g. design inconsistencies found during testing or operations);\n\u2022 education and training.\n\n\n\n658 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nTeam X\nOperations\nManager\n\nArchitecture\nStudy Team\n\nArea B\n\nMission\nStudy Team\n\nArea A\n\nMotorized Video Screens\n\nWall Mount Video Screen\n\nWall Mount Smart Board\nHD Video Screens\n\nSystem\nAdministrators\n\nC\nU\n\nS\nT\n\nO\nM\n\nE\nR\n\nC\nU\n\nS\nT\n\nO\nM\n\nE\nR\n\nxx\nxxx xxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nInstrument\nStudy Team\n\nArea C\n\nServers\n\nHigh Definition\nRear Projection\n\nSystem\n\nStorage\n\nStorage\n\nStorage\n\nS\nto\n\nra\nge\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 20.6 The JPL Project Design Center (PDC) operated by Team X in Pasadena CA,\nUSA.

This consists\nof one component that is concerned with the interfacing of all the engineering tools\nand databases (DB) brought in by the various technical domains, in addition to another\ninvolving the implementation of real-time mechanisms for data sharing. This combination\ncomprises the so-called Integrated Design Model (IDM).\n\nIt is necessary to regroup the necessary expertise represented by the technical domain\nspecialists and proceed with their training to work together as a team . These specialists\nare not permanently and exclusively assigned to CDF activities, as this is just one of the\nseveral tasks they perform in a matrix-organization. One of the advantages of working\nin the concurrent environment is that the specialists get used to keeping the \u2018system\nperspective\u2019 in mind.\n\nThe concurrent engineering approach being adopted for the ESA CDF is based on five\nkey elements:\n\n\u2022 the process;\n\u2022 a multidisciplinary team;\n\u2022 an integrated design model;\n\u2022 the facility;\n\u2022 the hardware and software infrastructure.\n\nThe process\n\nThe conceptual model of the design process is shown in Figure 20.8, which highlights\nthe fact that a space system has many interdependencies between components. This\nimplies that the definition and evolution of each component has a design impact on other\ncomponents, and that any change will propagate through the system.

The ovals\nrepresent the disciplines, the boxes represent aggregated key parameters, the arrows\nare interactions and data exchange. Each discipline contributes, directly or indirectly to\nthe definition of the main mission parameters (or key parameters)\n\nof the impact of changes is essential to ensure that the design process converges to an\noptimized solution. The CE approach is intended to provide the means to maximize the\ninteraction among disciplines and to improve the means of achieving this early review\nand verification, step-by-step. The process starts with a preparation phase in which some\nrepresentatives of the engineering team (team leader, system engineer, selected special-\nists) and of the Customer meet to refine and formalize the mission requirements, to define\nthe constraints, to identify design drivers, and to estimate the resources needed to achieve\nthe study objectives.\n\nThe design process begins with the study \u2018kick-off\u2019. CDF activities are conducted in\na number of plenary meetings, referred to as \u2018sessions\u2019, in which representatives of all\nspace engineering domains participate, from the early phases (requirements analysis) to\nthe end of the design (costing).\n\nThe customer is invited to participate in all sessions along with other specialists of\ntheir choice (e.g. study scientist, project controller), so that they can contribute to the\nformulation of the study assumptions, answer questions from the team and follow the\nevolution of the design. This includes the possibility to discuss and correct in real-time\nany aspect of the design not in line with their expectations.\n\nThe first design session starts with the customer presenting the mission requirements\nand constraints to the team. In subsequent sessions, each specialist presents the proposed\noption or solutions for his or her domain, highlighting and discussing the implications\nfor the other domains. Out of the debate, a baseline is retained and the related parameter\n\n\n\nCONCURRENT ENGINEERING 20.3 661\n\nvalues recorded in a shared database. With the consensus of the customer, the mission\nrequirements and constraints might need to be modified or refined as a consequence of\nthe engineering process outcome.\n\nOne key factor is the ability to conduct a process that is not dependent on the path\nfollowed. At any stage it must be possible to take advantage of alternative paths or use\n\u2018professional estimates\u2019 to ensure that the process is not blocked by lack of data or lack\nof decisions. It is an iterative process that addresses all aspects of the system design in\na rapid and complete fashion. The concurrent design process conforms to the so-called\nSpiral Model illustrated in Figure 20.9. A spiral pattern is drawn in the plane of all\nengineering solutions which is subdivided into sectors, each one dedicated to a specific\ntechnical discipline. Each discipline is therefore responsible for the calculation of all the\ndesign parameters included in that portion of the plane.\n\nEach design iteration represents a rapid turn-around, in which, one-by-one, all the dis-\nciplines present the design (sizing, configuration etc.) of the subsystem they represent.\nThe design process consists of a number of successive passes across progressively refined\nsolutions, until all key parameters have reached the required target, i.e. all mission require-\nments and constraints have been satisfied. Each axis represents the value of a selected\ndesign key parameter, corresponding to mission or system requirements. It could, for\ninstance, be the total mass of the system, the launch date, the mission cost, or the mission\nand system performances. On each axis, the target value of the respective parameter can\nbe marked as shown in Figure 20.9. In this example with successive iterations the solution\napproaches the target T of the key parameter A.\n\nA certain number of spiral models can be \u2018drawn and executed\u2019, depending on the\nnumber of design options that need to be analysed and traded. Normally the spiral pattern\n(i.e. the design option) that features the \u2018best convergence\u2019 becomes the baseline design\nthat is carried through further iterations.\n\nKey parameter C\n\nKey parameter A\n\nKey parameter B\n\nSub-system design\n\nT\n\nMission analysis\n\nMission requirements\nanalysis\n\nRick assessment\n\nCost analysis\nDesign verification\n\nFigure 20.9 CE Iterative process: Spiral Model representation. In the example, point T\nis the target value of key parameter A\n\n\n\n662 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nThe acceptance of the proposed subsystem design solution and the decisions on the\nvarious trades are taken collectively by the team. The debate concerning the solutions\nproposed by one discipline is completed by the authorization to publish the related\ndata in the central repository (namely the data exchange), so making it available to the\nother domains.\n\nThis process must be repeated until the impact of the change has been propagated to\nthe point where design iterations no longer have a significant effect. In other words, when\nthe proposed system design satisfies all the requirements.\n\nThe team\n\nHuman resources are by far the most important element of the whole process! A group\nof engineering specialists working together in one room, using sophisticated tools, are all\nessential elements but this is not sufficient to create a collaborative environment. On the\ncontrary, it may become a place where conflicts are amplified. Above all else, the group\nof specialists must work as a team.\n\nA fundamental part of the concurrent engineering approach is to create a highly moti-\nvated, multi-disciplinary team that performs the design work in real-time. The challenge,\nthe novelty of the method, the collective approach, the co-operative environment, the\nintense and focused effort and a clear, short term goal are all essential elements that\ncontribute to personal motivation.\n\nTable 20.3 lists the technical disciplines typically involved in a CDF mission\nassessment study.\n\nFor each discipline, a \u2018position\u2019 is created within the facility and assigned to an expert\nwithin that particular technical domain. Each position is equipped with the necessary tools\nfor design modelling, calculations and data exchange.\n\nTable 20.3 Technical disciplines involved\nin a CDF mission assessment\n\nDiscipline/position\n\nSystems\nPayload instruments\nMission analysis\nPropulsion\nAttitude and orbit control\nStructures/configuration\nMechanisms/pyrotechnics\nThermal\nElectric power\nCommand and data handling\nCommunications\nGround systems and operations\nSimulation\nCost Analysis\nRisk Assessment\nProgrammatics\n\n\n\nCONCURRENT ENGINEERING 20.3 663\n\nThe choice of disciplines involved depends on the level of detail required and on the\nspecialization of the available expertise. On the other hand, the number of disciplines has\nto be limited, especially in the first experimental study, to avoid extended debate and to\nallow fast turn-around of design iterations. Normally the size of the team should allow\na full iteration to be run (i.e. all disciplines presenting their analyses) within a session,\nwhich in the ESA CDF lasts four hours. The ideal team is a balanced mix of young and\nmore experienced engineers.\n\nThe process is conducted by a Team Leader or Facilitator. This role is also crucial\nfor the success of the concurrent approach. A good team leader is normally a talented\nsystem engineer with skills in human resources management, who is able to conduct the\ndesign process dynamically and in real-time, while motivating people and maintaining a\nfast turn-around.\n\nThe model\n\nThe spacecraft design is based on mathematical models, which make use of custom soft-\nware and the CDF Integrated Design Model (IDM). By this means, a consistent set of\ndesign parameters can be defined and exchanged throughout the study, and any changes\nwhich may have an impact on other disciplines can immediately be identified and collec-\ntively assessed. In this way, a number of design iterations can be performed, and different\ndesign options can easily be analysed and compared.\n\nA parametric approach supports fast modification and analysis of new scenarios, which\nis essential for the real-time process. It acts as a means to establish and fix the ground\nrules of the design and to formalize the boundaries of responsibility of each domain. Once\na specific model is established it is then used to refine the design and to introduce further\nlevels of detail.\n\nThe first activity in the modelling process is to acquire or establish the model suited to\nthe mission scenario, before it is parameterized to enable the iterative design process. The\nCDF IDM is a tool developed in-house, which allows the integration of all of the subsys-\ntem discipline tools and parameters in a consistent and effective design environment. The\nmodel also represents the means to capture the technical knowledge and to document the\n\u2018engineering views\u2019 that are required to run the design processes. Figure 20.10 shows the\narchitecture of the IDM adopted in the ESA CDF.\n\nThe model consists of three parts:\n\n\u2014 Domain Specific Tools and Databases (e.g. tools for CAD, mission analysis, simu-\nlation, cost modelling and estimation; databases of launchers, materials, equipment,\netc.),\n\n\u2014 a multifunctional Intermediate Layer , simply based on several MS Excel workbooks\nand models,\n\n\u2014 a central data repository, called the Data Exchange.\n\nThe domain specific tools brought by each expert have to be integrated into the infras-\ntructure of the facility.\n\nThe intermediate layer is the integration element of the IDM because it provides the\ndata links among the disciplines and the interface between the domain specific tools.

In practice, multiple sheets are used\nfor the modelling process to enhance the clarity of the major parts of the design and to\nfacilitate display during design sessions.\n\nThe data exchange is the core of the IDM, containing the most up-to-date version of\nthe shareable data and linked, in turn, to all technical domain workbooks.\n\nThe CDF IDM template has been distributed to ESA partners, industry and academia to\nfacilitate the creation of their concurrent design centres. The principle of a standardized\nexchange of data, as applied in the IDM, has been proposed as a potential standard in the\ncontext of the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS).\n\nThe facility\n\nThe team of specialists meets in the Concurrent Design Facility (CDF), located within\nESA ESTEC, to perform design sessions.\n\nThe accommodation comprises a main design room as illustrated in Figure 20.11 plus\na project design room and a support design room. The equipment and layout of the\nCDF is designed to facilitate the design process, and the interaction, co-operation and\nthe involvement of the specialists. In particular, the disciplines with the most frequent\ninteraction, or other affinities (e.g. data/model sharing), are located close to each other.\nIn any case the facility can be reconfigured in different layouts and the disciplines can be\nrelocated or changed depending on the specific mission study.\n\n\n\nCONCURRENT ENGINEERING 20.3 665\n\nFigure 20.11 The new CDF, inaugurated at ESTEC on April 8, 2008. (Photo by Anneke\nLe Floc\u2019h, reproduced by permission of ESA)\n\nAt the front of the facility, large projection screens are used to project the display of\neach workstation so that specialists can present design options or proposals, and highlight\nany implications imposed on, or by, other domains. Video conferencing equipment is also\ninstalled to allow team members to participate in sessions from remote sites.\n\nThe hardware and software infrastructure\n\nThe infrastructure required to implement the concurrent design facility described above\ncan be summarized as:\n\n\u2022 software tools for the generation of the model;\n\u2022 integration of the domain models, with a means to propagate data between models\n\nin real time;\n\u2022 a means to incorporate domain specific tools for modelling and/or complex calcula-\n\ntions;\n\u2022 a documentation support system;\n\u2022 a storage and archive capability.\n\nThe infrastructure must allow its users to:\n\n\u2022 work remotely from the facility both within ESTEC and in other centres, for instance\nthe European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, or ESA HQ\nin Paris;\n\n\u2022 exchange information easily between the normal office working environment and the\nfacility environment.\n\nAlthough driven by the constraints identified above, the choice of tools has, in fact, proven\nto be satisfactory when looking to the future. Using tools that are already part of ESA\u2019s\ninfrastructure brings many benefits (e.g. low investment cost, reduced learning curve,\ncompatibility between office and facility automation tools).\n\n\n\n666 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nFor the system model, the choice of Excel spreadsheets was driven not only by its\navailability and the existing skills of the team, but also by the fact that earlier work had\nindicated it to be an ideal platform. A fundamental decision was taken to split the system\nmodel into components that mirror the domain of expertise of each of the team members,\nso allowing work to be performed on the modelling independently and in parallel, and\nwithout the reliance on a single modelling expert. This raised the need for a mechanism\nto exchange relevant data between domains in a controlled manner. This problem was\nsolved by preparing a shared workbook to integrate the data to be exchanged, with macros\nto handle the propagation of new data in a controlled way.\n\nBenefits of using Concurrent Design\n\nThe use of CD in the ESA CDF has demonstrated many advantages, and there are many\nfurther benefits that CE could bring when applied to later phases of the project life-cycle.\nFor a typical pre-Phase A study:\n\n\u2022 the study duration has reduced from 6\u20139 months to 3\u20136 weeks;\n\u2022 the corresponding cost has reduced by a factor of two;\n\u2022 the number of studies that are performed per year has increased;\n\u2022 the use of CD has resulted in an improvement in the quality of these technical assess-\n\nments by providing consistent and complete mission designs, including technical\nfeasibility, programmatic, cost and risk aspects.\n\nThrough the use of the centralized approach of the CDF, a data base of knowledge has\nbeen accumulated within the organization. The CDF results provide detailed information\nto ESA decision-making bodies to aid their assessment of which missions are selected for\nfurther industrial implementation. Furthermore this more detailed assessment of the new\npotential missions allows critical issues to be discovered and highlighted well in advance\nin the project life-cycle, and consequently this reduces the risk of engineering changes\nbeing required later or of mistakes occurring.\n\n20.3.4 Summary\n\nThe use of concurrent engineering has become embedded in the application of space\nsystems engineering, and there are now many concurrent design facilities around the\nworld. In this section one of these facilities, the ESA CDF, located at ESA ESTEC in the\nNetherlands, is described in detail to show how it is implemented within an organization.\nThe ESA CDF has now been in existence for over 10 years and its involvement in all\nphases of a space programme development continues to grow. It has enabled significant\nimprovements in overall performance by reducing the study duration and cost, and by\nallowing a considerable increase in the number of studies that can be performed. At the\nsame time, the quality has improved and the output of the CDF has become part of any\nfollow-on industrial activity. The ESA CDF is now an essential tool for ESA decision\nmaking, and in the associated risk management processes.\n\n\n\nA CASE STUDY: CRYOSAT 20.4 667\n\n20.4 A CASE STUDY: CRYOSAT\n\n20.4.1 Background\n\nCryoSat was the first of ESA\u2019s Earth Explorer satellites\u2014the first to be selected and\nthe first to be launched. Unfortunately, the launch failed after 300 s and the remains of\nthe satellite, destroyed during a fiery re-entry, landed in the very same polar ice it had\nbeen intended to measure from orbit. Its successor, CryoSat-2, was successfully launched\nexactly 4.5 years later. How did all this come about?\n\nIn 1991 ESA launched ERS -1, with its pair of sophisticated radars, into a Sun-\nsynchronous orbit which extended into the polar regions. But by this time plans were\nalready well advanced for a much more ambitious successor, called POEM -1, which\nwould carry a collection of 19 Earth-observation instruments into a Sun-synchronous\npolar orbit. The name POEM -1 was an acronym for the first Polar Orbiting Earth-\nobservation Mission. Since both ERS -1, about to be launched, and ERS -2, which was\napproved in 1988 as a gap-filler, were also polar orbiting Earth-observation missions this\nname was evidently poorly chosen. However, there is no evidence that this contributed\nto its demise in 1992!\n\nInstead it was the huge size and associated cost which eventually brought the decision to\nseparate the environmental research part of its payload from the operational meteorological\ninstruments. This led to two satellites, EnviSat carrying the first set, and MetOp the\nsecond. Both would be based on the Polar Platform (PPF) design, initially foreseen\nas a serviceable, multi-role spacecraft. In the end, EnviSat , the first to get going, grew\nsignificantly larger than when it was first split off from the full POEM -1 concept. MetOp,\nstarted later, also grew, and deviated significantly from the PPF design until only the\ngeneral arrangement and a reduced-size EnviSat-style solar array remained. Even the\nService Module was derived from SPOT -5 rather than the PPF, which had been based\non the earlier SPOT -4.\n\nEnviSat was eventually launched in 2002, the single passenger on a mighty Ariane 5\nlauncher, its 8.5 tonnes precluding any other reasonably accessible launcher. MetOp is\nquite a bit smaller, at 4.5 tonnes and the first of the three was launched by a Soyuz launch\nvehicle in 2006.\n\nLong before these launch events however, it was becoming clear that the tide was\nturning against such huge satellites. EnviSat could boast that its large suite of instruments\ncould make simultaneous measurements with widely different instruments which could\noffer more than the necessarily reduced payload of a smaller satellite. However, the cost\nof this was high. In terms of development time it was well over a decade between the\nbasic instrument designs and the first results appearing. In financial terms, the cost was\nsobering, and this was compounded by the high cost of the Ariane 5, with no other co-\npassenger to share it with. There was, in addition, the risk of all this riding on a single\nlauncher into orbit.\n\nTo exacerbate these difficulties, EnviSat\u2019s synergistic measurement capabilities were\nmatched when the NASA A-Train Constellation was devised. This is a series of more-\nor-less independent missions following each other closely in the same orbit, with only\n\n\n\n668 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\na few minutes separating them. The first, Aqua , was launched in 2002, and as of 2010\nthere were four satellites with a total of 15 instruments. This concept offers EnviSat\u2019s\nmulti-instrument approach without many of the drawbacks.\n\nIn the late 1990s, with the mood now rather firmly in favour of smaller, less ambitious\nmissions, ESA and its scientific advisory groups made a fundamental shift in the way\nmissions would be selected and implemented. A programme was defined which provides\na financial envelope sufficient for several small missions, as well as for some instrument\ndevelopment and the continuation of the ageing fleet of satellites (particularly ERS -2\nand EnviSat) past their initial funding allocations. It was called the Earth Observation\nEnvelope Programme (EOEP), and one of its more interesting features is that it comes\nin several slices, each being individually agreed (several years apart) but with missions\nhaving the possibility to split their funding between slices.\n\nWith this mechanism it became possible to define a really effective way to select\nmissions which could be much more decoupled from the need to find compromises,\nand which could win broad political support. In fact two classes of mission were initially\nspecified in the programme definition for the first slice of the EOEP. The first was foreseen\nas larger missions that could continue to be regarded as flagship, observatory missions,\nand which might also pave the way for future operational missions. These were the Core\nmissions. Then there were the Opportunity missions, which were seen as smaller missions\nwhich could be put together quickly and cheaply, intended to respond to specific scientific\ninvestigations. These would be selected later by an open, competitive process following\na call for proposals. Interestingly, this differentiation was dropped with the second and\nthird slices of the EOEP, and all missions are now selected by the mechanism used for\nthese Opportunity missions.\n\nThe first of these calls for proposals for Earth Explorer Opportunity Missions was\nmade in July 1998. Proposals were required to define a mission which would address an\nimportant scientific issue and which could be completed and launched within three years\nand cost ESA no more than \u00a4100 million, including post-launch operations. This was a\nvery tall order, considering that EnviSat (which had not yet reached the launch pad) was\ncosting about \u00a42 billion. Both its launch and ground segment cost, individually, would\nbreak the cost limit placed on these missions. In fact the situation for the proposers was\neven more stringent since the costs incurred by ESA itself would have to come from this\nsum too. So the proposals were required to be costed at less than \u00a480 million.\n\nDespite the severe cost cap, 27 proposals were made, and these entered an intensive\nevaluation process, considering both scientific and technical merits. In May 1999 ESA\npresented a paper to the Earth Observation Programme Board (PB-EO) which endorsed\nthe findings of the Earth Science Advisory Committee (ESAC). It proposed that CryoSat ,\nthe mission ranked highest by ESAC, should be implemented as the first Earth Explorer\nOpportunity Mission to be launched. It also proposed that the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity mission (SMOS ) should be prepared as the second, with flexibility maintained\nfor it to replace CryoSat should it develop problems. A third mission, the Atmosphere\nand Climate Explorer (ACE ) was also to be maintained in \u2018hot standby\u2019 to replace either\nCryoSat or SMOS .\n\nEach of the missions, as proposed, was obliged to include some sources of funding\noutside ESA. In the case of CryoSat this was relatively modest and covered the\nscientific support for the mission. SMOS , on the other hand, required substantial national\ncontributions from France and Spain which included major elements of the satellite\n\n\n\nA CASE STUDY: CRYOSAT 20.4 669\n\nand the ground segment. While this had financial advantages it added considerable\nprogrammatic complexity.\n\nBoth of these top-ranked proposals shared an important, winning argument. It became\nclear that the scientific desirability of each mission was not the deciding factor: each\nproposal made such a compelling case that ideally they would all have been funded.\nInstead the deciding question became the practical feasibility of meeting the mission\nobjectives within the strict limits of what was available. This recognition of the real\nconstraints is an important aspect of systems engineering. SMOS achieved this through\nbuilding a consortium of funding bodies, but the CryoSat case was different.\n\nCryoSat was proposed by Prof. Duncan Wingham, of University College London\n(UCL), supported by an international team, which crucially included the industrial compa-\nnies who had built the preceding European radar altimeter satellites. The team were able\nto demonstrate that virtually all of the satellite could be assembled by reusing designs\nfrom previous missions, with little extra development required. At a stroke this gave\nconfidence that the strict cost and time limits were achievable.\n\n20.4.2 Mission characteristics\n\nCryoSat is a mission designed to measure small changes in the thickness of the Earth\u2019s\nice fields, which are mainly the floating sea-ice and the ice sheets such as Greenland and\nAntarctica. It also makes measurements of smaller ice caps and larger mountain glaciers.\nUnusually, the measurement requirements are specified as a rate of change, since we are\nless interested in the annual signal than in year-to-year changes. And the magnitude of\nthe specified rate of change is small, set at about 10% of the expected variation due to\nnatural fluctuations.\n\nThis imposes requirements on the type of measurements to be made, the physical\nstability of the system, control of the measurement configuration and consistency in the\ndata processing system. The programmatic constraints imposed on the Earth Explorer\nOpportunity Missions, on the other hand, could be simply characterized as the need for\na relatively short development cycle with a stringent cost ceiling. This has become a\ncommon need in the development of space missions and the approach taken in this case\nis pertinent to many similar missions.\n\nThe original idea was that the \u2018rules\u2019 could be simplified for the Earth Explorer Oppor-\ntunity Missions, to enable them to be implemented more quickly and cheaply. This was\nthought to mean less rigorous quality, less reliable hardware and perhaps less redundant\nsystems. In reality it was very difficult to implement two sets of standards in a procurement\norganization where much expertise is drawn from outside the project team. Furthermore,\nmuch of the equipment selected had heritage from other projects and so had an intrinsic\nquality level. So inevitably CryoSat developed into a project with similar quality levels\nto other ESA missions. This meant that cost and schedule savings had to be achieved in\nother ways. One way was to reduce the size of the teams, in ESA and in industry. While\nattractive from the accountant\u2019s point of view, this did mean that individual work-loads\nwere rather high; the establishment of a strong team-spirit helped maintain motivation and\neffectiveness. The other available tool was the decision to develop a proto-flight system,\ndescribed later. The combination of these methods enabled a \u2018low-cost\u2019 mission to be\ndeveloped within the normal way of doing business.\n\n\n\n670 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\n20.4.3 Precision measurements from space\n\nThe CryoSat satellite is the part of the system which makes measurements. The funda-\nmental measure is the distance from the satellite to the surface below and for this a radar\naltimeter is used. Given that the mission was proposed in 1998 when the enormous poten-\ntial of the ERS radar altimeters over icy surfaces was being realized, this was a natural\nchoice. The other main alternative would have been a laser altimeter and this selection\nwas made in the case of the US ICEsat mission, which unfortunately failed just a few\nmonths before CryoSat-2 made it into orbit in 2010, despite the efforts of the ICESat\nteam to conserve their lasers by only operating a few months each year. In fact laser and\nradar altimeters are really complementary in this application and it is a great pity that\nsimultaneous measurements could not be made.\n\nCryoSat\u2019s radar altimeter is called SIRAL, a contraction of SAR and Interferometric\nRadar Altimeter , and this indicates where improvements have been made in the instrument\nconcept. As well as a conventional mode, which offers continuity with earlier missions, the\nradar can also operate in synthetic aperture mode. This increases the along-track resolution,\nenabling it to more readily distinguish the narrow \u2018leads\u2019 of open water between sea-ice\nfloes. Over the rough terrain at the edges of the major ice sheets this increased along-track\nresolution is further augmented by across-track interferometry using the second antenna\nand receive channel. The derived angle of arrival of the radar echoes allows a more\nprecise identification of the point from which the echo came.\n\nSIRAL makes measurements of the range to the surface which is very precise: each\nmeasurement has an uncertainty of a few tens of centimetres (the standard deviation,\nmeasured in-orbit, in its SAR-Interferometric mode is 18 cm). The averaging of many\nsuch measurements brings the system performance to the level needed to satisfy the\nmission objectives. However the precise measurement of range alone is insufficient. The\nposition of the satellite at the time of each measurement is needed to convert this simple\nmeasure of range to something scientifically meaningful, that is, the height of the surface\nabove some known reference. Loosely we may talk of height above sea-level, but in\nthis demandingly precise application we refer to height above a reference ellipsoid , an\nexactly defined, oblate spheroidal surface which closely approximates the shape of the\nEarth. In order to determine the satellite\u2019s position, and thus its height above this reference\nellipsoid, measurements from some further payload equipment are needed.\n\nCryoSat includes a DORIS (Determination of Orbit and Radiopositioning Integrated\nby Satellite) receiver, a special radio receiver which picks up signals from a network\nof more than 50 transmitting stations spread evenly over the Earth. By measuring the\nDoppler shift of these signals the range-rate to each one is determined. The accuracy\nof the orbit which may be computed from such a data-set obviously depends on several\nfactors, not least the precision and accuracy of the Doppler shift measurements. In this,\nDORIS excels and since the early 1990s the DORIS system has been the foremost means\nof routine, high-precision orbit determination (by 2010 systems based on space-borne\nGPS receivers could match the performance). The DORIS receiver is augmented by a\npassive laser retro-reflector, which allows precise range measurements to be made by\nground-based laser ranging stations.\n\nThe final item in this collection of high-precision payload equipment is a set of star\ntrackers. These are needed to complement the SIRAL interferometer measurement. SIRAL\nmeasures the angle of arrival of the echo in its own reference frame, that is, with respect\n\n\n\nA CASE STUDY: CRYOSAT 20.4 671\n\nto the line joining the centres of the two antennas, the baseline. Before that information\ncan be used to identify the exact position on the Earth we must know the orientation\nof that baseline, and in order to meet the mission objectives this measure must also be\nprecise\u2014within 30 arc-seconds.\n\nThe scientific mission objectives not only defined the type and accuracy of the mea-\nsurements which had to be made (which led to the payload selection) but also where\nand when. This \u2018where and when\u2019 is encapsulated in the definition of a specific orbit for\nCryoSat . The orbital inclination is 92? (and therefore retrograde) with a mean altitude of\nabout 720 km, the exact altitude being defined by the required track repeat characteris-\ntics. This orbit is not Sun-synchronous (see Chapter 5) in which the orbit plane keeps a\nfixed orientation with respect to the Sun. Such a synchronous orbit would have undesir-\nable tidal aliasing characteristics. Furthermore, this orbit requirement had impacts on the\nsatellite design.\n\n20.4.4 Designing the system\n\nThe full CryoSat system has several parts, and although those which remain on the\nEarth will not be described here, we shall outline the overall architecture as this has\nimpacts on the design of all of the elements. Programmatic constraints were dominant\nin this part of the system definition and led to the minimum configuration required to\nsatisfy the mission objectives. The key feature is that a single ground station is used for\nCryoSat , both for command and control and for downlink, processing and distribution of\nthe science data. The ESA ground station at Kiruna was selected. As well as enabling the\nsharing of resources with other on-going ESA missions, this choice resulted in manageable\nrequirements to cope with the three to four consecutive orbits per day where contact with\nthe ground station is not possible. For stations at lower latitudes this would be a larger\nnumber, while for the higher latitude of Svalbard the number of these \u2018blind\u2019 orbits\nis reduced to zero, but the opportunity to share costs with other ESA missions would\nnot exist.\n\nThe design of the CryoSat satellite was determined, as is always the case, by a number\nof key factors. From the science mission objectives came the payload complement and\nits requirements, the orbit and the minimum lifetime. Programmatic constraints included\nthe need to operate from a single ground station, launch on a \u2018small\u2019 (and therefore low-\ncost) launcher, extensive on-board autonomy, a low-cost design and a decision to forego\nthe normal approach of building precursor \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 models of the satellite (the\nso-called Structure Model, Engineering Model, etc.\u2014see Chapters 8 and 17).\n\nThese driving factors do not lead inevitably to the CryoSat design (indeed during the\ncompetitive feasibility study phase, another, entirely different, concept was developed)\nbut many of the main features of the CryoSat design can be traced to these drivers.\nIn many missions the heritage from other programmes has a role to play in the design\nof a particular spacecraft. In this case, the CHAMP and GRACE satellites, which were\ndesigned against similar orbit and programmatic constraints, had a significant bearing on\nthe final design of CryoSat .\n\nInstead of a rather ponderous deduction of CryoSat\u2019s design from the mission\u2019s require-\nments and constraints, in the following discussion CryoSat will be reversed engineered\nto show how it responds to these drivers. The spacecraft is shown in Figure 20.12. We\nshall start with the most obvious feature: its shape.\n\n\n\n672 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nFigure 20.12 The CryoSat configuration. (Reproduced by permission of ESA/P. Carril)\n\nThe required orbit is not Sun-synchronous. Every day the orbit plane shifts almost\n3 min earlier with respect to the Sun; in eight months the orbital plane drifts through\nall local times. This means that the direction from which sunlight falls on the satellite\nis constantly changing. The operation of the SIRAL demands that its antennas point\ntowards the Earth\u2019s surface to within a few tenths of a degree, and furthermore that the\ntwo antennas are arranged side by side (across-track) as the satellite flies. This means\nthat rotating the satellite to face the Sun is out of the question. Mechanisms on satellites\nare very costly\u2014a rule of thumb suggests that each one costs about \u00a41 million\u2014so the\nCryoSat geometry was arranged such that every orbit has enough sunlight on one or both\nof the solar panels to maintain an overall positive energy balance.\n\nOf course this assumes that the solar panels have the intrinsic capability to generate\nenough power in the first place, if the Sun were shining directly on them. The requirement\nto fit CryoSat inside the fairing of a \u2018small\u2019 launcher placed absolute constraints on the\nsize of the panels, thus removing one of the key degrees of freedom in this equation.\nThat only left one parameter to ensure sufficient power generation\u2014the efficiency of\nthe solar cells. Thus CryoSat , a low-cost mission, ended up pioneering the use of new,\nhigh-efficiency solar cells in low-Earth orbit. It should be noted that this choice was still\ncheaper than introducing fold-out panels and emphasizes the goal of system engineering,\nand that the best overall solution may require some areas to have additional complexity\nand cost in order to reduce the overall complexity and cost of the mission.\n\nThe two antennas of the SIRAL are accommodated near the front of the satellite,\nside by side. The antennas are elliptical in outline in order to fit within the launcher\nfairing\u2014this slightly complicates the scientific data processing but has no impact on\nperformance. We have already implied that both the structural stability and knowledge\n\n\n\nA CASE STUDY: CRYOSAT 20.4 673\n\nof this assembly are vital to the mission performance, and the design has a number of\nspecial features to ensure this. In the calm environment of space the principal enemy of\nstability is heat, which causes expansion. Astronomy missions have the same enemy but\ncan select orbits with a very benign thermal environment. This is clearly not possible for\nan earth observation spacecraft. To guard against this enemy, therefore, the first line of\ndefence is to use materials which are least susceptible to it. Mainly this requires the use\nof carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) which has a coefficient of thermal expansion\nclose to zero. This is used for the antennas themselves and for the substantial \u2018bench\u2019\nupon which they are mounted, and the mounts for the star trackers fitted to this bench.\nInvar, a low-expansion metal originally used for the pendulums of clocks, was also used.\nHowever the majority of the satellite is aluminium, so another vital part of the defence\nis isolation. The sensitive antenna bench is attached to the rest of the satellite by a three-\npoint quasi-isostatic suspension, which minimizes the transfer of thermal distortions and\nheat variations. The theme of isolation is carried further by the wrapping of the antenna\nbench structure as so obviously illustrated in Figure 20.12. Not only is the bench and all\nits attachments well wrapped in multi-layer insulation, but even the antenna apertures are\nprotected from the hot Sun by an exotic single-layer insulation, coated with microwave-\ntransparent germanium.\n\n20.4.5 The payload: re-use and innovation\n\nLike all of the equipment on CryoSat , the SIRAL radar altimeter is derived from existing\nequipment; here a conventional pulsewidth-limited altimeter called Poseidon-2, which is\nflying on the US-French Jason mission, is used. SIRAL is a single frequency Ku-band\nradar which uses the full deramp range compression technique. It also features some new\ndesign characteristics which enable it to provide data which can be more elaborately pro-\ncessed on ground. A high pulse repetition frequency and pulse-to-pulse phase coherence\nare needed for the along-track SAR processing. The across-track interferometry needs a\nsecond complete receiver chain, including the second antenna. These features make this\ninstrument unique.\n\nThe electronics of the radar are divided into a number of separate units, principally for\nease of manufacturing and testing. One large unit houses all the digital electronics, and\nthe remaining boxes contain radio frequency circuitry and the transmitter\u2019s power supply.\nSeveral innovations were necessary compared to the Poseidon-2 equipment, most notably\nin the need for significantly increased transmitter power, which led to the development\nof a complete new transmitter section, and in the provision of the second receive path.\n\nA less obvious but far more pervasive change was the new requirement for phase\nstability, introduced by both the SAR and interferometric functions. Phase had never been\nan issue with previous altimeters but for SIRAL it is critical. In consequence, the SIRAL\ndevelopment has seen much analysis, measurement, characterization, optimization and\ntuning, as well as the introduction of some special means of calibrating phase performance\nin-flight.\n\nThe antenna subsystem has not been immune to this. It was developed as a discrete\nitem and consists of two Cassegrain antennas mounted side-by-side on the rigid antenna\nbench. Both antennas are identical, but one is used both to transmit and receive whereas\nthe other is only used to receive echoes. The Cassegrain design offers particular advantages\nfor the SIRAL as the resulting waveguide lengths are much shorter than those required for\n\n\n\n674 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nthe more common, front-fed, design. The entire assembly went through a measurement\ncampaign which challenged the capabilities of the test facility due to the exacting phase\nmeasurement requirements.\n\nThe SIRAL on the original CryoSat was non-redundant, but for CryoSat-2 the deci-\nsion was quickly made that, for a mission offering a second chance, there should be no\npossibility of mission loss through a single-point failure, and so the SIRAL became fully\nredundant. This, of course introduced a number of other changes: two sets of connections\nwere required for power, for the MilBus 1553 used for command and control, for the\n1355 connections used for high speed data and for the reference oscillator input from the\nDORIS. Extra switching and commands were needed, as well as a means of toggling and\nmonitoring the waveguide switch used for selection of which unit was connected to the\nantennas. This simple change had many ramifications, and these also extended into many\nareas of the ground segment.\n\nThe low-resolution mode of the SIRAL operates in the same way as a conventional\npulsewidth-limited altimeter and uses a single receive channel. The rate at which the radar\npulses are transmitted is low (relatively speaking\u2014it is 1970 per second) and the echoes\nare transformed from the time domain to the spectral domain and averaged on-board. The\ndata rate at which science data are generated in this mode is therefore low, at 51 kbps.\nThis mode will be used over ice sheet interiors, where the slopes of the surface are small.\nIt will also be used over the ocean.\n\nIn the SAR mode, which also uses a single receive channel, the along-track horizontal\nresolution of the altimeter is improved by exploiting the Doppler properties of the echoes,\nduring the on-ground processing. The result is equivalent to decomposing the main antenna\nbeam into a set of 64 narrower synthetic beams along-track. The footprints of the different\nsub-beams over a flat surface are adjacent rectangular areas ?250 m wide along-track\nand as large as the antenna footprint across-track (up to 15 km). Consequently, a larger\nnumber of independent measurements are available over a given area, and this property\nis used to enhance the accuracy of the measurements over sea ice. In order to ensure the\ncoherence between echoes from successive pulses, the pulse repetition frequency is about\n10 times higher than for the low resolution mode. The instrument operates in bursts, with\na group of 64 pulses transmitted together, then a pause during which the echoes arrive.\nThe echoes are stored on-board in the time domain, without any averaging. Therefore the\ndata rate is significantly higher, at 11.3 Mbps.\n\nThe SAR-Interferometric mode (SARIn) is used mainly over the margins of the ice\nsheets, where the surface slopes are high. The combination of SAR and interferometry\nmakes it possible to accurately determine the arrival direction of the echoes both along\nand across the satellite track, by comparing the phase of one receive channel with respect\nto the other. In this mode, both receive channels are active and the corresponding echoes\nare stored in the time domain. The data rate is about twice as high as for SAR mode. In\norder to cope with abrupt height variations, the range-tracking concept for this mode has\nto be particularly robust. In SIRAL, this is ensured by using narrow-band tracking pulses,\ntransmitted in-between successive wide-band measurement bursts.\n\nCryoSat includes a set of three identical star trackers, which are the only means of\ndetermining the orientation of the SIRAL interferometric baseline. They are also the\nprincipal three-axis attitude measurement sensor in the nominal operating mode. They are\nlightweight, low power consuming, fully autonomous devices. They are accommodated\n\n\n\nA CASE STUDY: CRYOSAT 20.4 675\n\nsuch that the Sun and Moon can each blind only one head at any time; this makes the\nwhole sensor system one-failure tolerant.\n\nThe star trackers are fully autonomous, with no need for ground update of star maps.\nIn the acquisition mode, which takes 2\u20133 s, the star tracker calculates a coarse attitude\nby matching triangle patterns of stars with patterns stored in its catalogue. After two\nconsecutive successful initial acquisitions it autonomously jumps to attitude update mode\nin which it uses information from the last attitude update to calculate a precise attitude,\nat a rate of up to 1.7 Hz.\n\nThe star tracker algorithm is optimized to use rather faint stars, around magnitude 5.\nThese stars, which are barely visible to the naked eye except at dark sites, are far more\nnumerous than the brighter stars and provide many triangles for use in the pattern matching\nprocess in all directions of the sky.\n\n20.4.6 What makes it tick?\n\nAll of the data generated by the scientific payload of CryoSat have to be recorded on-board\nas the satellite is only in contact with its single ground station for brief periods. Typically\nthere are 10 passes of duration 5\u201310 min each day, occurring on consecutive orbits. These\ncontacts are followed by a gap of three to four \u2018blind orbits\u2019. To handle the large data\nvolume, a data recorder of capacity 256 Gbits is installed. Following the modern trend,\nthis is realized as solid-state memory\u2014literally thousands of RAM chips. The unit is\nderived from similar equipment on Mars Express and, of course, comprehensive memory\nmanagement and data handling functions are built in. It can continue recording data as it\nreplays it into the data-link to the ground station.\n\nThis downlink is a potential bottleneck as the total contact time is relatively short.\nTo avoid this, the downlink data rate is high at around 100 Mbps. Again this is built\non heritage, this time from MetOp, with the frequency and bandwidth reused from an\nallocation originally given to EnviSat .\n\nCryoSat is an unusual satellite in that it has virtually no moving parts, the only excep-\ntions are a couple of valves in the propulsion system. This has led to savings in cost as well\nas testing. One area where this lack is particularly noticeable is in the attitude and orbit\ncontrol subsystem, where gyroscopes and reaction wheels are normally commonplace.\n\nAttitude control (see also Chapter 9) for CryoSat is innovative since it principally uses\ntwo of the payload equipments; another example of re-use. The star tracker provides real-\ntime measurements of the satellite orientation with respect to the stars, which together\nwith the DORIS time and orbit information allows the on-board software to calculate\nthe orientation with respect to the Earth. Measurement is half of the problem\u2014it is\nalso necessary to produce torques which will turn the satellite as needed to keep the\nEarth-pointing within the required tolerance. CryoSat\u2019s main means of generating such\ntorques is to use electro-magnets interacting with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. These devices,\ncalled magnetic torquers, are simply multiple turns of wire wrapped around a ferrite core,\npowered by a controllable electric current from the main computer. Magnetic torquers\ncannot produce torque around the direction of the Earth\u2019s field itself, and this direction\nconstantly changes with respect to the satellite as it moves along its orbit. So a \u2018backstop\u2019\ncontrol guards against excessive pointing errors\u2014a set of small cold-gas thrusters. These\nare very small indeed, with a thrust of 10 mN\u2014about the same as the weight of 1 cm3 of\nwater. Pre-launch simulation showed that these would fire for a total of about 3 s per orbit\n\n\n\n676 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nwhich would lead to a consumption of about 3 g of gas per day. In reality however, the\ngas consumption is significantly less, at about 6 g per week. Although this is not much,\nit will, together with the gas used by the two 40 mN thrusters used to maintain the orbit\nagainst air-drag, eventually consume the 35 kg of pressurized nitrogen on-board.\n\nThe attitude control system has other sensors too, used during the initial stabilization\nafter separation from the launcher, and in emergencies. These are a set of magnetometers\nand an ingenious sensor, the combined Earth-Sun sensor (CESS), which measures the\ntemperature difference between a black and a mirror surface on each face of the satellite.\nA clever piece of software then calculates the direction to both Sun and Earth.\n\nA point related to attitude control is the question of what to do if the satellite has a\nserious failure and has to enter a so-called \u2018safe-mode\u2019. The idea here is that the satellite\nneeds a robust attitude control mode which it can maintain with minimal resource usage\nand which guarantees that the solar arrays continue to generate enough power to keep the\nsatellite alive. For satellites with rotating solar arrays (such as ERS -1) this is a real design\nissue since the solar array has to be moved to a specific position and then the satellite\npointing adjusted to keep it in the Sun. This is likely to be a different orientation from\nthe normal Earth-pointing modes.\n\nFor CryoSat , with its fixed, body-mounted solar arrays, the approach is simpler. The\nsatellite changes to a more robust control mode, using only the CESS and magnetometers\nfor attitude measurement, and the magnetic torquers for attitude control. The satellite\nremains Earth pointing, and the nadir panel remains the primary radiator.\n\n20.4.7 Putting it together\n\nOne of the key means by which the CryoSat programme was able to compress schedule\nand costs lay in a bold early decision. The idea was that by embracing existing equipment\ndesigns and building-in conservative margins, it would be possible to directly build a\nproto-flight satellite. No test articles would be built.\n\nThe savings inherent in such an approach were very persuasive, both in time and\nin equipment. However, it was obvious that the benefit of test models, particularly the\nengineering model (EM), goes beyond merely testing the hardware. The test model allows\nunglamorous but essential work, such as test procedure debugging, to be done away from\nthe critical path. So for CryoSat it was decided to build a virtual satellite in software. This\nhas been so useful for various aspects of testing that it has been cloned several times, a\nfeat rather difficult to perform with a hardware version.\n\nIn some ways, of course, the original CryoSat acted as the EM for CryoSat-2, but this\nwould not be completely correct since CryoSat-2, despite being a rebuild, accumulated a\nlarge number of changes compared to the original. The redundant SIRAL was an obvious\nexample, but there were almost a hundred significant changes. The effect of all of these\nwas that virtually every test procedure needed to be checked and a large number rewritten.\n\nThe proto-flight CryoSat was ready for final testing in mid-2004, and the same process\nwas followed for CryoSat-2 which moved into the test facilities at IABG in Otto-\nbrunn, near Munich, in September 2008. Environmental testing is an inescapable ordeal\nand involves a long programme of \u2018torture\u2019 for the satellite. CryoSat-2 had to face\nit again\u2014the satellite design had changed sufficiently to render the previous testing\ninvalid, and in the case of the mechanical testing, a different launch vehicle had been\n\n\n\nA CASE STUDY: CRYOSAT 20.4 677\n\nselected for the new satellite, so requiring a new set of qualification tests (see also\nChapters 17 and 19).\n\nSo CryoSat-2 endured mass properties measurement, vibration testing, acoustic testing,\nEMC testing, thermal vacuum and thermal balance testing in a vacuum chamber, RF auto-\ncompatibility testing, flash testing to check the solar array performance, launcher-related\nradiated emission and susceptibility testing and finally a shock separation test using the\nactual flight adapter, brought to Munich by the launch provider.\n\nIn-between times, CryoSat-2 went through many standard health tests, both as diag-\nnostics and for status checking. There were also some System Validation Tests to verify\nthat the mission control centre at ESOC was able to flawlessly monitor and control it.\n\n20.4.8 Getting it up there\n\nThe original CryoSat was launched with a Rockot launch vehicle. This is a converted\nSS-19 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with a versatile, restartable upper stage\ncalled Breeze-KM. The launch, from Plesetsk, some 800 km north of Moscow, occurred\non 8th October 2005. At 300 s after launch the control system encountered an incorrect\nsequence of two commands and as a result the second stage engine suffered a catastrophic\nfailure, which resulted in the mission being terminated. CryoSat , the unused Breeze KM\nstage and the empty second stage then continued a ballistic trajectory, reentering, and\nfinally exploding at about 40 km altitude near the North Pole.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry clearly identified the fault and remedial measures to ensure\nthat it could not recur. Rockot has subsequently had an unbroken safety record and has\nlaunched two more recent Earth Explorers (GOCE and SMOS ). Nevertheless, CryoSat-2\nwas launched on a different launcher, a Dnepr, which is a converted SS-18 ICBM. The\nreason for this change was unrelated to the earlier failure. It was simply a question of\navailability since the Breeze-KM stages are in short supply, while Dnepr uses the entire\nSS-18 with little change.\n\nThe launch time is selected so that the orbital plane is at right angles to the direction\nto the Sun, and the Dnepr launcher performs a direct injection, without a cruise phase.\nThe launch, from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, is in a southerly direction. The first stage\nfalls on land, in a deserted region of Turkmenistan, while the fairing and second stage\nfall in the Indian Ocean. Dnepr is an unusual launch vehicle\u2014as a result of its ICBM\nheritage the third stage performs a 180? turn after separation and its engines extend on\narms to point back along its flanks. It then flies backwards, dragging the payload behind\nit, which remains protected by a Gas Dynamic Shield (GDS). Two seconds before payload\nseparation the GDS is released, followed by severing of the connection to the satellite.\nThe upper stage moves away under the power of its engines, so that separation springs are\nnot needed. The deployment is shown in Figure 20.13. This method yields a very precise\ninjection. As a result of this though, CryoSat could not have its telemetry transmitter on\nwhile in the GDS so that, even though the vehicle was in view of the Malindi ground\nstation, no contact could be achieved until the transmitter was switched on some 14 s\nafter separation. Following the experience with the original CryoSat exactly four years\nand six months earlier, the acquisition of this signal generated a certain amount of relief\nand good cheer.\n\n\n\n678 SPACECRAFT SYSTEM ENGINEERING\n\nFigure 20.13 Dnepr injection of CryoSat. (Reproduced by permission of ESA/P. Carril)\n\n20.5 CONCLUSION\n\nThe discussion in this chapter illustrates that whilst space systems engineering has a\nrelatively long heritage and many of the fundamental technologies discussed in this book\nremain the same, there have been some important advances. One of these, Concurrent\nEngineering, utilizes the huge improvements in information technology to speed up and\nenhance the iterative, interdisciplinary nature of space systems engineering. The other\nsection in this chapter on the CryoSat spacecraft demonstrates that whilst there are an\nincreasing number of tools available to optimize a spacecraft design, pragmatic decisions\nhave to be made with a real mission operating within a limited budget, in order to achieve\na successful outcome.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] ECSS-E-ST-10C Space Engineering\u2014System Engineering General Requirements.\n[2] CDF Info Pack (2011), http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/cdf/CDF_INFOPACK_2011.pdf\n\n(accessed 14 February 2011).\n\n\n\nIndex\n\nA\nABM, 134, 136, 205\u2013206, 232\u2013233, 235\nAC magnetic fields, 532\u2013533\nacceptance, 268\u2013269, 357, 452, 474, 482, 486,\n\n493, 546, 548, 550, 553, 556\u2013557, 559,\n562\u2013563, 572, 586, 591, 627, 631, 633,\n636, 639\u2013640, 647\u2013648, 662\n\nACS,\naccuracy specification, 290\nblock diagram, 293\u2013294\ncomputation, 321\u2013326\ndesign objective, 290\nmission-related system considerations,\n\n290\u2013292\noverview, 290\u2013294\n\nactive damping, 298, 300\nactive debris removal, 35\nactive pixel detector arrays, 462\nactive thermal control, 375, 380, 383, 389\n\nBrayton cycle, 386\u2013387\nheat pumps, 385\u2013386\nheaters, 380\u2013381\nJoule-Thompson cooler, 386\nliquid loops, 383\u2013384\nlouvres, shutters, 384\u2013385\nRankine cycle, 385\nStirling cycle, 386\u2013387\nvariable conductance heat pipes, 381\u2013383\n\nadvanced orbiting systems (AOS), 446, 456\naero-assisted orbit transfer, 168\naerobraking, 168\naerocapture, 169\naerodynamic torques, 305\u2013306\naeromanoeuvring, 168\nair-breathing propulsion systems, 197\u2013199\n\nSpacecraft Systems Engineering, Fourth Edition.\nEdited by Peter W.
